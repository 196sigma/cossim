REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF RAWLINGS SPORTING GOODS COMPANY, INC. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rawlings
Sporting Goods Company, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the
Company as of August 31, 2000 and 1999 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended August 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Rawlings Sporting Goods
Company, Inc. and subsidiaries as of August 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the

28 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Amounts in thousands, except share and per share data
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rawlings Sporting
Goods Company, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries Rawlings or the
Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated.
BUSINESS
Rawlings manufactures and distributes sports equipment and uniforms for team
sports such as baseball, basketball, and football predominately in the United
States. Revenue is recorded when product is shipped. Returns and sales
allowances are included in net revenues.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost
determined on a first-in, first-out method. Cost includes materials and
conversion costs.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. The principal estimated
useful lives are as follows                           
Buildings and improvements          20-30 years
Machinery and equipment            5-12 years
Other                     4-10 years When equipment is sold or retired, its cost and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss is included in income
during the period of the disposition. Repair and maintenance is charged to
expense as incurred.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, and goodwill.
Long-lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the assets with the expected future undiscounted cash flows
before consideration of income taxes. If an impairment has occurred on assets
held for use, the loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying
value of the asset and the present value of the estimated net future cash flows
or the comparable market value, giving consideration to recent operating
performance. Long-lived assets that are to be disposed are recorded at the lower
of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.                    26
29
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences in reporting income
and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Incomes
Taxes SFAS No. 109.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The assets and liabilities of foreign branches and subsidiaries are translated
into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and profit and loss accounts are
translated at average annual exchange rates. Resulting translation gains and
losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate
component in Stockholders' Equity. Foreign exchange transaction losses of $0 10 and $0 were included in the results of operations for the fiscal years ended
August 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The fair value of the Company financial instruments approximates their
carrying amounts. The Company long-term debt is primarily variable in nature
and accordingly the fair value approximates the carrying value.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements
to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassifications had no
impact on previously reported net income loss or total stockholders' equity.
USE OF ESTIMATES
These financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting
which requires the use of certain estimates in determining the Company assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Resolution of certain matters could differ
significantly from the resolution that is currently expected.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
During 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF discussed several reporting
issues related to accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs. In
connection with the issuance of EITF 00-10, a consensus was reached that all
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling should be reported as a
component of net revenues in the statement of income. Historically, the Company
has recorded the amount billed as an offset to the costs incurred and recorded
the net amount in selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company is
currently in the process of quantifying the amount of the reclassification and
will reflect the needed adjustments in the statements of income by the fourth
quarter of 2001 in accordance with the pronouncement. There will be no impact to
the Company net income loss as a result of the adoption of this new
pronouncement.                    27

NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED SEGMENT
On June 26, 2000 the Company made a strategic decision to seek a buyer
for its Vic hockey business. Vic provides an extensive line of equipment for
hockey teams including hockey sticks, hockey protective equipment and goalie
protective equipment. The sale of the Vic hockey business is expected to be
completed during fiscal 2001. Vic hockey is accounted for as a discontinued
segment, and accordingly, operating results and net assets are segregated in the
Company financial statements and related notes for all periods presented.
The net current assets of this discontinued segment are primarily
accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Net
noncurrent assets are primarily property, plant and equipment.
Operating results for the hockey business are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income as net loss from discontinued segment for all
periods presented. Results for the discontinued segment are as follows                           2000    1999    1998
Net revenues                    $ 8,383  $ 8,184  $ 8,604
Loss from operations of discontinued
segment before incomes taxes         $ 2,744  $ 1,392  $  822
Benefit for income taxes                430    513    331
Net loss from operations of discontinued segment  $ 2,314  $  879  $  491
Loss on disposal of discontinued segment before
income taxes                 $13,000  $   --  $   Benefit for income taxes               1,674     --                                     Net loss on disposal of discontinued segment    $11,326  $   --  $                                  The loss on disposal includes the writedown of assets of the hockey business
$10,750 to estimated net realizable value, the provision for operating losses
during the phaseout period of $1,500 and the estimated costs to dispose of this
business of $750.

On December 28, 1999, the Company refinanced its credit facility by entering
into a $75,000 five-year credit agreement expiring December 1, 2004 with a new
financial institution. Actual availability is based on the Company outstanding
receivables and inventories. Total availability at August 31, 2000 was
approximately $4,337. The facility also allows for a $4,000 seasonal advance
from November through April. Borrowings under the agreement are based on an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 225 percent. A commitment fee of 050 percent is
charged on any unused portion of the facility.
The extraordinary item of $646 recorded in fiscal 2000 was due to the write-off
of deferred financing costs associated with the early extinguishment of the
previous credit facility.
On May 15, 2000 and on July 20, 2000 the Company and its lenders amended the
credit agreement to convert $2,500 term loan A and $7,500 term loan B,
respectively, of the facility to term loans. The term loans provide for monthly
installment payments and the aggregate                    31
34
outstanding principal balance of the term loans becomes due and payable in full
on the termination date of the credit facility. The term loans bear interest at
LIBOR plus 250 percent and LIBOR plus 275 percent, respectively. The revolving
loan agreement limit was reduced to $65,000 as part of the July 20, 2000
amendment.
The credit facility includes various restrictions, including requirements that
the Company achieve certain EBITDA levels as defined in the agreement, maintain
a fixed charge ratio of 11 to 1 and limit capital expenditures and restrict the
payment of dividends. In accordance with EITF 95-22 Balance Sheet
Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that
Include Both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement, the
Company has classified the revolving credit facility as a current obligation.
The Company principal debt maturities for the five years subsequent to August
31, 2000 are $1,539, $1,535, $1,471, $1,471 and $39,566, respectively.
NOTE 9. OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES
In July 1994, Figgie International, Inc. the former parent transferred the net
assets of the Rawlings business to the Company. The assets and liabilities
transferred to Rawlings were recorded at the predecessor cost for financial
reporting purposes. For tax purposes, the transaction resulted in a step-up of
the basis of the assets transferred determined by the fair value paid by the
Company for the Rawlings business. Under the terms of a tax sharing and
separation agreement between the Company and the former parent, the Company is
required to pay the former parent 43 percent of the tax benefits resulting from
the step-up in the tax basis of the assets as the benefit of the step-up is
realized. The amount of the obligation to pay the former parent that is not
expected to be paid in the next year is recorded as other long-term liabilities.
NOTE 10. UNUSUAL CHARGES
2000 UNUSUAL CHARGES
During the first quarter of 2000, the Company completed a voluntary early
retirement program for certain of its employees. The cost of the program totaled
approximately $759 and has been substantially paid out as of August 31, 2000.
The costs primarily related to severance and medical benefits. Additionally,
during the first half of 2000, the Company completed a review of its strategic
alternatives that cost approximately $738.
ENVIRONMENTAL
The Company has been conducting environmental investigation and remediation
activities at its Dolgeville, New York facility the Site with respect to the
release of wood pitch into surrounding soil and surface water. In November 1997,
the Company entered into a Voluntary Agreement with the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation the NYSDEC to conduct certain
environmental remediation activities related to the presence of wood pitch in
the soils at the Site. The wood pitch was generated as a result of the
operation, before Rawlings' ownership of the Site, of a retort facility by a
third party unrelated to Rawlings.                    32
35
In May 1998, the Company environmental consultants completed an investigation
of the amount of the wood pitch at the Site. Based upon the report received from
the environmental consultants and the Company historical experience with
environmental matters at this Site, the Company recorded a $975 charge to
remediate the additional unanticipated wood pitch, which is reflected in unusual
charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for 1998. During
October 2000, the Company completed the excavation and removal of the wood pitch
and is currently awaiting clearance from the NYSDEC. Based on discussions with
legal counsel and environmental engineers, the remaining reserve as of August
31, 2000 is adequate to provide for the remaining payments and remediation
activities.
A roll-forward of the Company environmental reserve is as follows                    2000    1999    1998
Beginning of year   $  987  $ 1,082  $  893

Payments         209    95   786
End of year      $  778  $  987  $ 1,082
In June 1998, the Company filed an action in the Northern District of New York
against Trident Rowan Group, Inc. Trident Rowan, which the Company believes is
the successor to the entity which owned the wood pitch Site during the period in
which the wood pitch contamination occurred. The Company believes that the case
against Trident Rowan is strong and all or a portion of the clean up costs
associated with the wood pitch at the Site may be recoverable. However, due to
the uncertainty associated with this matter, no receivable associated with a
potential recovery has been recorded at this time and there can be no assurance
that any amount will be recovered.
CHANGE IN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
In October 1997, the Company recorded a $500 charge for severance and related
benefits, legal costs and other costs associated with changes in the Chief
Executive Officer position. This charge has been included in unusual charges
in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.
NOTE 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
COMPANY-SPONSORED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
Substantially all U.S. salaried employees and certain U.S. hourly employees are
covered by a defined contribution Section 401k plan that provides funding
based on a percentage of compensation. The Company contributions to the plan
were $303, $323 and $327 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.                    33
36
MULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS
Certain union employees participate in multi-employer defined benefit pension
plans. Contributions to the plans were $65, $171 and $194 in 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
NOTE 12. STOCK OPTIONS
The 1994 Rawlings Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended the 1994 Incentive
Plan, provides for the issuance of up to 1,125,000 shares of Rawlings common
stock upon the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, and as
restricted stock, deferred stock, stock granted as a bonus or in lieu of other
awards and other equity-based awards. The 1994 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan
the 1994 Directors Stock Plan provides for the issuance of up to 50,000 shares
of Rawlings common stock to non-employee directors upon the exercise of stock
options or in lieu of director fees. The 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock
Plan the 2000 Directors Stock Plan provides for the issuance of up to 25,000
shares of Rawlings common stock to non-employee directors upon exercise of stock
options or in lieu of directors' fees. The Employment Agreement by and between
Rawlings and Stephen M. O'Hara, Chief Executive Officer the Employment
Agreement, provides for the issuance of up to 450,000 shares of Rawlings common
stock upon exercise of stock options.
Stock options granted under the 1994 Incentive Plan, the 1994 Directors Stock
Plan and the 2000 Directors Stock Plan have exercise prices equal to the market
price on the date of grant, vest over three to four years from the date of grant
and, once vested, are generally exercisable over ten years following the date of
grant.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option
plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 2000, 1999
and 1998 consistent with the provisions of this statement, the Company net
income and net income per share would have been as follows    Pro forma            2000      1999     1998

NOTE 13. WARRANTS
In November 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase 925,804 shares of
common stock at $1200 per share to Bull Run Corporation for $307 per warrant.
The warrants expire in November 2001 and are exercisable only if the Company
common stock closes above $1650 for twenty consecutive trading days. One half
of the purchase price of the warrants was paid in cash with the other half
payable with interest at 7 percent at the time of exercise or expiration of the
warrants. The receivable for the unpaid portion of the warrants is classified as
a stock subscription receivable in the accompanying balance sheet. These
warrants are not considered in the Company earnings per share calculation
until the point in time that the warrants become exercisable.
NOTE 14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During 2000 and 1999, the Company sold approximately $355 and $285,
respectively, of products to a professional baseball club in which two of the
Company directors are part owners and one of which is the secretary and
treasurer. The Company believes that the terms and prices for the sale of these
products are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company purchased
approximately $140 and $442, respectively, of catalogs, promotional items and
web services from a company in which one of the Company directors is the Chief
Executive Officer. The Company believes that the terms and prices for these
purchases are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.
NOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company operates certain facilities and equipment under operating lease
agreements. The lease expense was $2,144, $1,873, and $2,158 for years 2000,

In the normal course of doing business, Rawlings is subject to various federal,
state and local environmental laws. Rawlings currently is working with the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation in addressing contamination
relating to wood pitch located at its facility in Dolgeville, New York. See
Note 10 Unusual Charges for additional discussion of the Dolgeville
environmental matter.
Rawlings is periodically subjected to product liability claims and proceedings
involving its patents and other legal proceedings; such proceedings have not had
a material adverse effect on Rawlings.
In the opinion of management, ultimate liabilities resulting from pending
environmental matters and other legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations.
NOTE 16. OPERATING SEGMENTS
Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate
financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company has identified operating segments based on internal
management reports. Aggregation of similar operating segments into a single
reportable operating segment is permitted if the businesses are considered to
have similar long-term economic characteristics. The Company has four operating
segments based on its product categories, which in applying the aggregation
criteria, have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Sports Equipment
and Licensing.                    37

Consolidated total assets    $ 108,725  $ 120,675  $ 131,838
The sports equipment segment manufactures and distributes sports equipment and
uniforms for team sports including baseball, basketball, and football. The
licensing segment licenses the Rawlings brand name on products sold by other
companies and includes products such as footwear and activewear. There are no
significant determinable operating expenses or interest costs for the licensing
segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in Note 1 for the Company. The revenues generated and long-lived assets located
outside the United States are not significant for separate presentation. One
customer purchases of products sold by Rawlings were 15 percent, 14 percent
and 13 percent of net revenues of Rawlings for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
NOTE 17. QUARTERLY RESULTS UNAUDITED

c Compliance with Section 16a of the Exchange Act
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act, requires the Company directors and executive officers, and
persons who own more than 10% of the Company outstanding Common Stock, to file
with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and
reports of changes in ownership in the Company Common Stock and other equity
securities. In addition, under Section 16a, a director, executive officer or
10% stockholder who is a trustee and has a pecuniary interest such interest
includes situations where a member of the trustee immediate family is a
beneficiary of the trust in any holding or transaction in the Company
securities held by the trust, must report the holding or transaction on the
trustee individual form. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations
require directors, executive officers, greater than 10% stockholders and
reporting trusts to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16a reports
they file.
Except as described below, to the Company knowledge, based solely on
a review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written
representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2000, all Section 16a filing requirements applicable to the
directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders were met.

Michael McDonnell, Stephen M. O'Hara, Robert S. Prather, Jr. and William C.
Robinson, directors of the Company.
