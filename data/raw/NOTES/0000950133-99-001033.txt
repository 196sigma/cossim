1 DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS
LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries also referred to herein as the
Company is a leading provider of integrated services relating to the design,
engineering and build-out of wireless communications systems. The Company
businesses are as follows:
Services
Engineering and design services -- The Company provides engineering and
design services for cellular phone system operators, personal communication
system PCS operators and other wireless communication system providers.
Program management services -- The Company provides program and
construction management services related to the build-out of wireless
communications systems.
Towers
Tower ownership and management -- The Company acquires, builds, owns and
manages multi-tenant telecommunications towers and leases space thereon to
wireless communication carriers.
The Company operates in a highly competitive environment subject to rapid
technological change and emergence of new technologies. Future revenues are
dependent upon significant additional financing to pursue tower construction and
acquisitions, the successful implementation of a tower expansion strategy, the
re-engineering of existing wireless communications systems, introduction of
existing wireless technologies into new markets, the entrance of new wireless
providers into existing markets, the introduction of new technologies and the
retention of existing management and professional staff. Although the Company
believes that its services are transferable to emerging technologies, rapid
changes in technology could have an adverse financial impact on the Company.
2 MERGER AND INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
The Company is the successor to the business formerly conducted by LCC,
L.L.C. LCC. Effective September 27, 1996, in connection with the Company
initial public offering of Class A Common Stock, LCC merged with and into LCC
International, Inc. The Company is the surviving company in the merger, and owns
all of the assets and rights and is subject to all of the obligations and
liabilities of LCC. Immediately prior to the merger, LCC assumed $300 million
of convertible subordinated debt from Telcom Ventures, L.L.C. Telcom
Ventures, its parent company. The repayment obligation for principal and
interest became the sole obligation of LCC and, following the merger, the sole
obligation of the Company. The $300 million of convertible subordinated debt
assumed from Telcom Ventures and the $200 million of existing convertible
subordinated debt see note 14 are due to MCI Telecommunications Corporation
and are convertible at certain specified times, including during the 45 day
period commencing on June 27, 1999 Investor Conversion Right, the 45 day
period commencing on August 27, 1999 Company Conversion Right and upon
certain extraordinary events, such as merger or sale of all assets of the
Company, tender offer for more than 25% of the Common Stock or distribution of
assets representing 5% or more of the total assets of the Company. Any
conversion of one note must include the conversion of the other. The Company is
considering exercising the Company Conversion Right in August 1999 to cause the
convertible subordinated debt to be converted into 2,841,099 shares of Class A
Common Stock. This could result in a significant taxable gain to the Company.
Effective with the merger, the Company converted to a Subchapter C
Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of September
30, 1996, the Company recorded a one-time deferred income tax benefit of $87
million as a result of the change in its tax status from a limited liability

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

company to a Subchapter C Corporation. The income tax benefit was recorded as a
reduction of income tax expense in the accompanying 1996 consolidated statement
of operations see note 11.
On September 30, 1996, the Company completed its initial public offering,
which involved the sale of 6,037,500 shares 3,162,500 shares were sold by the
Company and 2,875,000 shares were sold by the selling shareholder of Class A
Common Stock at $1600 per share. Net proceeds to the Company, after deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses of the offering were
approximately $448 million.
3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments purchased with
original maturities of three months or less.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments consist primarily of municipal bonds with maturity
dates of more than three months from the date of acquisition. The portfolio of
municipal bonds held by the Company has been classified based on management
intentions as to future investment activity. Such investments are not intended
to be held to maturity and are classified as available for sale and carried at
market value with temporary unrealized gains losses charged directly to
shareholders' equity. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the market value of the
municipal bonds held by the Company approximated its cost. Other short-term
investments are carried at cost plus accrued interest which approximates their
market value. All short-term investments have maturity dates of one year or
less.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables. The Company sells its
services globally. Generally, the Company does not require collateral or other
security to support customer receivables. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for
potential credit losses. The Company had the following significant
concentrations of trade receivables from customers located outside the United
States at December 31, 1997 and 1998:

The Company existing and potential customer base is diverse and includes
start-up companies and foreign enterprises. Although the Company believes that
the diversity of its customer base has historically minimized the risk of
incurring material losses due to concentrations of credit risk, it may be
exposed to a declining customer base in periods of market downturns, severe
competition, exchange rate fluctuations or other international developments see
notes 8 and 19.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
During December 1997, the Company increased its allowance for doubtful
accounts due to the continued aging of receivables from its Asia-Pacific
customers. The economic downturn and exchange rate fluctuations in the
Asia-Pacific region during the latter part of calendar 1997 has resulted in
certain of the Company customers experiencing difficulty in arranging in a
timely fashion needed additional financing and hard currency to satisfy U.S.
dollar denominated liabilities to the Company. As a result of the uncertainty
associated with the collection of amounts due, in 1997 the Company recorded
additional reserves of approximately $15 million to cover potential
Asia-Pacific region exposure.
Revenues generated from one customer were approximately $129 million 160 million, and $150 million, or 138%, 175%, and 172% of total revenues
for 1996, 1997 and 1998 respectively. In addition, revenues from another
customer were approximately $119 million and $154 million, or 128% and 168%
of total 1996 and 1997 revenues, respectively. Revenues from another customer
were approximately $139 million or 159% of revenues in 1998.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less an allowance for
depreciation. Replacements and major improvements are capitalized; maintenance
and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Furniture and equipment are
depreciated over useful lives which range from eighteen months to seven years.
RF transmission towers are depreciated over a useful life of 25 years. The costs
of leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line
method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the
respective leases.
Recovery of Long-Lived Assets
The Company policy is to review its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when
the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying
amount of the asset.
Investments in Joint Ventures
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in,
advances to and equity in the earnings and losses of its joint ventures.
Revenue Recognition
The Company principal sources of revenues are engineering and design
services, program management services, and lease revenues from its asset
management business. The Company recognizes revenues from long-term fixed price
contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, based on individual
contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs.
Anticipated contract losses are recognized as soon as they become known and
estimable. Lease revenues from the ownership and management of RF transmission
towers are recognized over the term of the related lease. Revenues earned but
not yet billed are reflected as unbilled receivables in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The Company expects substantially all unbilled and
billed receivables to be collected within one year.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109. Under this statement, temporary
differences arise as a result of the differences between
53
54
LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the
effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
Certain of the Company international operations are subject to local
income taxation. Currently, the Company is subject to taxation on income from
certain operations in Europe, Latin America, the Far East, the Middle East and
the non-U.S. portions of North America where the Company has subsidiaries, has
established branch offices or has performed significant services that constitute
a permanent establishment for tax reporting purposes. Foreign taxes account
for a significant portion of the provision for income taxes as reflected in the
Company consolidated statements of operations see note 11. The foreign taxes
paid or accrued by the Company represent a potential credit for the Company
against its Federal income taxes.
Pro Forma Income Loss Data Unaudited
The accompanying pro forma information has been prepared as if the Company
was treated as a Subchapter C Corporation for Federal and state income tax
purposes from January 1, 1995.
Pro forma net income loss per share information has been computed by
dividing pro forma net income loss by the pro forma weighted average number of
common shares outstanding basic earnings per share and potential dilution from
outstanding stock options after applying the treasury stock method and assumed
conversion of the Company convertible subordinated debt, if dilutive diluted
earnings per share.
Foreign Currency Translation
Gains and losses on translation of the accounts of the Company foreign
operations where the local currency is the functional currency are accumulated
and included in other comprehensive loss within the accompanying consolidated
statement of shareholders' equity deficit. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are recognized currently in the consolidated statements of
operations.
Pervasiveness of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which establishes
financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based compensation plans.
This statement establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock
based compensation plans.
The Corporation will continue to account for stock-based compensation plans
using the method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. The Corporation will make pro-forma disclosures of
net income as if the fair value based method of accounting as defined in SFAS
No. 123 had been applied see note 15.

Other Comprehensive Income Loss
During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which established standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive
income and its components in a financial statement that is displayed in equal
prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as net
income plus the changes in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Other
comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under
generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income,
but excluded from net income. Other comprehensive income lossconsists solely
of foreign currency translation adjustments in 1996, 1997 and 1998. Changes in
components of other comprehensive income loss are reported net of income tax,

4 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In March 1999, the Company Board of Directors adopted a plan to
discontinue the operations comprising its software and hardware products
segments. Software products develops software and data which support the design
and operation of wireless communication systems. Hardware products are used in
the implementation, testing and maintenance of wireless communications systems.
The Company has engaged an investment banking firm to assist in the marketing
and sale of these segments. The sale of the product segments are expected to be
completed during 1999. The Company currently anticipates that any gain on the
sale of the product segments would be sufficient to offset operating losses of
such segments to the date of sale, though there can be no assurance that this
will be the case.
Revenue from the Products businesses were $484 million, $640 million and
$338 million for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997, and 1998,
respectively. Net income loss was $04 million, $22 million, and $178
million for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.

During 1996, 1997, and 1998 the Company provided services to Telcom
Ventures and various other companies owned, in part, by Telcom Ventures or its
members, as well as the Telemate joint venture until its sale in January 1996
see note 10. Revenues earned during 1996, 1997 and 1998 for services provided
to these customers were approximately $20 million, $11 million and $750,000,
respectively. Receivables from these related parties were $524,000 and $119,000
at December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively, and are included in due from
related parties and affiliates in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

During 1997 and 1998 the Company made certain payments on behalf of Telcom
Ventures and its members which consisted primarily of payroll services, fringe
benefit payments, facility related charges, business insurances, interest and
foreign tax payments. At December 31, 1997 and 1998, outstanding amounts
associated with these payments totaling $30,000 and $111,000, respectively, are
included in due from related parties and affiliates within the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.
In September 1996, the Company loaned $35 million to Telcom Ventures to
assist in the payment of taxes due in connection with the assumption by the
Company of $300 million of convertible subordinated debt from Telcom Ventures
see note 2. The note is payable over five-years with equal annual principal
payments over the term. Interest will accrue at the rate of LIBOR plus 175% and
will be payable annually. In November 1997 and October 1998, the Company
received payments of approximately $10 million from Telcom Ventures
representing payment of $07 million principal and approximately $03 million
interest under the terms of the note. The note is reflected as a reduction of
shareholders' equity in the accompanying statement of shareholders' equity
deficit.
On January 30, 1997, a significant customer of the Company acquired 81% of
the outstanding shares of Wireless Ventures of Brazil, Inc. WVB, an operator

8 SPECIAL CHARGE
In March 1996, the Company made investments in Pocket Communications, Inc.
Pocket, formerly known as DCR Communications, Inc. and NextWave Telecom,
Inc. NextWave of $65 million and $50 million, respectively. The $65
million investment in Pocket consists of loans convertible into shares of
non-voting common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. In
connection with this investment, the Company obtained a commitment from Pocket
for the purchase of services and products aggregating $650 million over the
subsequent five-year period. The $50 million investment in NextWave consists of
an equity investment. In connection with this investment, the Company obtained a
commitment from NextWave for the purchase of services and products aggregating
$500 million over the subsequent five-year period. Through December 31, 1996,
revenues recognized under the commitments with Pocket and NextWave were
approximately $22 million and $113 million, respectively, and related amounts
receivable were approximately $22 million and $96 million, respectively.
Included in the amounts receivable are notes receivable from Pocket and NextWave
of approximately $950,000 and $59 million, respectively. The notes bear
interest at

prime plus 2%, and were payable upon maturity of the notes on March 31, 1997.
Both customers were development stage enterprises pursuing the buildout and
operation of networks pursuant to licenses obtained in the auction of C-Block
licenses by the FCC and subject to risks typically associated with start-up
entities, such as i the uncertainty of securing sufficient financing, ii
competition from other providers of telecommunications services, iii
dependence on key vendors and strategic partners, and iv delays encountered in
the development and successful operation of their PCS networks.
On March 31, 1997, Pocket failed to pay interest due the Company under the
$65 million convertible loan agreement and failed to pay principal and interest
due the Company under the $950,000 note agreement. Also on March 31, 1997,
NextWave failed to pay principal and interest due under the $59 million note
agreement. In addition, on April 1, 1997, Pocket announced that it had
voluntarily sought court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. Given these developments and the uncertainty related to Pocket and
NextWave ability to meet their future obligations under the agreements
outlined above, the Company fully reserved its exposure with these customers and
consequently recorded a special charge of $289 million pre-tax $238 million
after tax or $195 per share at December 31, 1996. The $289 million special
charge consisted of a reserve against the Company aggregate receivable
exposure at December 31, 1996 of $121 million net of payments of $04 million
received in January 1997, the recognition of an other than temporary impairment
of the Company investments of $115 million and accruals of approximately $53
million related to loss contracts under which the Company was obligated to
perform at December 31, 1996.
On April 15, 1997, the Company and NextWave agreed to a revised payment
schedule for amounts outstanding under the note receivable and other receivables
due from NextWave to the Company. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
was to receive approximately $10 million per month from May 15, 1997 through
May 15, 1998. In addition, under certain circumstances, in the event of the sale
or issuance of any debt or equity instruments/securities or the sale of any
assets by NextWave, the Company would be entitled to a prepayment equal to 30%
of the gross proceeds from such transactions. In May and June 1997, the
Company agreed to defer NextWave obligations to prepay the foregoing
obligations out of the proceeds of NextWave debt or equity financing to August
20, 1997. Payments of $20 million were received under the revised payment
schedule through June 30, 1997. NextWave failed to make the $10 million monthly
payments which were due July 15, 1997 through October 15, 1997, as well as any
payment that would have been due on August 20, 1997 related to any debt or
equity financing.
During September 1997, the Company recognized an approximate $39 million
recovery of the $289 million special charge. Of the $39 million, $20 million
represents the payments received through June 1997 under the revised payment
schedule and $19 million represents additional payments received in April 1997
from NextWave, net of related expenses. For financial reporting purposes, the
recovery of the $39 million balance was deferred pending the lapse in the third
quarter of a 90 day window during which such funds could have been subject to
being treated as preference payments recoverable by NextWave had it filed for
protection under the bankruptcy laws. During calendar 1998, NextWave also sought
court protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
9 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
On October 20, 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan that resulted in a total fourth quarter charge of
approximately $25 million, including approximately $12 million related to
continuing operations. The restructuring charge included $01 million related to
Company Services businesses, $11 million related to corporate general and
administrative expenses and $13 million related to the Company products
businesses. The charge was taken to cover the one-time costs associated with the
closure of the Company office in Dusseldorf, Germany, a reduction in
non-billable positions of approximately

31, 1998, a total liability of $14 million remained, including approximately
$10 million related to continuing operations. The $10 million is included in
other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated 1998 balance sheet.
10 INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES
The Company investment in joint ventures at December 31, 1997 consisted
of a 33 1/3 percent interest in Koll, which was formed in October 1994 with two
other unrelated entities. Koll provides site acquisition and construction
management services to operators of wireless communications systems in the
United States. The Company interest in Koll was received in exchange for an
initial cash investment of $150,000. During 1996 the Company contributed an
additional $587,000. No contribution was made by the Company during 1997.
Operating costs and expenses of the Company include services provided by Koll,
in the amount of $37,000 in 1997.

interest in Koll bringing its total membership interest to 1000%. Prior to the
acquisition, the Company owned 333% of the membership interest, Castle Rock
Telecommunications Co., LLC CRT held approximately 367% of the membership
interest, and Koll Management Services, Inc. KMS, held the remaining 300%. In
the transaction, Koll redeemed the ownership interests of KMS in exchange for
KMS assumption of certain contract rights and associated assets and
liabilities. Koll also redeemed the membership interests of CRT in exchange for
an earn-out agreement entitling CRT to 400% of the pre-tax income, after
certain adjustments, derived by Koll from certain contracts with specified
customers.
The Company had a 50% interest in Telemate S.A. Telemate, which
provides consulting services in connection with the implementation and operation
of mobile communications systems in certain countries in Europe, Asia and Latin
America. The Company provided design engineering services and software products
to Telemate. Revenues earned related to these services were approximately $18
million in 1995. In January 1996, the Company sold its 50% interest in Telemate
and granted certain distribution rights for the Company software and hardware
products for $38 million. Approximately $14 million of the proceeds were
received for the Company investment in Telemate, resulting in a gain of
approximately $514,000, which was recognized by the Company and included in
other income in its calendar 1996 first quarter results. The remaining proceeds
of $24 million were recorded as deferred revenue and were amortized to other
income over the 24 month life of the distribution agreement.

During 1996, the Company entered into master service, convertible note and
stock option agreements with Communication Consulting Services, Inc. CCS, a
provider of radio frequency engineering services in connection with the design,
optimization and operation of wireless systems. Under the master service
agreement, CCS provided the Company with radio frequency engineers effective
November 1, 1996. Under the convertible note agreement, the Company loaned CCS a
total of approximately $602,000 which, at December 31, 1996, was included in
long-term notes receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Interest accrued on the loan at a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus
15%. Interest was payable in arrears on the last day each of March 1997, June
1997, September 1997, and December 1997. The entire principal balance, together
with any unpaid interest, was due January 2, 1998. The loan was convertible, at
the Company option, into shares representing 50% of the authorized capital
stock and/or equity securities of CCS. The stock option agreement gives the
Company an option to purchase an additional 10% of the common stock of CCS for a
total purchase price of $150,000. On April 7, 1997, the Company exercised both
the conversion right in the convertible note and the 10% purchase right set
forth in the stock option agreement.
On September 30, 1998, the Company sold its interest in CCS to CCS
Management for $12 million. The $12 million is payable in two installments
consisting of i $600,000 due on May 31, 1999 and ii $600,000 due on November
30, 1999. Interest, equal to 9%, is due monthly on the first day of each month,
beginning January 1, 1999. The initial interest payment is for the period from
October 1, 1998 to January 1, 1999. As of December 31, 1998, the Company has
recorded a reserve of approximately $557,000 related to the transaction.

At December 31, 1998, the Company had $214 million of U.S. Federal and
state operating loss carryforwards from continuing operations which expire
between 2011 and 2018 and foreign tax credits for U.S. tax purposes of $36
million which expire between 2001 and 2003.
The Company also had $49 million of foreign operating loss carryforwards
from discontinued operations which expire between 2006 and 2008.
In addressing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. A
valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets which management
believes are not more likely than not to be realized.
Effective September 27, 1996, the Company converted to a Subchapter C
Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended IRC. As a
result, the Company recorded a one-time deferred income tax benefit from
continuing operations of $75 million total of $87 million due to the change
in tax status. The benefit is reflected in net income from continuing operations
for the year ended December 31, 1996 as a reduction of the provision for income
taxes. In conjunction with the acquisition of the assets of ETP, the Company
recorded a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $16 million as a result
of the allocation of approximately $56 million of the purchase price to
in-process research and development expenses. The benefit is recorded as a
reduction of the net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 1996. Also, as a result of the reserves recorded related to the
Company receivables from, investments in and contract costs associated with
Pocket and NextWave, the Company recorded a deferred income tax benefit of $51
million and a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $04 million, net of a
valuation allowance of $58 million see note 9. The net benefit of $51
million is recorded as a reduction of the provision for income taxes from
continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 1996. Prior to September
27, 1996, the Company was a Limited Liability Company and was not directly
subject to U.S. Federal income taxes and certain state income taxes. Rather, the
members were responsible for Federal income taxes and certain state income taxes
on their proportionate share of taxable income. U.S. state and local income tax
expense was generated from activities conducted in the several states that did
not recognize the limited liability company as a flow-through entity and,
therefore, required the Company to be taxed as if it were a corporation.
Foreign income tax expense is generated from business conducted in
countries where the Company has subsidiaries or has established branch offices
or has performed significant services that constitute a permanent
establishment for tax reporting purposes.
The unaudited pro forma provisionbenefit for income taxes presented in
the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 1996,
represents an estimate of the taxes that would have been recorded had the
Company been a Subchapter C corporation as of January 1, 1996. The unaudited pro
forma benefit for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996 consists

unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Telcom Ventures under the Telcom

14 HEALTH AND RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under Section
401k of the IRC that provides for voluntary employee contributions of 10 to
150 percent of compensation for substantially all employees. The Company makes
a matching contribution of 500 percent of an employee contribution up to 60
percent of each employee compensation. Company contributions and other
expenses associated with the plan were approximately $317,000, $444,000 and
$652,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.

15 INCENTIVE PLANS
At December 31, 1996, 1997, and 1998 the Company had two stock-based
incentive plans, an employee stock purchase plan and an employee stock option
plan, which are described below. The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans and
employee stock purchase plan. Had compensation cost for the Company
stock-based compensation plans and employee stock purchase plan been determined
on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123 SFAS No. 123,
the Company income loss from continuing operations and income loss from
continuing operations per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts
indicated below.

Income loss from continuing operations reflects only options granted in
1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998. Therefore, the full impact of calculating
compensation cost for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the
pro forma net income loss amounts presented above as compensation cost is
reflected over the options' vesting period of up to five-years and compensation
cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not considered.
The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during
1996, 1997 and 1998 was $425, $841 and $1002, respectively, on the date of
grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following

Under the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 360,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock were available for purchase by eligible employees of the Company
beginning in 1997. Rights to purchase shares are deemed granted to participating
employees as of the beginning of each applicable period, as specified by the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Company Board of Directors. The
purchase price for each share is not less than 85% of the fair market value of
the share of Class A Common Stock on the first or last trading day of such
period, whichever is lower. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company
sold 65,448 shares to employees in 1997 and 100,710 shares in 1998. Compensation
cost of $161,000 and $175,000, respectively, would have been recognized under
SFAS No. 123 for the fair value of the employees purchase rights and is included
in proforma net income above for 1997. Compensation cost was estimated using the
Black Scholes model with the following assumptions.

In April 1994, the Company adopted the Phantom Membership Plan the
Phantom Membership Plan. Under the Phantom Membership Plan, the Members
Committee was authorized to grant awards Phantom Membership Awards to those
employees of the Company whose responsibilities and decisions, in the Members
Committee opinion, affect the long-term sustained growth and profitability of
the Company. Each Phantom Membership Award entitled the recipient thereof to
receive, no later than May 1 of each year, an annual award based on a specified
percentage of the Company net income for the preceding fiscal year. The
Phantom Membership Plan also included a long-term award. Under the long-term
award, once a Phantom Membership Award was fully vested, the recipient had the
right to require the Company to purchase, and the Company had the right to
require such recipient to sell, all or any portion of the recipient Phantom
Membership Award based on the fair market value of the Company as defined under
the Phantom Membership Plan. In connection with the Company initial public
offering, all long-term awards granted under the Phantom Membership Plan were
replaced with options granted under the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan and the
annual award feature of the Phantom Membership Plan was terminated. The options
vest

over the original vesting period of the Phantom Membership Plan awards,
generally ratably over, or at the end of, 3 or 5 years.
Compensation expense related to the annual award feature of the Phantom
Membership Plan was $764,000 for 1996. Non-cash compensation related to the
long-term award feature of the Phantom Membership Plan, including compensation
expense for membership awards converted to stock options under the 1996 Employee
Stock Option Plan, was $68 million, $05 million, and $04 million for 1996,
1997, and 1998, respectively, the liability for which was included in paid-in
capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
In March 1996, LCC adopted an Employee Stock Option Plan for certain key
executives under which the Members' Committee granted options for up to an
aggregate six percent interest in the Company. Options representing
approximately a 60% interest were outstanding as of March 15, 1996. The Options
were granted at an exercise price equal to fair market value at time of grant,
and generally became exercisable at 20% a year over a five-year period.
Unexercised options generally expire 10 years after issuance.
In connection with its initial public offering, the Company established the
1996 Employee Stock Option Plan, which authorized the issuance of up to
3,224,000 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to options granted under the
plan. An additional 1,501,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved under
the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan in 1998. Options to purchase approximately
580,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at the offering price of $16 were
granted, at the time of the Offering to approximately 260 employees of the
Company under the Company 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan. The options vest
with respect to one-third of the shares subject to option on each of the first
three anniversaries of the date of grant. Unexercised options generally expire
10 years after issuance. In addition, at the time of the Offering options to
purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 2,160,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock were issued under the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan to certain employees
of the Company to replace the options granted by LCC in connection with the
Employee Stock Option Plan see above and the Phantom Membership Awards under
the LCC Membership Plan adopted in 1994 see above. The exercise price and
number of options granted were intended to maintain a comparable value with the
options/awards under the previous plans.
Also in connection with the Company initial public offering, the Company
established the 1996 Director Stock Option Plan. The Director Plan provides
for the formula grant of options, and authorizes the issuance of up to 60,000
shares of Class A Common Stock and 250,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. An
additional 80,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved under the
Director Plan in 1998. The option exercise price for options granted under the
Director Plan is 100% of the fair value of the shares on the date of grant.
Each eligible director who is not eligible to hold shares of Class B Common
Stock was granted an initial option to purchase 10,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock in connection with the offering. Each eligible director who is eligible to
hold shares of Class B Common Stock and who was a director as of the offering
was granted an initial option to purchase 35,000 shares of Class B Common Stock
in connection with the offering, and will be granted additional options to
purchase 22,500 shares of Class B Common Stock as of each of the next four
annual meetings of the stockholders of the Company if the director continues to
be an eligible director. Options granted with respect to Class A Common Stock
will become immediately exercisable with respect to directors who were directors
of the Company prior to July 1, 1996, and will become exercisable with respect
to one-third of the shares of Class A Common Stock that are subject to the
options on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant subject to
acceleration of vesting on a change of control with respect to directors who
became directors of the Company after July 1, 1996.
The Company has reserved 85,000 shares of Class A Common Stock for issuance
pursuant to options to be granted to a person or entity designated by The
Carlyle Group. The option exercise price for these options are and will be 100%
of the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock on the date of grant of the
option. An initial option to purchase 25,000 shares of Class A Common Stock was
granted in connection with the

shares of Class A Common Stock on each of the next four anniversaries of the
initial date of grant. Options granted will vest immediately. The options will
expire no later than the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
On December 11, 1998, the Company re-priced substantially all options
previously granted under the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan to $500 per share
which exceeded the fair market value of the stock on that date. Approximately
887,000 share options were subject to re-pricing.

16 LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company leases office facilities and certain equipment, principally in
the United States, under operating leases expiring on various dates over the
next ten years. The lease agreements include renewal options and provisions for
rental escalations based on the Consumer Price Index and require the Company to
pay for executory costs such as taxes and insurance. The lease agreements also
allow the Company to elect an early out provision by giving notice and paying
certain lease termination penalties.
Benefits associated with a rent abatement period and certain lease
incentives for office facilities are reflected ratably over the period of the
lease. For leases which have been terminated see below, the applicable portion
of the benefit has been offset against the lease termination penalty. The total
deferred rent benefit was approximately $289,000 and $763,000 at December 31,
1997 and 1998, respectively.
In November 1995 and December 1996, the Company gave notice of early lease
termination to two of its landlords and recorded the lease termination penalties
thereon in its calendar 1995 and 1996 financial statements. In May 1996, the
Company entered into 10-year and 5-year facility lease agreements effective
March 1, 1997 and July 1, 1997, respectively.
Future minimum rental payments and receivables under non-cancelable
operating leases, excluding executory costs, are as follows:

Microcell itself, seeking rescission of the shareholders' agreement between the
Company and the minority shareholders which concerns management of Microcell,
funding commitments and other matters, the appointment of a custodian or
receiver and unspecified monetary damages. On February 16, 1999, the plaintiffs
filed a motion to expedite and a motion for appointment of a receiver or
custodian. The suit alleges breach of a fiduciary duty, usurpation of corporate
opportunities, and waste of Microcell corporate assets, tortious interference
with Microcell prospective business relations, and violations of the
shareholders' agreement. Microcell and the Company have filed a motion to
dismiss. The Company believes that the case is without merit and intends to
contest this action vigorously.
The Company is party to various other legal proceedings and claims incidental to
their business. Management does not believe that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial
condition of the Company.
18 EARNINGS PER SHARE
During 1997 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS No. 128. SFAS No. 128
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15, Earnings per Share and
its related interpretations and promulgates new accounting standards for the
computation and manner of presentation of the Company earnings per share data.
Under SFAS No. 128 the Company is required to present basic and diluted earnings
per share. Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by
dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in
the issuance of common stock that shared in the earnings of the Company. The
reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 are as follows:

19 SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, during the fourth quarter of 1998. SFAS No.
131 established standards for reporting information about the operating segments
in interim and annual financial reports issued to stockholders. It also
established standards for related disclosures about products and services and
geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in
deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company chief
operating decision making group is the Executive Committee which is comprised of
the Chief Operating Officer and the lead executive of each of the Company
operating segments. The operating segments are managed separately because each
operating segment represents a strategic business unit that offers distinct
services.
The Company operating segments include Services Engineering and Design
Services and Program Management Services and Tower ownership and management.
Engineering and Design Services provides engineering and design services for
cellular phone system operators, personal communication system PCS operators
and other wireless communication systems providers. Program Management Services
provides program and construction management services related to the build-out
of wireless communication systems. Tower ownership and management acquires,
builds, owns and manages telecommunications towers.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company
evaluates performance based on stand alone operating segment profit or loss from
operations before income taxes not including nonrecurring gains and losses, and
generally accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or
transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.
Interdivisional transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Revenues are
attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the assignment. Assets
and expenditures for property were not allocated to individual segments in 1996
as the Company did not separately account for and report segment assets until
1997. In addition, segment assets are not allocated between the Engineering and
Design and Program Management segments. All assets related to these two segments
are included as part of the Engineering and Design segment in the tables below.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998
The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, the note payable as of December 31,
1997 and accounts payable approximated fair value as of December 31, 1997 and
1998 because of the relatively short duration of these instruments.
Convertible subordinated debt -- the fair value at December 31, 1997 and
1998 is based on the fair market value of the Class A Common Stock assuming
conversion into 2,841,099 shares.
Notes receivable from shareholder -- the carrying value of the note
receivable approximated the fair value as the receivable is treated as a deemed
dividend.
Letters of credit -- the fair value of letters of credit was estimated
based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or the estimated cost to
terminate or settle the obligations.
Financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the Company to
guarantee the payment of certain liabilities of unconsolidated affiliates. No
such guarantees were outstanding at December 31, 1997 or 1998.
22 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
From January 1, 1999 to March 29, 1999 the Company borrowed a total of $34
million under its Credit Facility with Chase.
In January 1999, the Company entered into a $50 million convertible
promissory note with Telcom Ventures. Under the terms of the note, the entire
principal balance and accrued interest thereon at a rate of 90 percent is due
on April 30, 2000 or upon the occurrence of certain events such as the sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. At anytime from August 1,
1999 either Telcom Ventures or the Company may convert the then outstanding
principal and accrued, but unpaid interest into shares of the Company Class A
Common Stock based on a conversion price of $622 per share, subject to
adjustment for stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar events.
During the two month period ended February 28, 1999, the Company recognized
total foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $21 million related
to its 1998 Latin American operations. The majority of the losses were from the
Company Brazilian operations as a result of the devaluation of the Real in
1999.
Telcom Ventures has assured the Company that it intends to provide the
Company with funding to cover any cash shortfalls the Company may have during
1999 in an amount not to exceed $125 million less the sum of amounts drawn
under the Credit Facility in excess of $10 million plus amounts received through
additional financings or the sale of the Products Businesses. These assurances
are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the parties
reaching agreement on applicable financing documents, and will apply only as
long as Telcom Ventures directly or indirectly owns at least 40% of the
Company outstanding common stock, other than any stock issued to MCI upon
conversion of the MCI notes.
