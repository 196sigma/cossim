29 Table of Contents   REPORTS
OF MANAGEMENT   Managements
Responsibility for Financial Statements   Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
the consolidated financial statements and related information.
The statements are prepared in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied and include certain amounts based on managements
best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
financial statements.   In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
financial information, management maintains a system of internal
accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
division of responsibility and the application of written
policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
preparation of reliable financial data.   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
of internal controls, although there are inherent limitations in
the effectiveness of any system of internal controls that is
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and
reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated
financial statements.   Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Companys activities according to the highest standards of
personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
of the Company for its 2006 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
direct access to the Audit Committee.   The Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst Young LLP, is engaged to render an
opinion as to whether managements financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys
financial position and operating results. That report appears on
page 32.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005 based on the
framework in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2005.   Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears on page31.   AMETEK, Inc.   March1, 2006   
30 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting which appears on page 30, that
AMETEK, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO criteria. AMETEK, Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that AMETEK, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005, and our report dated March1, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ERNST

31 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
AMETEK, Inc. as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
stockholders equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2005. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December31, 2005 and
2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of AMETEK, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated March1, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.   /s/ERNST

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1.
Significant
Accounting Policies   Basis of
Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
the Company, and include the accounts of the
Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant
intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The
Companys investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures
are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such
investments are not significant to the Companys
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash
flows.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Cash
Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments   All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, all of the Companys
equity securities and fixed-income securities primarily those
of a captive insurance subsidiary are classified as
available for sale, although the Company may hold
fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate
market value of equity and fixed-income securities at
December31, 2005 and 2004 was $157million
$152million amortized cost, and $187million
$168million amortized cost, respectively. The temporary
unrealized gain or loss on such securities is recorded as a
separate component of other comprehensive income in
stockholders equity, and is not material. The Company had
no
other-than-temporary
impairment losses in 2005 or 2004. The Company recognized
other-than-temporary
impairment losses against earnings of $07million in 2003.
Certain of the Companys other investments are accounted
for by the equity method, and as discussed previously, are not
significant.   Accounts
Receivable   The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
specific receivables are past due based on its past experience.
The allowance for possible losses on receivables at
December31, 2005 and 2004 was $76million. See
Note6.   Inventories   The Company uses the
last-in,
first-out LIFO method of accounting for approximately 50% of
its inventories. The
first-in,
first-out FIFO method, which approximates current replacement
cost, is used to determine cost for the remaining 50% of the
inventories. For inventories where cost is determined by the
LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO value over the LIFO value
was approximately $284million and $288million at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company
provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and
obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future
demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing
financial difficulties, and related management initiatives. If
these factors are less favorable than those projected by
management, additional inventory reserves may be required.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable
assets is generally 5 to 10years for machinery and
equipment, and 25 to 40years for buildings.   Revenue
Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
been transferred, collectibility is reasonably assured and
pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all
other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy with
respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that
the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
except at the Companys option. We have agreements with
distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for
unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the
Company at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the
distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a
reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income
statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances, and
estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment
based upon past experience. At December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was
$94million, $73million and $69million,
respectively. The Companys expense for warranty
obligations approximated $72million in 2005 and
$50million each year in 2004 and 2003. The warranty
periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys
operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The
Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past
warranty experience, and adjustments are made periodically to
reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales
returns, allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past
experience, additional warranty accruals may be required.   Research
and Development   Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred and during the past three years were:
2005-$348million, 2004-$255million and
2003-$214million.   Shipping

Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation   Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and
their results of operations are translated using average
exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company
and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other than their
functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those
transactions generally are included in operating results for the
year.   The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into
from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain
inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the
Companys exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. No
forward contracts were outstanding at December31, 2005.
One insignificant forward contract for the purchase of certain
inventories was outstanding at December31, 2004. In
instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an
underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are
included in Other Comprehensive Income OCI within
stockholders equity to the extent they are effective as
hedges. The Company has designated certain
foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of the net
investment in certain foreign operations. These net investment
hedges relate to the Companys British-pound-denominated
long-term debt and euro-denominated long-term debt pertaining to
the Companys acquisition of Solartron in September 2005,
Taylor Hobson in June 2004, and Airtechnology in January 2003,
which are U.K.-based businesses, and the SPECTRO business,
which was acquired in June 2005, and is a German-based business.
These acquisitions were financed by borrowings under
AMETEKs revolving credit facility and subsequently
refinanced in the form of long-term debt outside of the
revolving credit facility. These borrowings were designed to
create natural net investment hedges in each of the foreign
subsidiaries mentioned on their respective dates of acquisition.
SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, permits hedging the foreign currency
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. In
accordance with SFAS133, on the respective dates of
acquisition, the Company designated the British pound- and
euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments
to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment
in the acquired business due to changes in the British pound and
euro exchange rates. As required by SFAS133, any gain or
loss on the hedging instrument following hedge designation the
debt, is reported in OCI in the same manner as the translation
adjustment on the investment based on changes in the spot rate,
which is used to measure hedge effectiveness. As of
December31, 2005 and 2004, all net investment hedges were
effective. At December31, 2005, the translation gains on
the net carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated
investments exceeded the translation losses on the carrying
value of the underlying debt and are included in OCI. An
evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company on
an ongoing basis.   At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had
$1918million and $1727million, respectively, of
British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge
against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in
2005, 2004 and 2003. At December31, 2005, the Company had
$592million of euro-denominated loans, which were
designated as a hedge against the net investment in a foreign
subsidiary acquired in 2005. As a result of these British pound-
and euro-denominated loans being designated and effective as net
investment hedges, approximately $205million of currency
gains and $101million of currency losses have been
included in the translation adjustment in OCI at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   Stock-Based
Compensation   SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and SFASNo148, Accounting for
Stock-Based CompensationTransition and
Disclosures, which amends SFAS123, encourage entities
to recognize compensation expense for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value, but provide the option of
measuring compensation expense using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB25.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
with APB25. The exercise price of stock options, set at
the time of the grant, is not less than the fair market value
per share at the date of the grant. Had the Company applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123, pretax
stock-based compensation expense would have increased
$59million, $51million, and

presents pro forma results of operations as if the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS123 had been used to account
for stock-based compensation plans.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with SFASNo142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFAS142, purchased
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives,
primarily trademarks and tradenames, are not amortized; rather,
they are tested for impairment at least annually.   Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Patents are
being amortized over useful lives of 5 to 17years.
Customer relationships are being amortized over a period of 15
to 20years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are
being amortized over a period of 10 to 20years. The
Company periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the useful
lives of these intangible assets.   In order to test goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives for impairment under SFAS142, a
determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting
units for its goodwill valuation, and its other intangible
assets with indefinite lives is required and is based upon,
among other things, estimates of future operating performance of
the reporting unit being valued. Changes in market conditions,
among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. The
Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the
fourth quarter of 2005, 2004 and 2003 and determined that the
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives was not impaired.   Reclassifications   Certain amounts appearing in the prior years financial
statements and supporting footnote disclosures have been
reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.

requires the Company to expense the fair value of grants made
under its employee stock award plans. That cost will be
recognized over the required service period of the grants.
SFASNo123R permits companies to adopt its
requirements using either a modified prospective

The Company will adopt SFASNo123R effective
January1, 2006, under the modified retrospective method
with retroactive restatement for all prior periods presented
using the pro forma amounts disclosed in Note10 of the

SFASNo123R is expected to reduce diluted earnings
per share by approximately $005 for 2006 and $005per

such items be recognized as current-period charges.
SFASNo151 is effective for fiscal years beginning

SFASNo151 effective January1, 2006 and does
not expect that its adoption will have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated results of operations, financial
position or cash flows.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,

Acquisitions   In October 2005, the Company acquired HCC Industries
HCC from an investor group led by Windward Capital
Partners and management for approximately $162million in
cash, net of cash received. Additionally, with the acquisition
of HCC, the Company assumed specified contingent liabilities,
for which the Company believes it is fully indemnified, arising
out of certain previous business activities of HCC. HCC is a
leading designer and manufacturer of highly engineered hermetic
connectors, terminals, headers and microelectronic packages for
sophisticated electronic applications in the aerospace, defense,
industrial and petrochemical markets. Headquartered near Los
Angeles, CA, HCC has annual sales of approximately
$104million. HCC is part of the Companys
Electromechanical Group.   In September 2005, the Company acquired the Solartron Group
Solartron from Roxboro Group PLC for approximately
42million British pounds, or $75million in cash, net
of cash received. United Kingdom-based Solartron is a leading
supplier of analytical instrumentation for the process,
laboratory, and other industrial markets, with annual sales of
approximately 27million British pounds, or
$50million. Solartron is part of the Companys
Electronic Instruments Group.   In June 2005, the Company acquired SPECTRO Beteiligungs GmbH
SPECTRO, the holding company of SPECTRO Analytical
Instruments GmbH Co. KG and its affiliates, from an
investor group led by German Equity Partners BV for
approximately 80million euros, or $969million in

the Company expects to realize from the acquisitions as follows:
The HCC acquisition provides a new platform for the
Companys Electromechanical Group in the rapid design and
production of hermetic moisture-proof connectors, terminals,
headers and microelectronic packages for customer-specific
applications. The Solartron acquisition broadens the
Companys analytical instrumentation product offerings for
the process, laboratory and other industrial markets, expanding
its geographic reach and capitalizing on significant synergies
with the Companys existing businesses. The benefits the
Company expects to realize from the SPECTRO acquisition include
the expansion of its elemental analysis capabilities in metal
production and processing, environmental testing, hydrocarbon
processing, aerospace, food processing, and pharmaceutical
markets. The technology acquisitions provide additional avenues
for internal growth. The Company does not expect the majority of
the goodwill recorded on the 2005 acquisitions will be
deductible for tax purposes.   The $400million assigned to other intangible assets
consists primarily of patents and technology with estimated
lives ranging from 6 to 15years.   For the HCC, Solartron and SPECTRO acquisitions, the Company is
in the process of completing third party valuations of certain
tangible and intangible assets acquired and updating its
assessment of the acquired contingent liabilities of HCC.
Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired
assets and liabilities of these businesses is subject to
revision.   In 2004, the Company made two acquisitions.In June 2004,
the Company acquired Taylor Hobson HoldingsLimited Taylor
Hobson for approximately 510million British pounds, or

receivable under the securitization facility. The securitization
facility expires in December 2006. The Company intends to renew
the securitization facility on an annual basis. Interest rates
on amounts drawn down are based on prevailing market rates for
short-term commercial paper plus a program fee. The Company also
pays a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the
securitization facility. The Companys accounts receivable
securitization is accounted for as a secured borrowing under

17million shares at a cost of $245million at the
end of 2004. The number of shares outstanding at
December31, 2005 was 705million shares, compared
with 687million shares at December31, 2004.   The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of
one-half of a Right for each share of Company common stock owned
at the inception of the Plan. The Plan provides, under certain
conditions involving acquisition of the Companys common
stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity,
would be entitled ito purchase shares of preferred stock
at a specified exercise price, or iito purchase shares
of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having
a value of twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the
Plan expire in 2007.

Stock
Option and Award Plans   The Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant
of up to 40million shares of common stock to eligible
employees and non-employee directors of the Company in the form
of options, phantom stock awards, restricted stock awards and
stock rights. The Companys 1999 Stock Incentive Plan
permits the grant of up to 40million shares of common
stock in the same forms as under the 2002 Plan. The
Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of up
to 76million shares of common stock in the same forms as
under the 2002 Plan. Stock options may be granted as
non-qualified stock options or as incentive stock options.   In 2004, the Company adopted a change in its long-term incentive
compensation program for officers and other senior managers to
grant approximately 50% of the value of its long-term incentive
awards as restricted stock and 50% as stock options, rather than
primarily stock options as it had previously. Restricted awards
of the Companys common stock are made to eligible
employees and non-employee directors at such cost to the grantee
as the compensation committee of the Board of Directors may
determine at the date such awards are granted. Such shares are
granted subject to certain conditions with respect to transfer
and other restrictions as prescribed by the plan. Upon grant of
restricted stock, unearned compensation, equivalent to the
excess of the market price of the shares awarded over the
exercise price at the date of grant, is charged as a reduction
of capital in excess of par value in the

amortization was $47million, $11million, and
$24million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.
Restricted stock compensation expense in 2003 included
$21million in connection with the acceleration of vesting
of a restricted stock grant. There were 883,025shares and
364,945shares of restricted stock outstanding at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   Under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
SERP, in 2005, the Company reserved
13,443shares of common stock. Reductions for retirements
and terminations were minimal in 2005. The total number of
shares of common stock reserved under the SERP was 187,303 as of
December31, 2005. Charges to expense under the SERP, not
significant in amount, are considered pension expense, with the
offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par value.   At December31, 2005, 5,126,344 6,919,840 in
2004shares of common stock were reserved for issuance,

market prices on dates of grant, and in installments over
four-to ten-year periods from dates of grant. Options vest on a
straight-line basis generally over a four-year period. The
Company had no stock appreciation rights outstanding at
December31, 2005 or 2004. Stock appreciation rights, if
and when issued, are exercisable for cash

tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.   As of December31, 2005, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $216million for tax
purposes, which will be available to offset future income taxes
payable subject to certain annual or other limitations based on
U.S. and foreign tax law. This amount includes net operating
loss carryforwards of $142million for federal income tax
purposes with a valuation allowance of $58million,
$49million for foreign income tax purposes with a
valuation allowance of $03million, and $25million
for state income tax purposes with a full valuation allowance.
These net operating loss carryforwards are primarily related to
recent acquisitions, and if not used, will expire between 2007
and 2030. As of December31, 2005, the Company has foreign
tax credits of approximately $63million which will be
available to offset future income taxes payable subject to
certain limitations based on U.S. tax law. There is a full
valuation allowance on the foreign tax credits. If not used, the
credits will expire in 2014 and 2015. The Company maintains a
valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to
amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Any
reductions in the allowance resulting from the realization of
the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will result in a
reduction of goodwill.

Retirement
Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits   Retirement
and Pension Plans   The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
generally provide benefits based on participants years of
service
and/or
compensation. The following is a brief description of the
Companys retirement and pension plans.   The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
Companys funding policy with respect to its defined
benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
of U.S.federal and local foreign laws. AMETEK estimates
that it will make cash contributions of approximately
$12million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans
in 2006.   The Company uses a measurement date of December31 for its
U.S.defined benefit pension plans and an October1
measurement date for its foreign defined benefit pension plans.   The Company sponsors a 401k retirement and savings plan for
eligible employees. Participants in the savings plan may
contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a
dollar-for-dollar
basis up to 6% of eligible compensation or a maximum of
$1,200per participant.   The Companys retirement and savings plan has a defined
contribution retirement feature principally to cover
U.S.salaried employees joining the Company after
December31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
pre-established percentage of the covered employees salary
subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
Companys foreign operations participate in various local
defined contribution plans.   The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
certain of its U.S.acquired businesses for the benefit of
eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of
the participants base compensation.   The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
Directors and certain retired executives. It also provides
supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
arrangements
and/or a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP covering certain
current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental
benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement
benefits that would have been provided under the Companys
primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on
compensation that must be taken into

Amounts in 2005 and 2004 also include cash and cash equivalents.   The fair value of plan assets for these plans was
$3569million and $3415million at December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
return on these plan assets was 85% in 2005 and 89% in 2004.
Equity securities included 452,800shares of AMETEK, Inc.
common stock in the amount of $194million 54% of total
plan investment assets and 662,800shares in the amount of
$236million 69% of total plan investment assets at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S.defined benefit
plans investment strategy are to maximize the plans
funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
established. Since there may be periods of time where both
equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
overall portfolios diversification and return potential.
The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary.   The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
component.   The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
interest rate fluctuations.   Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
note aabove, certain investments are prohibited.
Prohibited investments include venture capital, private
placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading

Primarily cash and cash equivalents.   The objective of AMETEK, Inc.s foreign defined benefit
plans investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
different asset classes, relative to the plans liabilities
and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
relatively young active employee group covered by the plans, and
the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be
reviewed from time to time in view of changes in market
conditions and in the plans liability profile.

400   400   425   The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
assets. This review also considered current capital market
conditions and expectations of projected future investment
returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
The current low interest rate environment also influences this
outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans
was reduced from 850% to 825% for 2006. The expected return on
assets for the foreign plans for 2006 will be reduced from 720%
to 700%.   Estimated
future benefit payments   The estimated future benefit payments are as follows in

2008-$24,888; 2009-$25,392;
2010-$26,113; 2011 to 2015-$144,162.
Future benefit payments primarily represent amounts to be paid
from pension trust assets. Amounts included that are to be paid
from the Companys assets are not significant in any
individual year.

STATEMENTSContinued   Postretirement
Plans and Postemployment Benefits   The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
pensions for certain retirees and a small number of current and
former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not
funded and are not significant. In connection with the flood
loss and closure of the plant described in Note7, in the
fourth quarter of 2004, the Company accelerated the recognition
of deferred actuarial losses under the affected postretirement
benefit plan, resulting in a $10million pretax charge
against earnings.   The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.   The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
invested in either, or a combination of, aan
interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
the general assets of the Company, or bthe equivalent of
a fund which invests in shares of the Companys common
stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
plan, including income earned, was $73million and
$54million at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by
the Company and is not significant.

Segment and Geographic Information   Descriptive
Information about Reportable Segments   The Company has two reportable segments, the Electronic
Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group. The Company
manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments for
segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
type, production processes, distribution methods, and management
organizations.   The Electronic Instruments Group produces instrumentation for
various electronic applications used in transportation
industries, including aircraft cockpit instruments and displays,
airborne electronics systems that monitor and record flight and
engine data, and pressure, temperature, flow and liquid-level
sensors for commercial airlines and aircraft and jet engine
manufacturers. The Group also produces analytical
instrumentation for the laboratory and research markets, as well
as instruments for food service equipment, measurement and
monitoring instrumentation for various process industries and
instruments and complete instrument panels for heavy truck
manufacturers and heavy construction and agricultural vehicles.
The Group also manufactures ultraprecise measurement
instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds for
automotive, appliance, and telecommunications applications.   The Electromechanical Group EMG produces brushless
air-moving motors for aerospace, mass transit, medical
equipment, computer and business machine applications. The Group
also produces high-purity metal powders and alloys in powder,
strip, and wire form for electronic components, aircraft and
automotive products, as well as heat exchangers and thermal
management subsystems. Additionally, EMG produces air-moving
electric motors and motor-blower systems for manufacturers of
floor care appliances and outdoor power equipment. EMG also
supplies hermetically sealed moisture-proof connectors,
terminals and headers. These electromechanical devices are used
in aerospace, defense, and other industrial applications. Sales
of floor care and specialty motors represented 192% in 2005,
221% in 2004, and 254% in 2003 of the Companys
consolidated net sales.   Measurement
of Segment Results   Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
and expenses including certain administrative and other
expenses applicable to each segment, but does not include an
allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are
generally based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment
assets include allocations directly related to the
segments operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits, and deferred
taxes.

Guarantees   The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
enhance the subsidiarys stand-alone creditworthiness. The
amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
point in time. The maximum amount of future payment obligations
relative to these various guarantees was approximately
$982million, and the outstanding liability under certain
of those guarantees was approximately $408million at
December31, 2005. These guarantees expire in 2006 through
2010.   Indemnifications   In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
unfavorable financial consequences resulting from

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   specified events e.g., breaches of contract obligations, or
retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee
liabilities whose terms range in duration and often are not
explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such
indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount
of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically
stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are or were
serving at the Companys request in such capacities.
Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related
to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The
Company believes that future payments, if any, under all
existing indemnification agreements should not have a material
impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows.   Product
Warranties   The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the
most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience,
and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
expenses.   Changes in the Companys accrued product warranty
obligation for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004
were as follows in thousands

Contingencies   Asbestos
Litigation   The Company including its subsidiaries has been named as a
defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company,
or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
claims the Indemnified Claims. The Indemnified
Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
their obligations in all respects, and the Company does not have
any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their
obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been
rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related
lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the
claims being asserted, and intends to continue to vigorously
defend itself in these matters.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Environmental
Matters   Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
existing at that time, the Company has been named a Potentially
Responsible Party PRP at 20
non-AMETEK
owned sites. The Company is identified as a
de-minimis party in 14 of these sites based on the
low volume of relative waste attributed to the Company. In 10 of
these sites, the Company has reached agreement on the cost of
the de-minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is
awaiting executed agreements. The agreed to settlement amounts
are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is
continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
responsible for remedial activity at the site to establish an
appropriate settlement amount. In the six remaining sites where
the Company is a non-de-minimis PRP, the Company is
participating in the investigation
and/or
related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys
expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
this result will continue. In addition to these
non-AMETEK
owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing
reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its
current or previously owned manufacturing locations and for
claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other
environmental matters once the Company has determined that a
loss is probable and estimable. Total environmental reserves at
December31, 2005 and 2004 were $68million and
$73million, respectively. The Company spent
$10million on such environmental matters in 2005 and
2004. The Company also has agreements with former owners of
certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements,
the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to
indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other
liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
the other parties carry insurance coverage for some
environmental matters. To date, those parties have met their
obligations in all material respects. The Company has no reason
to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their
obligations in the future. However, if the Company were required
to record a liability with respect to all, or a portion of, such
matters on its balance sheet, the effect on income and the
amount of the liability could be significant. In the opinion of
management, based upon presently available information and past
experience related to such matters, either adequate provision
for probable costs has been made, or the ultimate cost resulting
from these actions is not expected to materially affect the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows of the Company.

Controls and Procedures   The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated
and communicated to management in a timely manner. The
Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the system of
disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2005.
Based on that evaluation, the Companys principal executive
officer and principal financial officer concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective
in all material respects as of December31, 2005.   Such evaluation did not identify any change in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting during
the year ended December31, 2005 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.   Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   Managements report on the Companys internal control
