Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Central European Distribution Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements ofoperations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Central European Distribution Corporation
CEDC or the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As
discussed in Notes 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the presentation of its distribution business to discontinued operations and the method of accounting of the Whitehall Group from consolidation to the equity
method in 2010. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers Sp. z o.o.

62 Table of Contents 1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization and Description of Business Central European Distribution Corporation CEDC, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as we, us, our, or the
Company operate primarily in the alcohol beverage industry. The Company is Central Europes largest integrated spirit beverages business. The Company is also the largest vodka producer by value and volume in Poland and Russia and
produces the Absolwent, Zubrowka, Bols, Parliament, Green Mark, Soplica and Zhuravli brands, among others. In addition, it produces and distributes Royal Vodka, the number one selling vodka in Hungary. As well as sales and distribution of its own
branded spirits, the Company is a leading exclusive importer of wines and spirits in Poland, Russia and Hungary. As disclosed further in the Notes, due to the sale of its distribution business completed on August2, 2010 the Company has
presented the distribution business in Poland as a discontinued operation in these restated financial statements for the year ended December31, 2009. Significant Accounting Policies The significant accounting policies
and practices followed by the Company are as follows: Basis of Presentation 
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
Company consolidates all entities that we control. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. CEDCs subsidiaries maintain their books of account and prepare their statutory financial statements in their respective local currencies. 
The subsidiaries financial statements have been adjusted to reflect accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America U.S. GAAP. Effective January1, 2010, the Company adopted required changes to consolidation guidance for
variable interest entities that require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity. This analysis identifies
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has 1the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and 2the
obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity, or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. In addition, the
required changes provide guidance on shared power and joint venture relationships, remove the scope exemption for qualified special purpose entities, revise the definition of a variable interest entity, and require additional disclosures. The
adoption of this standard and its impact on Companys financial statements is discussed further in the Note 3. Effective
January1, 2009, we also adopted the following pronouncements which require us to retrospectively restate previously disclosed consolidated financial statements. As such, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated
financial statements to conform to the current period presentation.  We adopted ASC Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options that is effective for our $3100million aggregate
principal amount of 300% Convertible Senior Notes CSN we define as Convertible Senior Notes in the Note 9 and requires retrospective application for all periods presented. The ASC Topic 470-20 requires the issuer of
convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features to separately account for the liability $2903million as of the date of the issuance of the CSNs and equity components $197million as of the date of the issuance of the CSNs
of the 
63 Table of Contents 
instrument. The debt component was recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using a 45% discount rate, our borrowing rate at the date of the issuance of the CSNs for a
similar debt instrument without the conversion feature. The equity component, recorded as additional paid-in capital, was $128million, which represents the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the CSNs and the fair value of
the liability, net of deferred taxes of $69million as of the date of the issuance of the CSNs. ASC
Topic 470-20 also requires an accretion of the resultant debt discount over the expected life of the CSNs, which is March7, 2008 to March15, 2013. The consolidated statement of operations were retroactively modified compared to
previously reported amounts as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:  Year endedDecember31,2008 Additional pre-tax non-cash interest expense 3,087 Additional deferred tax benefit 1,080 Retroactive change in net income and retained earnings 2,006 Change to basic earnings per share 005 Change to diluted earnings per share 005
For the year ended
December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, the additional pre-tax non-cash interest expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations was $41 million and $39million, respectively. Accumulated amortization related to the
debt discount was $111million and $70million as of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, respectively. The annual pre-tax increase in non-cash interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations to be recognized
until 2013, the maturity date of the CSNs, is as follows in thousands:   expense 2011 4,282 2012 4,285
The Company has
performed an evaluation of subsequent events through March1, 2011, which is the date the financial statements were issued. Use of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
For all of the Companys subsidiaries the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities
ofthese operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. The Statements of Operations are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the respective year. Translation adjustments arising from the use
of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders equity. Transaction adjustments arising from operations as well as gains and losses from any specific foreign currency transactions are included in
the reported net income/loss for the period. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been presented in U.S.
dollars.

Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is computed by the straight-line method over the following useful lives:  Type

meeting appropriate criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability. Amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed on a straight-line method over the useful life of the relevant assets.
The Company expenses de minimis amounts for $1,500 per fixed asset addition as incurred. 
The Company periodically reviews its investment in tangible fixed assets and when indicators of impairment exist, an impairment loss is
recognized. No impairments in tangible assets have been recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Goodwill
Following the adoption of ASC Topic 805 and ASC Topic 350, goodwill and certain intangible assets having indefinite
lives are no longer subject to amortization. Their book values are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances indicate the need. Fair value measurement techniques, such as the discounted cash flow methodology, are
utilized to assess potential impairments. The testing of goodwill is performed at each reporting unit level. In the discounted cash flow method, the Company discounts forecasted performance plans to their present value. The discount rate utilized is
the weighted average cost of capital for the reporting unit. USGAAP requires the impairment test to be performed in two stages. If the first stage does not indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units exceeds its fair values,
the second stage is not required. When the first stage indicates potential impairment, the company has to complete the second stage of the impairment test and compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the corresponding
carrying value of goodwill. Intangible assets other than Goodwill 
Intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trademarks relating to well established brands, and as such have been deemed to have an
indefinite life. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. Additional intangible assets include the valuation of customer contracts arising as a
result of acquisitions, these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of 8 years. Impairment of long lived
assets In accordance with ASC Topic 805 and ASC Topic 350, the Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of 
65 Table of Contents
an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value. 
In connection with the Bols, Polmos Bialystok, Parliament and Russian Alcohol acquisitions, the Company has acquired trademark rights to
various brands, which were capitalized as part of the purchase price allocation process. As these brands are well established they have been assessed to have an indefinite life. These trademarks rights will not be amortized; however, management
assesses them at least once a year for impairment. As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $1,4502 million of goodwill
and $6273 million of intangible assets, net, on our balance sheet. Substantially all of our intangible assets comprise trademark rights to various brands, which were capitalized as part of the purchase price allocation process in connection with
our acquisitions of Bols, Polmos Bialystok, Parliament and Russian Alcohol. As these brands are well established they have been assessed to have an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not amortized but rather assessed for impairment. 
In order to establish the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company has performed tests of impairment of
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which required the use of estimates. We calculated the fair market value of these assets using a discount cash flow approach and based our calculations as at December31, 2010 on the following
assumptions:  Risk free rates for Poland, Russia and Hungary used for calculation of discount rate were based upon current market rates of long term Polish
Government Bonds rates, long term Russian Government Bonds rates and long term Hungarian Government Bonds. When estimating discount rates to be used for the calculation we have taken into account current market conditions in Poland, Russia and
Hungary separately. As a result of our assumptions and calculations, we have determined discount rates of 760%, 1196% and 941% for Poland, Russia and Hungary, respectively. Factoring in a deviation of 10 basis points for the discount rate as
compared to managements estimate, there would still be no need for an impairment charge against goodwill.  We have tested goodwill for impairment separately for the following reporting units: Poland Vodka Production, Poland Import, Hungary Distribution,
Russia Vodka Production including Parliament and Russian Alcohol.  We estimated the growth rates in projecting cash flows for each of our reporting group separately, based on a detailed five year plan related to each
reporting unit.  We estimated the terminal value growth rates for our indefinite lived intangible assets within the range from 10% to 25% and for goodwill from 15%
to 25% individually for each of the reporting group. Factoring in a deviation of 10 basis points for the terminal value growth rate as compared to managements estimate, there would still be no need for an impairment charge against goodwill
and further charge for the indefinite lived intangibles. Based upon the above analysis performed and due to
the continued lower performance of certain brands as compared to expectations in 2010, primarily Absolwent and Bols, the Company has determined that the fair market value of the trademarks related to these brands has deteriorated. We
therefore recorded an impairment charge of $1318million during the fourth quarter of 2010 that included an impairment to the carrying values of our trademarks related predominately to the Absolwent and Bols brand in Poland. 
Taking into accountestimations supporting our calculations under current market trends and conditions we believe thatno
goodwill impairment charge is considered necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements. Equity investments
If the Company is not required to consolidate its investment in another company, the Company uses the equity method if
the Company can exercise significant influence over the other company. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Companys equity in the increases and decreases in the investees net assets after the date
of acquisition and certain other adjustments. The Companys share of the net income or loss of the investee is included in equity in earnings of equity method investees in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Revenue Recognition Revenues of the Company include sales of its own produced spirit brands, imported wine, beer and spirit brands as well as other third party alcoholic products purchased locally, the sale of each of these
revenues streams are all processed and accounted for in the same manner. For all of its sources of revenue, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of product has occurred, the sales price charged
is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. This generally means that revenue is recognized when title to the products are transferred to our customers. In particular, title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our
customers locations, as determined by the specific sales terms of the transactions. Sales are stated net of sales tax
VAT and reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional listing fees and advertising allowances, cash
discounts and rebates. Net sales revenue includes excise tax except in the case where the sales are made from the production unit or are related to imported goods, in which case it is recorded net of excise tax. 
Revenue Dilution 
As part of normal business terms with customers, the Company provides for additional discounts and rebates off our standard list price for
all of the products we sell. These revenue reductions are documented in our contracts with our customers and are typically associated with annual or quarterly purchasing levels as well as payment terms. These rebates are divided into on-invoice and
off-invoice discounts. The on-invoice reductions are presented on the sales invoice and deducted from the invoice gross sales value. The off-invoice reductions are calculated based on the analysis performed by management and are provided for in the
same period the related sales are recorded. Discounts or fees that are subject to contractual based term arrangements are amortized over the term of the contract. For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized
$1729 million, $1128 million and $772 million of off invoice rebates as a reduction to net sales, respectively. Certain
sales contain customer acceptance provisions that grant a right of return on the basis of either subjective criteria or specified objective criteria. Where appropriate a provision is made for product return, based upon a combination of historical
data as well as depletion information received from our larger clients. The Companys policy is to closely monitor inventory levels with our key distribution customers to ensure that we do not create excess stock levels in the market which
would result in a return of sales in the future. Historically sales returns from customers has averaged less than 1% of our net sales revenue. 
Shipping and Handling Costs Where the Company has incurred costs in shipping goods to its warehouse facilities these costs are recorded as part of inventory and then to costs of goods sold. Shipping and handling costs associated
with distribution are recorded in operating expenses. The dollar amounts of shipping and handling costs associated with distribution were $190 million, $455 million and $560 million for the fiscal years ended December31, 2008, 2009, and
2010, respectively. The significant year to year increase is primarily due to the Companys acquisition of Russian Alcohol which we started consolidating since second quarter of 2009. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivables are recorded based on the
invoice price, inclusive of VAT sales tax, and where a delivery note has been signed by the customer and returned to the Company. The allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon the aging of the accounts receivable, whereby the Company makes
an allowance based on a sliding scale. The Company typically does not provide for past due amounts due from large international retail chains hypermarkets and supermarkets as there have historically not been any issues with collectability of these
amounts. However, where circumstances require, the Company will also make specific provisions for any 
67 Table of Contents
excess not provided for under the general provision. When an evidence is delivered to the Company regarding the non-recovery of a receivable, the Company then charges the unrecoverable amount to
the accumulated allowance. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market value. Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and are classified as follows: December31,2010 December31,2009 Raw materials and supplies 26,847 31,220 In-process inventories 3,314 2,914 Finished goods and goods for resale 63,517 58,082 Total 93,678 92,216 Because of the nature of the products supplied by the Company, great attention is paid to inventory
rotation. The number of days in inventory decreased from at approximately 97 days as of December31, 2009 to approximately 90 days as of December31, 2010. Where goods are estimated to be obsolete or unmarketable they are written down to a
value reflecting the net realizable value in their relevant condition. Cost includes customs duty where applicable, and all
costs associated with bringing the inventory to a condition for sale. These costs include importation, handling, storage and transportation costs, and exclude rebates received from suppliers, which are reflected as reductions to closing inventory.
Inventories are comprised primarily of beer, wine, spirits, packaging materials and non-alcoholic beverages. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Short-term investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash
equivalents. Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes The Company computes and records income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the accounting and tax basis of the
underlying assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Employee Retirement Provisions The Companys employees are
entitled to retirement payments and in some cases payments for long-service jubilee awards and accordingly the Company provides for the current value of the liability related to these benefits. A provision is calculated based on the
terms set in the collective labor agreement. The amount of the provision for retirement bonuses depends on the age of employees and the pre-retirement time of work for the Company and typically equals one month salary. 
The Company does not create a specific fund designated for these payments and all payments related to the benefits are charged to the
accrued liability. The provision for the employees benefits is calculated annually using the projected unit method and any losses or gains resulting from the valuation are immediately recognized in the statement of operations. 
The Company also contributes to State and privately managed defined contribution plans. Contributions to defined contribution plans are
charged to the statement of operations in the period in which they are incurred.

Employee Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company adopted ASC Topic 718 CompensationStock Compensation requiring the recognition of compensation expense in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the fair value of its employee share-based options. The Company
recognizes the cost of all employee stock options on a straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company has selected the modified prospective method of transition; accordingly, prior
periods have not been restated. ASC Topic 718 requires the recognition of compensation expense related to the fair value of
employee share-based options. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise, the associated volatility and the
expected dividends. Judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting. If actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates, share-based compensation expense could be
materially impacted. The Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan provides for the grant of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors, executives, and other employees employees of the Company and to non-employee service providers of the Company. Following a shareholder
resolution in April 2003 and the stock splits of May 2003,May 2004 and June 2006, the Incentive Plan authorizes, and the Company has reserved for future issuance, up to 1,397,333 shares of Common Stock subject to an anti-dilution adjustment
in the event of a stock split, re-capitalization, or similar transaction. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administers the Incentive Plan. The option exercise price for stock options granted under the Incentive Plan may not be less than fair value but in some cases may be in excess of the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of
grant. The Company uses the stock option price based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the day before the date of grant if such price is not materially different than the opening price of the Common Stock on the day of the grant. Stock
options may be exercised up to 10 years after the date of grant except as otherwise provided in the particular stock option agreement. Payment for the shares must be in cash, which must be received by the Company prior to any shares being issued.
Stock options granted to directors and officers as part of an employee employment contract vest after 2 years. Stock options granted to general employees as part of a loyalty program vest after three years. The Incentive Plan was approved by CEDC
shareholders during the annual shareholders meeting on April30, 2007 to replace the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the Old Stock Incentive Plan, which expired in November 2007. The Stock Incentive Plan will expire in
November 2017. The terms and conditions of the Stock Incentive Plan are substantially similar to those of the Old Stock Incentive Plan. Before January1, 2006 CEDC, the holding company, realized net operating losses and therefore an excess tax benefit windfall resulting from the exercise of the awards and a related credit to
Additional Paid-in Capital APIC of $22 million was not recorded in the Companys books. The excess tax benefits and the credit to APIC for the windfall should not be recorded until the deduction reduces income taxes payable on the basis that
cash tax savings have not occurred. The Company will recognize the windfall upon realization. Comprehensive Income/Loss
Comprehensive income/loss is defined as all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from
investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income/loss includes net income/loss adjusted by, among other items, foreign currency translation adjustments. The translation gains/losses on the translation from foreign
currencies primarily the Polish zloty and Russian ruble to U.S. dollars are classified separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity. 
69 Table of Contents
As of December31, 2010, the Polish zloty and Russian ruble exchange rates used to
translate the balance sheet weakened compared to the exchange rate as of December31, 2009, and as a result a loss to comprehensive income was recognized. Segment Reporting The Company primarily operates in one industry
segment, the production and sale of alcoholic beverages. As a result of the Companys expansion in 2008 and 2009 into new geographic areas, namely Russia, the Company has implemented a segmental approach to the business based upon geographic
locations. Net Income/loss per Common Share Net income per common share is calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share. Basic earnings/loss per share EPS are computed by dividing income/loss available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. The stock options and warrants discussed in Note 13 were included in the computation of diluted earnings/losses per common share Note19. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2010, FASB issued guidance that provides for additional financial statement disclosure regarding financing receivables, including the credit quality and allowance for credit losses associated with
such assets. This guidance is generally effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, with certain disclosures effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 31, 2010. We will fully adopt this
guidance in the 2011 first quarter, and we do not currently believe that the implementation will have any impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The FASB issued new disclosure requirements that require the disaggregation of the Level 3 fair value measurement reconciliations into separate categories for significant purchases, sales, issuances, and
settlements. We will fully adopt this guidance in the 2011 first quarter, and we do not currently believe that the implementation will have any impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 
In December 2010, the FASB issued new guidance on performing goodwill impairment tests. The new guidance eliminates the option to exclude
liabilities that are part of the capital structure of the reporting unit when calculating the carrying value of the reporting unit. We will fully adopt this guidance in the 2011 first quarter, and we are currently evaluating the impact of the
implementation on our results of operations and financial condition. 
2. Acquisitions Acquisitions made prior to December31, 2008 were accounted for in accordance with SFASNo141, Business Combinations. Effective January1, 2009, all business combinations
are accounted for in accordance with FAS 141R that is codified as ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations. The Parliament
Acquisition On March 11, 2008, the Company and certain of its affiliates entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement
and certain other agreements with White Horse Intervest Limited, a British Virgin Islands Company, and certain of White Horses affiliates, relating to the Companys acquisition from White Horse of 85% of the share capital of Copecresto
Enterprises Limited, a Cypriot company, which we refer to as Parliament. In connection with this acquisition, the Company paid a consideration of approximately $180 million in cash and 22 million shares of common stock. 
70 Table of Contents
On September 22, 2009, the Company and certain of its affiliates and Seller entered into
ian amendment to the Original SPA the Amendment and iia Share Sale and Purchase Agreement the Minority Acquisition SPA. Under the terms of the Amendment, certain post-closing obligations in the Original
SPA regarding payment for certain assets were finalized in order to facilitate completion of the transactions contemplated by the Original SPA, in connection with the completion of the Companys acquisition of Copecresto pursuant to the
Minority Acquisition SPA. In connection with the Amendment, the Company was required to pay to Seller the remaining consideration for such assets of approximately $167 million The Company paid $99 million of that amount on October30, 2009
and the remaining amount was paid on December 16, 2009. Under the terms of the Minority Acquisition SPA, upon the closing
thereof on September 22, 2009, the Company, through an affiliate, acquired the remaining 15% of the share capital of Copecresto from Seller for total cash consideration of $70,167,734. In addition, on September 25, 2009, in connection with the
closing of the Minority Acquisition SPA, the Shareholders Agreement, dated March 13, 2008, by and among the Company, a subsidiary of the Company, Seller and Copecresto was terminated. The Minority Acquisition SPA contains certain customary
representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of this type. Under requirements of ASC Topic 810-10
Consolidation a change in ownership interests that does not result in change of control is considered an equity transaction. The identifiable net assets as of December 31, 2009 remain unchanged and any difference between the amount by
which the NCI is adjusted, and the fair value of the consideration paid is recognized directly in equity and attributed to the controlling interest. Thus we have recorded the 15% increase in ownership interests of Copecresto as a transaction within
equity. As a result of this transaction, NCI in Copecresto decreased by $269 million together with decrease in Additional Paid In Capital of $433 million, which was offset by cash outflow of $702 million. 
The Whitehall Acquisition 
ASU 2009-17 was effective for the Company from January 1, 2010. Due to the revision of ASC Topic 810, including the redefining of
control, and because the day-to-day control over the business has been delegated to the CEOMark Kaufman and the list of activities for which the Company has overview is limited, the Company changed the accounting treatment for its
49% voting interest in Whitehall Group from consolidation to the equity method of accounting. Adoption of the requirements of
ASC Topic 810 resulted as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 in a net decrease in assets of $106 million and $93 million, liabilities of $85 million and $96 million and non-controlling interest of $23 million and $34 million, respectively.
Please refer to Note 1 for the disclosure impact from the adoption of ASC Topic 810 on the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December31, 2009. The Russian Alcohol Acquisition On January20, 2010, after the
receipt of antimonopoly clearances for the acquisition from the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Commission, the Antimonopoly Committee of the Ukraine, the Company purchased the sole voting share of Lion/Rally Cayman 6 Cayman 6 from an
affiliate of Lion Capital LLP Lion and thereby acquired control of Russian Alcohol. Starting from the second
quarter of 2009, the Company began consolidating all profit and loss results for Russian Alcohol.

The goodwill arising out of
Russian Alcohol acquisition is attributable to the expansion of our sales and distribution platform in Russia that it provides to the Company as well as expected synergies to be utilized from consolidation of our Russian operations. 
The Company recorded a provision for contingent consideration at fair value for $50 million as of the acquisition date. This
consideration was settled in the three month period ended September30, 2009 through a payment by the Company of $65 million, which included an additional $15 million in earn-out payments. 
Resulting from the acquisition of Russian Alcohol, the Company recognized a one-time gain on re-measurement of previously held equity
interest in the six month period ended June30, 2009. The fair value of this gain amounts to $2256 million. During the
second quarter of 2009, Russian Alcohol made payments related to pre-acquisition tax penalties amounting to $288 million. These costs are to be reimbursed by the sellers and have been deducted from the loans payable to them.

In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance on variable interest entities. ASU 2009-17, Consolidations Topic 810 Improvements
to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities VIE, amended prior guidance requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interest or interests
give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. Determining who consolidates a VIE is based on two requirements: iwho has the power over key decisions, and iiwho has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. If one party has both, then that party consolidates the entity. Power is based on who controls the decisions that most significantly impact the economic activities of the entity.
Except for the amount of $76 million that was lent at market rates as working capital by the Company to the Whitehall Group,
which was repaid in the first quarter of 2010, there were no transfers of financial assets to VIE as the Whitehall Group is generally a self financing entity. The Company does not have any continuing involvement with transferred financial assets
that allow the transferors to receive cash flows or other benefits from the assets or requires the transferors to provide cash flows or other assets in relation to the transferred financial assets. 
According to the Whitehall Group shareholders agreement, Whitehall Group shall be under the sole effective control of its majority
shareholder Mark Kaufman or one of his affiliates acting in the capacity of CEO. Mark Kaufman shall be responsible for the management and operations of Whitehall Groups business, his actions in certain areas are, however, dependent on the
consent of the board of directors. ASU 2009-17 was effective for the Company from January1, 2010. Due to the revision
of ASC Topic 810, including the redefining of control, and because the day-to-day control over the business has been delegated to the CEOMark Kaufman and the list of activities for which the Company has overview is limited, the
Company changed the accounting treatment for its 49% voting interest in Whitehall Group from consolidation to the equity method of accounting. Adoption of the requirements of ASC Topic 810 resulted as of December31, 2009 in a net decrease in assets of $108 million, liabilities of $85 million and non-controlling interest of $23 million As
of December31, 2010 we continue to hold 50% minus one vote of the voting power and 80% of the total economic shares of

Whitehall. However, on February7, 2011, the Company and Mark Kaufman entered into a definitive Share Sale and Purchase Agreement the SPA and registration rights
agreement the Registration Rights Agreement, as to which the terms of each were agreed by the parties on November29, 2010 Pursuant to the SPA, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, on February7, 2011 aPolmos ireceived 1,500 Class B shares of Peulla
Enterprises Limited, a private limited liability company organized under the laws of Cyprus and the parent of WHL Holdings Limited Peulla, representing the remainder of the economic interests in Peulla not owned by Polmos and
iidelivered to Seller and Kaufman an aggregate $685 million in cash in immediately available funds; and bthe Company ireceived 3,751 ClassA shares of Peulla, representing the remainder of the voting interests in Peulla
not owned by the Company or Polmos and iiissued to Kaufman 959,245 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $001 per share the Share Consideration. The issued shares had an aggregate value of $230 million
based on the 30 day volume weighted average price of a share of our common stock on the day prior to the closing. In addition, if the aggregate value of such shares based on the lower of the trading price of a share of our common stock or the 10
day volume weighted average price is less than $230 million on the day prior to filing a registration statement for resale of the shares or the day shares are sold under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the recipient of such shares is entitled to a
payment in cash equal to such difference in value. Such amount is not yet determinable. 
4. Discontinued operations For the purpose of financial reporting we analyzed the requirements of US-GAAP mainly ASC 360-10 PPE and ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements and concluded that as of
March31, 2010, the Companys distribution business met the required criteria defined in these standards and therefore it was necessary to present its distribution business, described below, as a component held for sale and as discontinued
operations. There were no changes in that determination in the following periods until the sales transaction date of August2, 2010. On April8, 2010, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Carey Agri International Poland sp. z o.o. Carey Agri, entered into a Preliminary Agreement on Sale of Shares the
Preliminary Agreement with Eurocash S.A. Eurocash pursuant to which ithe Company agreed to sell all shares of Astor sp. z o.o., Dako-Galant Przedsiebiorstwo Handlowo Produkcyjne sp. z o.o., Damianex S.A., Delikates

Handlu Spozywczego sp. z o.o. and Saol Dystrybucja sp. z o.o., representing 100% of the Companys distribution business in Poland to Eurocash and iiEurocash agreed to pay total consideration of 400million Polish zlotys $137
million in cash, on a debt free, cash free basis, subject to potential price adjustments if any and Polish anti-trust approval the Total Consideration. On August2, 2010 the Company has closed the sale of 100% of its distribution business and under the terms of the Preliminary Agreement, the Total Consideration was deposited into an escrow account
to be released upon deletion of security by Eurocash; in any event, 75% of the Total Consideration would be released to the Company 90 days following the transaction closing date. The escrow was released on September23, 2010. 
In addition, On April8, 2010, the Company also entered into a Distribution Agreement with Eurocash pursuant to which Eurocash will
distribute the Companys portfolio of brands and exclusive import brands in Poland for a period of six years. During the
year ended December31, 2010 the Company recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill upon the sale of the distribution business of 808 Polish zlotys $282 million. The results of the distribution business are included in earnings from
discontinued operations, net of taxes, for all periods presented. 
74 Table of Contents
As already mentioned above, on August2, 2010 the Company has closed the sale of 100%
of its distribution business in Poland to Eurocash SA for a purchase price of 3786million Polish zlotys in cash, on a debt free, cash free basis, after all price adjustments. As shown in the table below resulting from disposal the Company
realized in the three month period ended September30, 2010 a gain on sale amounting to $352 million being the difference between the value of the net assets of the disposed business decreased by costs associated directly to disposal and cash
received by the Company.  Cash Received 124,160 less Assets of discontinued operations 173,168 Liabilities of discontinued operations 119,921 OCI related to discontinued operations 19,549 Goodwill of discontinued operations 52,306 Total net book value of discontinued operations 86,004 Expenses related directly to disposal of discontinued operations 2,991 Gain on disposal 35,165 The Company will continue to generate cash flows from the distribution business after its sale to Eurocash
as the Company has signed a six year agreement with Eurocash for the distribution of certain of CEDCs portfolio of its own brands and other exclusive import brands in Poland. Management has concluded, however, that sales of products other than
CEDCs constituted the significant portion of the distribution business. CEDC estimates that sales of its products through the transferred distribution network will not exceed 10% of the sales of the Company, on a consolidated basis. Management
does not consider the cash flows expected to be generated under the distribution agreement with Eurocash to be significant in the future. Results of discontinued operations were as follows: Year ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 348,898 633,394 907,668 Earnings/losses from operations before taxes 18,812 9,410 27,203 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations 35,165 0 0 Taxes on earningsoperations 37 1,050 5,169 Goodwill Impairment 28,168 0 0 Earnings/losses from discontinued operations 11,778 8,360 22,034

In the fourth
quarter of 2009 the Company adjusted the value of goodwill recognized on the acquisition of Russian Alcohol due to new information as noted below. In April 2009, when CEDC restructured its buyout agreement for Russian Alcohol with Lion and the initial put/call structure was replaced with a series of option payments that transferred ownership
Option Agreement of Russian Alcohol to CEDC over time, the management incentive program was also revised between Lion and its managers. At the time Lion communicated to CEDC that the cost of this incentive payment would be
approximately $20 million. Therefore in the revised option agreement it was agreed that Russian Alcohol would fund the payment of up to $20 million and any payment over this would be covered directly by Lion. At that point in time CEDC viewed the
payment of $20 million payable over the period of the Option Agreement as fixed and viewed this part of the effective purchase price of Russian Alcohol. However full information on this was not available at the time of the original PPA in April
2009, therefore this expense was not allocated. Upon obtaining full clarity on this at year end, the Company believes it should have been originally allocated to goodwill and therefore the goodwill was increased for this amount less $4 million of
deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of 2009. When CEDC revised the purchase structure of Russian Alcohol to accelerate
the option payments and acquire the remaining amount on November19, 2009, the payment of the Management Incentive program was also accelerated with the full amount of payment $20 million materializing in January 2010. 
Moreover the Company decreased the goodwill for the amount of $66 in the fourth quarter of 2009. This relates to change of deferred tax
liability resulting from an error in the initial goodwill calculation. 
8. Intangible Assets other than Goodwill The major components of intangible assets are:  December31,2010 December31,2009 Non-amortizable intangible assets Trademarks 759,070 795,543 Impairment 131,849 22,589 Total 627,221 772,954 Amortizable intangible assets Customer relationships 815 847 Less accumulated amortization 694 579 Total 121 268 Total intangible assets 627,342 773,222 Management considers trademarks that are indefinite-lived assets to have high or market-leader brand

volumes sold and their general market positions relative to other products in their respective market segments. These trademarks include Soplica, Zubrowka, Absolwent, Royal, Parliament, Green
Mark, Zhuravli and the rights for Bols Vodka in Poland, Hungary and Russia. Taking the above into consideration, as well as the evidence provided by analyses of vodka products life cycles, market studies, competitive and environmental trends,
management believes that these brands will generate cash flows for an indefinite period of time, and that the useful lives of these brands are indefinite. In accordance with ASC Topic 350-30, intangible assets with an indefinite life are not
amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment. The Company recognized impairment charges of $1318 million for
the twelve months ended December31, 2010 related predominately to the Abwolent brand in Poland and an impairment charge $203 million for the twelve months ended December31, 2009 related to the Bols brand in Poland. 
Estimated aggregate future amortization expenses for intangible assets that have a definite life are as follows:  2011 121 2012 0 2013 0 2014 0 2015 and above 0 Total 121 9.

Bank Facilities On
December 17, 2010, the Company entered into a term and overdraft facilities Agreement the Credit Facility with Bank Handlowy w Warszawie S.A., as Agent, Original Lender and Security Agent, and Bank Zachodni WBK S.A., as Original
Lender. The Credit Facility provides for a credit limit of up to 3300 million Polish zloty or approximately $ 1115 million which may be disbursed as one term loan and two overdraft facilities to be used to irefinance existing credit
facilities and iifinance general business purposes of the Borrowers. On December 20, 2010, the Company drew approximately 1300 million Polish zloty or approximately $439 million, and used the net proceeds to repay previous loan
facilities with other lenders. The term loan initially bore interest at a rate equal to a margin of 225% plus the Warsaw
Interbank Rate plus the percentage per annum reflecting certain mandatory costs payable by the Lenders. The term loan matures 
79 Table of Contents
48 months after the date on which the advance is made. As of December31, 2010, the Company had utilized approximately 1300 million Polish zloty $439 million of the Term Loan. The
overdraft facilities initially bore interest at a rate equal to a margin of 125% plus the Warsaw Interbank Rate plus the percentage per annum reflecting certain mandatory costs payable by the Lenders. The overdraft facilities mature 12 months after
the date on which the term loan advance is made. As of December31, 2010, the Company did not have any outstanding amounts under the overdraft facilities, and 2000 million Polish zloty $676 million remained available under the overdraft
facilities. The Credit Facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit
or restrict our ability to merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate, make acquisitions and investments, dispose of or transfer assets, change the nature of our business or incur additional indebtedness, in each case, subject to certain
qualifications and exceptions. In addition, the Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, which include, but are
not limited to, a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges the Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 2:1 and a maximum ratio of total debt less cash to EBITDA the Net Leverage Ratio of i 5:1 for the Calculation Period defined
below ending on December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011, ii 45:1 for the Calculation Period ending on June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012, iii 4:1 for the Calculation Period ending on June30, 2012 and
September 30, 2012, iv 35:1 for the Calculation Period ending on December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 and v 3:1 for each subsequent Calculation Period. The Consolidated Coverage Ratio and the Net Leverage Ratio are each calculated at the end of
each period of twelve months immediately preceding the last day of each of our fiscal quarters each a Calculation Period. As of December 31, 2010, primarily due to the factors that negatively affected our 2010 financial performance discussed above, including introductory costs associated with the launch of Biala, increased
raw spirit prices due to the summer drought in Russia and Eastern Europe and our inability to obtain excise stamps in our primary production in Russia in the fourth quarter of 2010, our Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 17 and our Net
Leverage Ratio was approximately 64. We were therefore not in compliance with the Consolidated Coverage Ratio covenant and the Net Leverage Ratio covenant as of December 31, 2010. 
On February 28, 2011 we entered into a letter agreement with Bank Handlowy w Warszawie S.A. and Bank Zachodni WBK S.A. the Letter
Agreement pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the parties agreed, among other things, to waive any breach of the Consolidated Coverage Ratio covenant and the Net Leverage Ratio covenant relating to the
measurement period ending on December 31, 2010, and amended these ratios for purposes of the measurement period ending on March 31, 2011 to 128:1 and 835:1, respectively. As a result of the Letter Agreement, our failure to comply with the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio covenant and the Net Leverage Ratio covenant as of December 31, 2010 did not result in a default under the Credit Facility. We continue to work with our lenders under the Credit Facility to seek a further amendment to
these ratios for future measurement periods, and we and our lenders have agreed to cooperate in good faith to reach agreement on revised terms and conditions of the Credit Facility by June 30, 2011. Although we cannot provide any definitive
assurances as to future compliance with these ratios, we currently expect to satisfy these ratios, as amended by the Letter Agreement, for the measurement period ending on March 31, 2011; however, absent a further amendment to the facility, we
currently project that we would not satisfy either of the ratios as of the remaining measurement periods in 2011. In addition to any rights our lenders have under the Credit Facility, if we have not agreed revised terms with our lenders by June 30,
2011, the Letter Agreement provides that they will have the right at any time on or after July 29, 2011 to declare the facility due and payable. In connection with the Letter Agreement, we have agreed to pay a one-time waiver fee of PLN 33 million approximately US$115 million. In addition, we have agreed with our lenders that the amount
available to us under the overdraft facilities included in the Credit Facility is reduced to PLN 120 million approximately US$416 million and the margins on our term loan and overdraft facilities will be increased with effect from
80 Table of Contents
March 1, 2011 to 425% and 325%, respectively, and the margin on letters of credit issued thereunder will be increased to 250%. The amount available to us under the overdraft facilities may be
increased, and the margins may be decreased, at the sole discretion of the lenders after completion of a due diligence process. As of the date hereof, $73 million was outstanding under the overdraft facility. 
If we fail to satisfy the Consolidated Coverage Ratio or the Net Leverage Ratio in any future measurement period thereunder, and such
failure is not waived or cured, it could result in acceleration of the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that include cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions including if the amount of indebtedness accelerated
exceeds US$300 million, the indentures for our senior secured notes due 2016 and our convertible senior notes. We may seek alternative financing whether or not we reach a satisfactory agreement with our lenders in respect of the Credit Facility.
Such financing may include equity and/or debt financing, which may be secured, and we may seek to repay all or a portion of the Credit Facility with proceeds of such financing or a combination of such proceeds and cash on hand. We have a right to
prepay the term facility in whole or in part, at any time on 10 business days notice. We cannot assure you whether, or on what terms, such transactions may be available to us, and such availability and our view as to the advisability of engaging in
any such transaction or combination of transactions will depend upon, among other things, market, economic, business and other conditions and expectations then existing. Additionally as of December 31, 2010, full amount of $415 million remained available under overdraft facilities from Pekao S.A,and BRE Bank with maturity dates on April 30, 2011 and February 24, 2011
respectively. As of December 31, 2010 Bols Hungary full amount of $05 million remained available under overdraft facilities

Income and Deferred Taxes The Company operates in several tax jurisdictions primarily: the United States of America, Poland, Hungary and Russia. All subsidiaries file their own corporate tax returns as well as account for their
own deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company does not file a tax return in United States based upon its consolidated income, but does file a return in the United States based on the statements of operations for transactions occurring in the
United States of America. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-25 Income taxes. ASC 740-10-25
prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial
statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be
derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties. 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S., Poland, Hungary, Russia, as well as in various other countries throughout the world in
which we conduct our business. The major tax jurisdictions and their earliest fiscal years that are currently open for tax examinations are 2005 in the U.S., 2005 in Poland and Hungary and 2007 in Russia.

CEDCs U.S. federal income tax returns are also subject to examination by the U.S. tax
authorities. As the application of tax laws and regulations, and transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determination by the tax
authorities. 
13. Stock Option Plans and Warrants The Company recognizes the cost of all employee stock options on a straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. 
The Companys 2007 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors, executives, and other employees employees of the Company and to non-employee service providers of the Company. Following a shareholder resolution in April 2003 and the
stock splits of May 2003,May 2004 and June 2006, the Incentive Plan authorizes, and the Company has reserved for future issuance, up to 1,397,333 shares of Common Stock subject to an anti-dilution adjustment in the event of a stock split,
re-capitalization, or similar transaction. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company administers the Incentive Plan. The option exercise price for stock options granted under the Incentive Plan may not be less than fair market value but in some cases may be in excess of the closing price of the Common Stock on the date
of grant. The Company uses the stock option price based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the day before the date of grant if such price is not materially different than the opening price of the Common Stock on the day of the grant. Stock
options may be exercised up to 10 years after the date of grant except as otherwise provided in the particular stock option agreement. Payment for the shares must be in cash, which must be received by the Company prior to any shares being issued.
Stock options granted to directors and officers as part of an employee employment contract vest after 2 years. Stock options granted to general employees as part of a loyalty program vest after three years. The Incentive Plan was approved by CEDC
shareholders during the annual shareholders meeting on April30, 2007 to replace the Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the Old Stock Incentive Plan, which expired in November 2007. The Stock Incentive Plan will expire in
November 2017. The terms and conditions of the Stock Incentive Plan are substantially similar to those of the Old Stock Incentive Plan. Before January1, 2006 CEDC, the holding company, realized net operating losses and therefore an excess tax benefit windfall resulting from the exercise of the awards and a related credit to
Additional Paid-in Capital APIC of $22 million was not recorded in the Companys books. The excess tax benefits and the credit to APIC for the windfall should not be recorded until the deduction reduces income taxes payable on the basis that
cash tax savings have not occurred. The Company will recognize the windfall upon realization.

During 2010, the range of exercise prices for outstanding options was $113 to $6092.
During 2010, the weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding was 53 years. Exercise prices for options exercisable as of December31, 2010 ranged from $113 to $6092. 
The Company has issued stock options to employees under stock based compensation plans. Stock options are issued at the current market
price, subject to a vesting period, which varies from one to three years. As of December31, 2010, the Company has not changed the terms of any outstanding awards. During the year ended December31, 2010, the Company recognized compensation cost of $32 million and a related deferred tax asset of $054 million. 
As of December31, 2010, there was $20 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options,
restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the Plan. The costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 months through 2011-2013. Total cash received from exercise of options during the year ended December31, 2010 amounted to $37 million. For the year period ended December31, 2010, the compensation expense related to all options was calculated based on the fair value of each option grant using the binomial distribution model. The
Company has never paid cash dividends and does not currently have plans to pay cash dividends, and thus has assumed a 0% dividend yield. Expected volatilities are based on average of implied and historical volatility projected over the remaining
term of the options. The expected life of stock options is estimated based on historical data on exercise of stock options, post-vesting forfeitures and other factors to estimate the expected term of the stock options granted. The risk-free interest
rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for instruments with a remaining term similar to the expected life of the options. In addition, the Company applies an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing
stock-based compensation expenses. The estimate of the forfeiture rates is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover. As individual grant awards become fully vested, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted to recognize
actual forfeitures. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in the calculation of fair value:  2010

14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities The Company is involved in litigation from time to time and has claims against it in connection with matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations. The Polmos Bialystok Acquisition 
As part of the Share Purchase Agreement related to the October 2005 Polmos Bialystok Acquisition, the Company is required to ensure that
Polmos Bialystok will make investments of at least 775million Polish zloty during the six years after the acquisition was consummated. As of December31, 2010, the Company had invested 758million Polish zloty approximately $256
million in Polmos Bialystok.

parties on November29, 2010 Pursuant to the SPA, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained therein, on February7, 2011 aPolmos ireceived 1,500 Class B shares of Peulla Enterprises Limited, a private limited liability company organized under the laws of Cyprus and the parent of WHL Holdings Limited

ireceived 3,751 ClassA shares of Peulla, representing the remainder of the voting interests in Peulla not owned by the Company or Polmos and iiissued to Kaufman 959,245 shares of the Companys common stock, par value $001
per share the Share Consideration. The issued shares had an aggregate value of $230 million based on the 30 day volume weighted average price of a share of our common stock on the day prior to the closing. In addition, if the
aggregate value of such shares based on the lower of the trading price of a share of our common stock or the 10 day volume weighted average price is less than $230 million on the day prior to filing a registration statement for resale of the
shares or the day shares are sold under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, the recipient of such shares is entitled to a payment in cash equal to such difference in value. Such amount is not yet determinable. Pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement, the Company agreed to prepare and file with the SEC an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Securities Act with respect to the Share Consideration the Registration
Statement as promptly as possible. The Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and, in any event, no later than 30 days after the date
of issuance. Operating Leases and Rent Commitments The Company makes rental payments for real estate, vehicles, office, computer, and manufacturing equipment under operating leases. The following is a schedule by years of the future rental payments under
the non-cancelable operating lease as of December31, 2010:  2011 8,477 2012 8,990 2013 9,533 2014 10,112 2015 10,733 Thereafter 11,395 Total 59,240 During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company continued its policy of renewing its transportation fleet by
way of capital leases. The future minimum lease payments for the assets under capital lease as of December31, 2010 are as follows:  2011 758 2012 1,175 2013 0 Gross payments due 1,933 Less interest 155 Net payments due 1,778 Supply contracts The Company has various agreements covering its sources of supply, which, in some cases, may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice. Thus, there is a risk that a portion of the
Companys supply of products could be curtailed at any time.

Licenses and permits We are currently required to have various permits and licenses to produce and import products, maintain and operate our warehouses, and distribute our products to wholesalers. Some of these licenses in
Russia are scheduled to expire in 2011. Many of these permits and licenses, such as our general permit for wholesale trade, must be renewed when they expire. A delay in renewal could have an effect on our business, however we are currently unable to
estimate the impact of any potential delays on our financial statements, should such delays take place. 
15. Stockholders Equity On April22, 2010, in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement dated November19, 2009, the Company exercised its right to issue to Cayman 4 and Cayman 5, in settlement of consideration
owed under the Lion Option Agreement, 799,330 shares and 278,745 shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock the Share Issuance. The impact of the Share Issuance was to repay $45 million of the $50 million of deferred

Total other non operating
expenses increased by $127 million, from $09 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 to $136 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. This increase is mainly a result of the one-time charge of $141 million related to
the early call premium when the Senior Secured Notes due 2012 were repaid early in January 2010. Further increase was due to the write-off of the unamortized offering costs related to the Senior Secured Notes due 2012 as well as the professional
services expense incurred in connection with the sale of the distribution business in Poland which was offset with the dividend received. The table below summarizes the split of other non operating expenses.

Earnings/loss per share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated.  Twelve months ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Basic Income / loss from continuing operations attributable to CEDC 92,889 72,677 36,952 Income / loss on discontinued operations 11,778 8,360 22,034 Net income / loss 104,667 81,037 14,918 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate basic EPS 70,058 53,772 44,088 Net effect of dilutive employee stock options based on the treasury stock method 216 208 657 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used to calculate diluted EPS 70,274 53,980 44,745 Net income / loss per common sharebasic Continuing operations 132 135 084 Discontinued operations 017 016 050 149 151 034 Net income / loss per common sharediluted Continuing operations 132 135 084 Discontinued operations 017 015 049 149 150 034 As of December31, 2008, the Company excluded 657thousand shares from the above EPS from
continuing operations calculation because they would have had antidilutive impact for the 2008 period presented. Employee
stock options grants have been included in the above calculations of diluted earnings per share since the exercise price is less than the average market price of the common stock during the twelve months periods ended December31, 2010, 2009
and 2008. In addition there is no adjustment to fully diluted shares related to the Convertible Senior Notes as the average market price was below the conversion price for the period. 
90 Table of Contents 20. Fair value measurements Financial Instruments and Their Fair Values Financial instruments consist
mainly of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, bank loans, overdraft facilities and long-term debt. The monetary assets represented by these financial instruments are primarily located in Poland, Hungary and Russia.
Consequently, they are subject to currency translation risk when reporting in U.S. Dollars. The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:  Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, equity method investment in affiliatesthe carrying amount approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments. 
21. Operating segments As a result of the Companys expansion into new geographic areas, namely Russia, the Company has changed its internal management financial reporting by implementing a segmental approach to the
business based upon geographic locations. As such the Company operates in three primary segments: Poland, Russia and Hungary. The business segments reflect how the Companys operations are managed, how operating performance within the Company
is evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting. The Company evaluates performance
based on operating income of the respective business units. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting policies in Note 1 and include the recently issued
accounting pronouncement described in Note 1. Transactions between segments consist primarily of sales of products and are accounted for at cost plus an applicable margin, and are eliminated on the consolidation. 
The Companys areas of operations are principally in Poland, Russia and Hungary. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the
location of the selling company.  Segment Net RevenuesYear ended

93 Table of Contents 23. Quarterly financial information Unaudited The Companys net sales, gross profit, operating income and net income for 2010 and 2009 have been allocated to quarters using the same proportion as our previously reported data. The table below
demonstrates the movement and significance of seasonality in the statements of operations. For further information, please refer to Item6. Selected Financial Data.

For the quarters where net
loss was recognized, the net income / loss from operations per share of common stock, diluted was calculated without the net effect of dilutive employee stock option based on the treasury stock method, while it would have had
antidilutive impact. Seasonality is calculated as a percent of full year sales recognized in the relevant quarter. 24.

Control and Procedures. 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Based upon the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report,
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rule 13a-15f and Rule 15d-15f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, using the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2010. 
Inherent Limitations in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. 
The Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the control system are met. Because of the limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
Further, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their objectives. Changes to Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer conclude that, during the most recent
fiscal quarter, there have been no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
