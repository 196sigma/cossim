REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Stoneridge, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Stoneridge, Inc. an Ohio corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998
and 1997 and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                               Arthur Andersen LLP Cleveland, Ohio,
January 28, 1999.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except for share and per share data 1. Nature of Business
Stoneridge is an independent designer and manufacturer of engineered
electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive,
medium and heavy duty truck, and agricultural vehicle markets. Stoneridge
operates in one business segment.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Stoneridge and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries
collectively, the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
stated at cost, which approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable
Revenues are principally generated from the automotive, medium and
heavy duty truck, and agricultural vehicle markets. Due to the nature of these
industries, a significant portion of sales and related accounts receivable are
concentrated in a relatively low number of customers. In 1998, three customers
accounted for approximately 25%, 18% and 10% of net sales, while the top five
customers accounted for 72% of net sales. The same three customers accounted for
approximately 32%, 21% and 10% of the Company 1997 net sales, and its top five
customers accounted for approximately 76% of its 1997 net sales. Accounts
receivable from the Company five largest customers aggregated approximately
$51,927 and $45,210 at December 31, 1998, and 1997, respectively.
A division of General Motors has notified the Company that it is
discontinuing all outsourcing of its wire harness requirements under contract
manufacturing arrangements. The Company believes that by mid 1999, the General
Motors division will produce in-house substantially all of its wire harness
requirements previously supplied by the Company. In 1998, the Company net
sales under this arrangement totaled approximately $841 million and contributed
approximately $49 million in operating income. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to offset reductions in its sales and operating profits
resulting from the reduction in sales to the General Motors division.

the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $11,779, $11,273 and
$8,686, respectively. Depreciable lives within each property classification are
as follows          Buildings and improvements          10--40 years
Machinery and equipment            5--10 years
Office furniture and fixtures         3--10 years

in thousands, except for share and per share data     Maintenance and repair expenditures that are not considered betterments
and do not extend the useful life of property are charged to expense as
incurred. Expenditures for improvements and major renewals are capitalized. When
assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on the
disposition is credited or charged to income.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair
market value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is being
amortized over 40 years on a straight-line basis. Other intangible assets are
being amortized over two to thirteen years on a straight-line basis. Goodwill
and other intangible asset amortization expense totaled approximately $1,453 1,495 and $1,180 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Accumulated amortization
as of December 31, 1998, and 1997 was $8,422 and $6,969, respectively. The
Company regularly evaluates its accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets. Impairment would be recognized when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Measurement of the amount of impairment will be based on appraisal, market value
of similar assets or estimated discounted future cash flows resulting from the
use and ultimate disposition of the asset.
Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities
Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following
at December 31 
1998       1997
Compensation-related obligations          $14,717     $11,699
Insurance-related obligations            7,241      3,491
Income Taxes                     2,012      5,812

Income Taxes
Prior to the initial public offering Offering discussed in Note 3,
the Company was an S corporation. As an S corporation, the Company profits
were taxed directly to its shareholders for federal income tax and certain state
income tax purposes. Certain state taxes were paid directly by the Company.
Concurrent with the Offering, the Company terminated its S corporation status.
The Company is subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.
The Company accounts for income taxes, using the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS 109, oAccounting for
Income Taxes.o Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future
years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent
that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.

STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
in thousands, except for share and per share data Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the local
currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using
exchange rates in effect at the period end for assets and liabilities and
average exchange rates during each reporting period for results of operations.
Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected as
accumulated other comprehensive income.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar
is the functional currency and which have certain transactions denominated in a
local currency are remeasured as if the functional currency were the U.S.
dollar. The remeasurement of local currencies into U.S. dollars creates
translation adjustments which are included in net income. All translation and
transaction activities were insignificant in 1998, 1997 and 1996.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point
of passage of title, which is generally at the time
of shipment.
Product Development Expenses
Expenses associated with the development of new products and changes to
existing products are charged to expense as incurred. The costs amounted to
$17,418, $14,114 and $9,263 in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, oAccounting for Stock Issued to Employeeso APB 25, and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25,
since the exercise price of employee share options equals the market price of
the shares on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. The
Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123, oAccounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.o
Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial Instruments
Financial instruments held by the Company include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and interest
rate swap agreements. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and payables is considered to be representative of fair value because
of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair values of borrowings under
the long-term debt facilities are based on rates available to the Company for
debt with comparable terms and maturities.
The interest rate swap agreements convert floating-rate debt under the
Company credit facility to fixed-rate debt. As the outstanding balance on the
Company credit facilities was less than the notional amount of the interest
rate swap agreements, the market value attributable to the difference was
recognized in interest expense in 1998 and 1997.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
in thousands, except for share and per share data Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
including certain self-insured risks and liabilities, and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Since actual results could differ from those estimates, the
Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes
available.
Accounting Standards
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 121
SFAS 121, oAccounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,o in 1996. SFAS 121 requires long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be reviewed for impairment
whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. The adoption of this Standard did not have an effect on the
Company financial statements. Management periodically reviews the
realizability of long-lived assets of the Company in accordance with SFAS 121.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 128
SFAS 128, oEarnings per Share,o in 1997. SFAS 128 requires the presentation of
basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per
share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing
net income by all weighted average dilutive potential common shares that were
outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities are not
significant and do not create differences between reported basic and diluted
earnings per share for all periods presented.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS 130, oReporting Comprehensive Incomeo. SFAS
130 establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
and its components. The adoption of SFAS 130 requires that certain items
including currency translation adjustments be included in other comprehensive
income, which prior to adoption were reported separately in shareholders'
equity. Prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
requirements of this statement.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131 SFAS 131, oDisclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.o SFAS 131 requires the financial statement
disclosures for operating segments, products and services, and geographic areas.
The Company operates in one business segment based on the criteria set forth in
SFAS 131. Therefore, SFAS 131 will not affect the Company financial position,
results of operations or financial statement disclosures.
The Company will be required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, oAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activitieso for its fiscal year ending 2000. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivatives and hedging activities. The Company has not
yet evaluated the financial accounting and reporting impact of SFAS 133.

On October 10, 1997, the Company completed its Offering of 6,727,500
Common Shares, resulting in net proceeds after deducting issuance costs of
$108,693. Net proceeds from the Offering were used to pay an $83,000 S
corporation distribution, and the remaining proceeds were used to repay net
borrowings under the credit facility discussed in Note 6. Concurrent with the
initial public offering, certain officers and management of the Company
purchased 510,181 Common Shares Management Reinvestment, resulting in net
proceeds of $8,326. In 1998, a final S corporation distribution of $2,600 was
paid.
In connection with the Offering, the Company amended its Articles of
Incorporation to change the authorized share capital of the Company from 37,724
shares of Class A Common, voting, without par value, and 87,276 shares of Class
B Common, non-voting, without par value, to 60,000,000 Common Shares, without
par value and 5,000,000 shares of voting preferred shares, without par value.
The amended Articles of Incorporation provided that each Class A Common Share
and Class B Common Share automatically became 1390856 Common Shares. All
applicable share and per share data have been adjusted accordingly in these
financial statements.
4.    Acquisitions
On December 31, 1998, the Company purchased all of the outstanding
common shares of Hi-Stat Manufacturing Co., Inc. Hi-Stat for approximately
$362,000. Hi-Stat manufactures engineered sensors, switches and solenoids for
the automotive industry. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase.
Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Hi-Stat are included
in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1998. The purchase price
was funded with the Company cash on hand and with proceeds from the credit
facilities discussed in Note 6. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
stated at fair value. The purchase price paid in excess of identifiable net
assets was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price has been allocated based 
on preliminary appraisals and evaluations and is subject to further review and 
refinement. The components of intangible assets included in the allocation of
purchase price, along with the related straight-line amortization periods, are                                   Amortization

In April 1996, the Company purchased 45% of the outstanding common
stock of Berifors AB Berifors, a Sweden-based manufacturer of electronic
instrumentation and information displays for the European truck and commercial
vehicle markets, for approximately $8,834. The investment was accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. The excess of the amount paid over the
book value of the assets acquired, totaling $7,200, is being amortized over 40
years on a straight-line basis. On October 10, 1997, the Company acquired the
remaining 55% of Berifors, in exchange for 757,063 Common Shares. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase. The excess of the purchase price
over the book value of assets acquired, totaling $10,439, is being amortized
over 40 years on a straight-line basis. The results of operations of Berifors
are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements from October 1997.
5. Investments
In October 1997, the Company purchased 50% of the outstanding common
stock of PST Industria Eletronica da Amazonia Ltda. PST, a Brazilian
electronic components business that specializes in electronic vehicle security
devices. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Total cash consideration paid by the Company with respect to this investment was
$17,722 including fees and expenses. The allocation of purchase price resulted
in intangibles, primarily non-compete covenants and goodwill of $2,000 and
$12,622, respectively, which are being amortized over periods of two to 40
years. Amortization expense was $1,190 and $469 in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the credit facility discussed
in Note 6. In 1998, the Company issued a $5,000 note to PST. The proceeds of the
note were used for the repayment of existing debt. The note is secured by
certain assets of PST.
In August 1997, the Company entered into two joint venture agreements
with Connecto AB, a Swedish manufacturer of power distribution systems. Pursuant
to the terms of the agreements, the Company expects to pay approximately $2,400
for a 60% interest in a Brazilian joint venture and $1,100 for a 40% interest in
a European joint venture. The Brazilian joint venture will be consolidated with
the results of the Company and the European joint venture will be accounted for
under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 1998, the Company
incurred costs of approximately $260 related to these joint ventures. The joint
ventures are establishing production facilities in Brazil and Europe for the
purpose of manufacturing and selling power distribution systems in South America
and Europe, respectively. In addition, the joint ventures will pursue sales and
marketing efforts for other products and services of joint venture partners to
the extent practicable. The Company finances its investments in the joint
ventures through borrowings under the credit facility discussed in Note 6.

The Company has a $425,000 credit agreement with a bank group. The
credit agreement has three components: a $100,000 revolving credit facility, a
$150,000 term facility and a $175,000 term facility. The $100,000 revolving
facility and the $150,000 term facility expire on December 31, 2003, and require
a commitment fee of 037% to 050% on the unused balance. Interest is payable
quarterly at either i the prime rate plus a margin of 25% to 150% or ii
LIBOR plus a margin of 175% to 300%, depending upon the Company ratio of
consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, as defined. The $175,000 term facility expires on
December 31, 2005. Interest is payable quarterly at either i the prime rate
plus a margin of 200% or ii LIBOR plus a margin of 350%.
The weighted average interest rate in effect for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was approximately 71%, 71% and 74 respectively, including the effects of the interest rate swap agreements.
Long-term debt consists of the following at December 31:
1998   1997  
Borrowings under credit facility        $342,150  $ 497

The credit agreement contains various covenants that require, among
other things, the maintenance of certain minimum amounts of consolidated net
worth and consolidated EBITDA and certain specified ratios of consolidated total
debt, to consolidated EBITDA, interest coverage and fixed charge coverage.
Restrictions may also include limits on capital expenditures and dividends. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1998.

The provision for income tax included in the accompanying financial
statements represents federal, state and foreign income taxes for fiscal 1998
and the period October 9, 1997, to December 31, 1997, and state income taxes for
certain states for the period January 1, 1997, to October 8, 1997 and fiscal
1996. The provision for income taxes consists of the following for the years
ended December 31:
1998   1997  1996
Current:             
Federal                  $20,414  $ 4,441  $        State and foreign              3,924   1,744   524

A reconciliation of the Company effective income tax rate to the
statutory federal tax rate for 1998 is as follows                                      1998
Statutory federal income tax rate               350%

Other items                          01
Effective income tax rate                   404%
A reconciliation of the Company effective income tax rate to the
statutory federal tax rate has been omitted for 1997 and 1996, as presentation
of such information is not meaningful.
Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are $878 as of December 31,
1998. Because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes. It is
impracticable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes with
respect to these earnings; however, foreign tax credits would be available to
reduce U.S. income taxes in the event of a distribution.
As a result of the Company conversion to C corporation status on
October 9, 1997, current deferred income tax assets and noncurrent deferred
income tax liabilities of approximately $4,073 and $2,906, respectively, were
recorded, offsetting a cumulative effect benefit of $1,167.
In conjunction with the acquisition of Hi-Stat on December 31, 1998,
the Company recorded deferred income tax assets and noncurrent deferred income
tax liabilities of approximately $4,172 and $5,072, respectively.

In March 1995, the Company granted 90,545 options to key executives to
purchase Common Shares at $482 per share. The options were vested upon grant,
and all options were exercised in June 1996.
In June 1996, the Company granted an additional 438,119 options to
directors and key executives to purchase Common Shares at $574 per share. The
options were exercised prior to the Offering. The Company recorded compensation
expense of $450 in 1997 and 1996, in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements relative to these options.
In October 1997, the Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan
Incentive Plan. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 Common Shares for issuance
under the Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, the Company granted options
to purchase 498,000 Common Shares to management with exercise prices equal to
the fair market value of the Company Common Shares at the date of grant. The
options will vest two years after the date of grant.
Information relating to the Company outstanding options is as
follows 
Shares   Average    Exercise

Of the outstanding options issued and outstanding under the Incentive
Plan, none are currently exercisable as of December 31, 1998.
The following pro forma information regarding net income and earnings
per share is required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its share options under the fair value method of that Statement.
The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions    Risk-free interest rate          597-616%  
Expected dividend yield             00%  
Expected lives               75 years  
Expected volatility              3319%  
32
STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
in thousands, except for share and per share data     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected share price
volatility. Because the Company share options have characteristics
significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its share options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The
Company pro forma net earnings per share were as follows 
1998   1997
Net income - as reported               $33,400 $46,964
Net income - pro forma                $31,236 $46,485
Basic and diluted earnings per share - as reported  $ 149 $ 292
Basic and diluted earnings per share - pro forma   $ 139 $ 289
10.   Employee Benefit Plans
The Company has certain defined contribution profit sharing and 401k
plans covering substantially all of the employees. Company contributions are
generally discretionary; however, a portion of these contributions are based
upon a percentage of employee compensation, as defined in the plans. The
Company policy is to fund all benefit costs accrued. There are no unfunded
prior service costs. For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
contributions amounted to $3,149, $3,274 and $2,481, respectively.
The Company does not provide any other material retirement,
postretirement or postemployment benefits to its employees.
11.   Related Party Transactions
In 1996, the Company sold a building to an affiliated entity for
$2,200. The excess of the sales price over the carrying value of the building
was $562 and was recorded as a capital contribution. During 1996, prior to the
sale of this building, the Company received approximately $235 in lease payments
and recognized related depreciation and interest expense totaling approximately
$108.
The Company provided management services to a related company in the
amount of $300 annually and also paid the salary of a certain key employee of
the related company, amounting to $76 and $180 in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Beginning on September 1, 1997, the salary payments were paid by the related
company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an obligation
to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
payables are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments. In management opinion, the estimated fair value
of the Company long-term debt approximates book value, as under the terms of
the borrowing arrangements, a significant portion of the obligations are subject
to fluctuating market rates of interest.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposures
to market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates. The Company does
not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes. Management believes
that its use of these instruments to reduce risk is in the Company best 
interest.
Derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 1998, and 1997, 
include the following interest rate swap agreements:
Notional Amount                Expected
1998     1997    Fixed Rate Paid   Maturity Date
20,000    20,000    6545-7795    Feb. 01, 1999
25,000    25,000     703-928    Aug 01, 1999
75,000     --      700-825    Dec. 29, 2000
75,000     --      700-825    Dec. 29, 2000
87,500     --       881     Dec. 31, 2001
87,500     --       881     Dec. 31, 2001
The fair market value of these interest rate swap agreements, which was
estimated based on quoted market sources and approximated a net payable of $220
and $157, at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay a fixed
interest rate to counterparties while receiving a floating interest rate based
on LIBOR. The fixed rate paid to the counterparties is dependent on the
Company ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined by
the Company $425,000 credit agreement discussed in Note 6. The counterparties
to each of the interest rate swap agreements are major commercial banks.
Management believes that losses related to credit risk are remote.
13.   Unaudited Pro Forma Information
The unaudited pro forma net income in the consolidated statements of
income for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, assumes that the Company
was subject to income taxes as a C corporation.
Unaudited pro forma net income per share for the years ended December
31, 1997 and 1996, has been calculated by dividing pro forma net income by the
weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding, the number of Common
Shares issued in connection with the Offering discussed in Note 3 6,727,500,
the number of Common Shares issued in connection with the exercise of share
options as discussed in Note 9 438,119, and the number of Common Shares issued
in connection with the Management Reinvestment discussed in Note 3 510,181.
