ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Our consolidated balance sheets as of December 29, 2001 and December 30,
2000 and the consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 29, 2001, together with the related notes and the report of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, are on the following pages.
Additional required financial information is described in Item 14.                    -36             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IRIDEX Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity, of cash flows,
and of comprehensive income loss present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of IRIDEX Corporation and its Subsidiaries the Company at
December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 and the results of their operations,
their cash flows, and of comprehensive income loss for each of the three years
in the period ended December 29, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index under 14a2
on page 59 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
Description of Business
IRIDEX Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of
semiconductor-based laser systems used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology
and skin afflictions in dermatology.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
invests primarily in money market funds and government paper; accordingly, these
investments are subject to minimal risks.
Available-for-Sale Securities
All marketable securities as of December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000
are considered to be available-for-sale and therefore are carried at fair value.
Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets when they have
scheduled maturities of less than one year. Available-for-sale securities are
classified as non current assets when they have scheduled maturities of more
than one year. Unrealized holding gains and losses on such securities are
reported net of related taxes as a separate component of stockholders' equity
until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are
reported in interest and other income and are computed using the specific
identification cost method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a
first-in, first-out FIFO method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by
considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and other
factors.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years.
Amortization of leasehold improvements and property and equipment is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related
assets, typically three years.                    -43     Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase
order and product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and
collection of the receivables is deemed probable. Up-front fees received in
connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated
product shipments. The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon
shipment of products in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies. Actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from
those accrued. The Company warranty policy is effective for shipped products
which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications. We
analyze historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer
demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales
returns allowance. Significant management judgements and estimates must be made
and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances
in any accounting period.
Research and Development
Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as
incurred.
Advertising
We expense advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expenses
for 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $408,000, $478,000 and $359,000, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Carrying amounts of our financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate fair values due to their short maturities. Estimated fair values for
available-for-sale securities, which are separately disclosed elsewhere, are
based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.                    -44     Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements in
accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to EmployeesAPB 25 and complies with the
disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationSFAS 123.
Under APB 25, compensation expense for grants to employees is based on
the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the
Company stock and the option exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a fair value
based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity
investment. The pro forma disclosure of the difference between compensation
expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value
method is presented in Note 6.
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than
Employees, or in Conjunction with Selling Good and Services, and Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock
Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plan FIN 28.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money market
accounts of three financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed
the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal risk.
We market our products to distributors and end-users throughout the
world. Sales to international distributors are generally made on open credit
terms and letter of credit. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.
Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses related to
individual customers or group of customers in any particular geographic area.
For the years ended December 29, 2001, December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000 no
customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenue. As of December 29, 2001,
December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000 no customer accounted for greater than 10%
of accounts receivable.
Our products require approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and
international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. Our future
products may not receive required approvals. If we were denied such approvals,
or if such approvals were delayed, it would have a materially adverse impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.                    -45     Reliance on Certain Suppliers
Certain components and services used by the Company to manufacture and
develop its products are presently available from only one or a limited number
of suppliers or vendors. The loss of any of these suppliers or vendors would
potentially require a significant level of hardware and/or software development
to incorporate the products or services into the Company products.
Use of Estimates
Management makes estimates and assumptions to prepare the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. As a result of Iridex disposal of it Laser
Research segment in 2001, the Company previously reported consolidated
financial statements for 2000 and 1999 have been reclassified to present the
discontinued Laser Research segment operations separate from continuing
operations. See Note 11.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year covers a 52 or 53 week period and ends on the Saturday
nearest December 31. Fiscal year 1999, 2000 and 2001 all included 52 weeks.
Net Income loss per Share
Basic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net
income loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net income
loss per share excludes potential common stock if their effect is
anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consists of incremental common shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
141 Business Combinations, which establishes financial accounting and
reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB Opinion No. 16, Business
Combinations, and FASB Statement No. 38, Accounting for Preacquisition
Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. It requires that all business
combinations in the scope of this Statement are to be accounted for using one
method, the purchase method. The provisions of this Statement apply to all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, and also applies to all
business combinations accounted for using the purchase method for which the date
of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. The Company believes that adoption of
the standard will not have a material effect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Company.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which establishes financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other                    -46 intangible assets and supercedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. It
addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be
accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition, after they have
been initially recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of this
Statement are effective starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001. The Company believes that SFAS No. 142 will not have a material effect on
the financial position or results of operation of the Company.
In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS
144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets that
develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of
by sales and requires long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by sales be
measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell.
Additionally, SFAS No. 144 expands the scope of discontinued operations to
include all components of an entity with operations that 1 can be
distinguished from the rest of the entity and 2 will be eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. SFAS No. 144
supercedes SFAS No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 144 applies to all long-lived assets including
discontinued operations and consequently amends Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 30 APB 30, Reporting Results of Operations Reporting the Effects
of Disposal of a segment of a business. Management does not expect the adoption
of SFAS 144 to have a material impact on the Company financial position and
results of operations.

Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be engaged in certain administrative
proceedings, incidental to its normal business activities. Management believes
that liabilities resulting from such proceedings, or claims which are pending or
known to be threatened, are adequately covered by liability insurance and will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations.
6.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize 2,000,000 shares of undesignated
preferred stock. Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. As of December 29, 2001, we had no preferred stock issued and
outstanding.
TREASURY STOCK
In December 1998, we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to
150,000 shares of our Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market. We
plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares for reissuance in connection with
our employee stock programs. We repurchased 76,000 shares of Common Stock for
$315,000 in 1999. In 2000, no shares of Common Stock were repurchased. In 2001,
we repurchased 27,000 shares of Common Stock for $115,000.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
Amended and Restated 1989 Incentive Stock Plan
The Amended and Restated 1989 Plan the 1989 Plan provided for the
grant of options and stock purchase rights to purchase shares of our Common
Stock to employees and consultants. The terms of the 1989 Plan, which expired in
August 1999, are substantially the same as the 1998 Plan described below.
1998 Stock Plan
The 1998 Stock Plan the 1998 Plan provides for the granting to
employees including officers and employee directors of incentive stock options
and for the granting to employees including officers and employee directors
and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights
SPRs. The exercise price of incentive stock options and SPRs granted under
the 1998 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares at
the time of grant. With respect to any recipient who owns stock possessing more
than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, the exercise
price of any option or SPR                    -49 granted must be at least equal to 110% of the fair market value at the time of
grant. Options granted under the 1998 Plan are exercisable at such times and
under such conditions as determined by the Administrator; generally over a four
year period. The maximum term of incentive stock options granted to any
recipient must not exceed ten years; provided, however, that the maximum term of
an incentive stock option granted to any recipient possessing more than 10% of
the voting power of our outstanding capital stock must not exceed five years. In
the case of SPRs, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, we have a
repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of
the purchaser employment with us for any reason including death or
disability. Such repurchase option lapses at a rate determined by the
Administrator. The purchase price for shares repurchased by us is the original
price paid by the purchaser. The form of consideration for exercising an option
or stock purchase right, including the method of payment, is determined by the
Administrator. The 1998 Plan expires in June 2008.
1995 Director Option Plan
In October 1995, we adopted the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director
Plan, under which members of the Board of Directors are granted options to
purchase 11,250 shares upon the first to occur of their appointment or the
adoption of the Director Plan First Option and an option to purchase 3,750
shares Subsequent Option on July 1 of each year thereafter provided that he
or she has served on the Board for at least the preceding six months. The
options granted are at fair market value on the date of grant. The First Option
becomes exercisable as to one-twelfth 1/12 of the shares subject to the First
Option for each quarter over a three-year period. Each Subsequent Option becomes
exercisable as to one-fourth 1/4 of the shares subject to the Subsequent
Option for each quarter, commencing one quarter after the First Option and any
previously granted Subsequent Options have become fully exercisable. Options
granted under the Director Plan have a term of 10 years.
In the event of our merger with or into another corporation, resulting
in a change of control, or the sale of substantially all of our assets, each
Director Plan option becomes exercisable in full and shall be exercisable for 30
days after written notice to the holder of the event causing the change in
control.
Unless terminated sooner, the Director Plan will terminate in 2005. The
Board has authority to amend or terminate the Director Plan, provided no such
amendment may impair the rights of any optionee without the optionee consent.
1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors in October 1995. On April 28, 1997, the shareholders
approved an amendment to increase the total number of shares of common stock for
issuance under the Purchase Plan from 50,000 to 100,000. The Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees including officers and employee directors to
purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 10% of an
employee compensation. No employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of
stock in any calendar year or more than 1,000 shares of Common Stock in any
twelve-month period. The price of shares purchased under the Purchase Plan is
85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock at the beginning
of the offering period or the end of the offering period. The Purchase Plan will
terminate in 2005, unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors.                    -50     Information with respect to activity under these option plans are set

At December 30, 2000 and January 1, 2000 options to purchase 762,123 and 624,025
shares of Common Stock were exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of
$429 and $353, respectively.                    -51     The following information concerning our stock option and employee stock
purchase plans is provided in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. We account for such plans in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board No. 25 and related Interpretations.
The fair value of each option grant has been estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions                    2001        2000         1999

behavior of each group. Group A represents officers and directors who are a
smaller group holding a greater average number of options than other option
holders and who tend to exercise later in the vesting period. Group B are all
other option holders, virtually all of whom are employees. This group tends to
exercise earlier in the vesting period.
The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of those options
granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $282, $596 and $337, respectively.
We have also estimated the fair value for the purchase rights issued
under our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under the Black-Scholes valuation
model using the following assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999                    2001       2000       1999

We have a plan known as the IRIS Medical Instruments 401k trust to
provide retirement benefits through the deferred salary deductions for
substantially all employees. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their annual
compensation to the plan, limited to a maximum amount set by the Internal
Revenue Service. The plan also provides for Company contributions at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. On April 1, 2000 the Company commenced a
Company match for the 401k in the amount of 50% of employee contributions up
to an annual maximum of $1,000 per year. The Company contributions in fiscal
2001 totaled $99,000. The Company contributions in fiscal 2000 totaled $64,000.
No contributions were made in fiscal 1999.

During 2000 and 1999, there were 62,930, and 431,077 outstanding options to
purchase shares, respectively, at a weighted average exercise price of $982,
and $528 per share, respectively, were not included in the computations of
diluted net income per common share since, in each, case the exercise price of
the common shares exceeded the market price of the related options. During 2001,
options to purchase 1,656,817 shares at a weighted average exercise price of
$534 were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted net
loss per common share because their effect was antidilutive. These options could
dilute earnings per share in future periods.

12.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In April 2001, we discontinued our Laser Research segment. In the first
quarter of 2001, we recorded a loss of $893,000 net of a $542,000 tax benefit.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, we adjusted the loss on discontinued operations
to $672,000 net of a $439,000 tax benefit. Revenues for                    -56 this segment were $599,000 for 2000 and $460,000 for 1999. Costs and operating
expenses of the Laser Research segment were $132,000 for 2000 and $209,000 for
1999. Sales, general and administrative costs and indirect costs of
manufacturing historically were not allocated to the Laser Research segment.
12.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On January 13, 2002 a customer announced that the phase III clinical
trial of SnET2, a photodynamic drug activated by the OcuLight 664 laser system
for use in the treatment of wet AMD, did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint
of the study. As a result, the Company included a pretax charge in the fourth
quarter to cost of sales of $287,000 to reserve inventory associated with the
OcuLight 664 system.
