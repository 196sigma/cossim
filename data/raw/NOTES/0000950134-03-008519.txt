Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  48                     42              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TALX Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TALX
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
March 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TALX
Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2002 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended March 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
April 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets and as discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective April 1, 2000, the Company changed its method of
accounting for revenue recognition.

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We are the leading provider of automated employment and income verification
and unemployment cost management services and a leader in providing outsourced
employee self-service applications. Our services enable mortgage lenders,
pre-employment screening companies, employers and other authorized users to
obtain employee human resources and payroll information. We also provide
unemployment insurance claims processing and unemployment tax planning and
management to a broad range of employers. Further, we allow employees to review
and modify information in human resources and payroll management information
systems without requiring employer assistance.
Our services and software use interactive web and interactive voice
response software, fax and other technologies and are designed to enhance
service levels, improve productivity and reduce costs by automating historically
labor intensive, paper-based processes and enabling users to perform
self-service transactions. We typically serve large organizations, including
approximately two-thirds of the Fortune 500 and a number of federal, state and
local government agencies.
b PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TALX
Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
c CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
d ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
We evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a
combination of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may
impair a specific customer ability to meet its financial obligations, we
record a specific allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the net
recognized receivable i.e., net of deferred revenue to the amount we
reasonably believe will be collected. For the remaining customers, we recognize
allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the aggregate
receivables are outstanding, the current business environment and historical
experience.
e PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is computed using straight-line and accelerated
methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
useful life of the asset or lease term.
f PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Product development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Software
development costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is
achieved, after which they are capitalized on a product-by-product basis.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs is computed using the
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product,
which is typically three years. Amortization of capitalized software development
costs starts when the product is available for general release to clients.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
g GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
We have adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as of
April 1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be
used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no
longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. SFAS
No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be
amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated
residual values.
h REVENUE RECOGNITION, WORK IN PROGRESS AND DEFERRED REVENUE
Revenues from The Work Number are recognized in the period that they are
earned, from transaction fees charged to users for verifications of employment
history and income. Additionally, revenue for set up fees, monthly maintenance
and employer conversion fees are recognized on a straight-line basis from the
time the service is available to be used by our clients through the end of the
service period. Revenues from our unemployment cost management services, called
UC eXpress, are recognized in the period that they are earned, evenly over the
life of the contract. Transaction fees are recorded as the services are
provided. Revenue which is contingent upon achieving certain performance
criteria is recognized when those criteria are met. Human resources and benefits
application services revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis from the
time the service is available to be used by our clients through the end of the
service period. Because of seasonal variations of our service offerings, a
greater number of clients have services available to them from October through
December than during any other period during the year. As a result, revenues in
our third fiscal quarter are substantially higher than in the other three
quarters of the year. Historically, over fifty percent of annual revenues in
this revenue line have been recorded in the third quarter. We recognize hardware
and software license revenue upon shipment based on vendor-specific objective
evidence. Revenues for customization services of customer premises systems are
recognized by the contract method of accounting using percentage of completion
for larger, more complex systems and the completed contract method for smaller
systems. Revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably
over the maintenance period. Deferred revenue represents the unearned portion of
The Work Number setup fees, as well as, Human Resources and Benefits Application
Services, UC eXpress and maintenance fees. Commissions paid are deferred and
expensed over the related service period.
i CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
We sell our services and software in a variety of industries. No client
represented over 10% of revenues in fiscal 2001, 2002 or 2003. We perform
periodic credit evaluations of our clients' financial condition and generally do
not require collateral; however, for our maintenance business we maintain a
security interest in hardware until payment is received. Credit losses from
clients have been within management expectations, and management believes the
allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for any expected losses.
j INCOME TAXES
We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

k FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments. A
financial instrument is defined as cash or a contract that both imposes on one
entity a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial instrument
to a second entity and conveys to that second entity a contractual right to
receive cash or another financial instrument from the first entity. Our
financial instruments include long-term debt and a revolving line of credit
facility. The carrying value of these commitments approximate fair value due to
their stated interest rates approximating market rates. These estimated fair
value amounts have been determined using available market information or other
appropriate valuation methodologies.
l DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We use interest rate swap agreements as required under the terms of our
term loan and revolving credit facility see note 7. Our policy is to manage
interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate
swap agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an
agreed-upon notional principal amount. We do not hold or issue any derivative
financial instruments for trading purposes.
m STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
We have historically accounted for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.
Since all of our options are granted with an option price equal to the
market price at the time of grant, we have not recognized any stock-based
employee compensation cost under our stock option plans. SFAS No. 123 requires
pro forma disclosure of the impact on earnings as if the compensation expense
for these plans had been determined using the fair value method. Compensation
cost is calculated under a straight line basis. The following table presents our
net earnings and earnings per share as reported and the pro forma amounts that
would have been reported using the fair value method under SFAS 123 for the
years presented                                   MARCH 31,

TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options under
SFAS No. 123 was not reflected in the determination of the impact, because
compensation cost is reflected over the options' vesting period of six to ten
years and compensation cost for options granted prior to April 1, 1995 is not
considered. The fair value of option grants for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 is
estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected volatility of 62%, 59%
and 80% in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively; risk-free interest rate of
491%, 481% and 350% in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively; expected
life of 50, 50 and 75 years in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively; and
an expected dividend yield of 350%, 350% and 120% in fiscal 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively.
n MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates.
o LITIGATION
We have legal contingencies that have a high degree of uncertainty. As
described in Note 17, certain allegations have been made against us. We believe
that liabilities for many of these matters are either not probable or not
estimable and therefore, no reserves have been established for those matters.
When a contingency becomes probable and estimable a reserve is established. We
have established reserves for certain other matters. If these matters are
resolved unfavorably, they could have a significant impact on our future results
and liquidity. Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
p EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of
all employee stock options and warrants that would have had a dilutive effect on
earnings per share. The weighted average number of shares is based on common
stock outstanding for basic earnings per share and common stock outstanding and
common stock options and warrants for diluted earnings per share in periods when
such common stock options and warrants are not antidilutive. All weighted
average share amounts include the effect of all stock dividends and splits.
q RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain balances in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform to
the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year.

In connection with the acquisitions of Ti3, Inc.; the unemployment cost
management services business of Gates, McDonald & Company, a subsidiary of
Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company; and James E. Frick, Inc., d/b/a The Frick
Company, TALX acquired certain identifiable intangible assets. These assets were
recorded in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations.
Effective April 1, 2002, we have adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired
outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides that
intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized, but will rather
be tested at least annually for impairment. Under the provisions of SFAS No.
142, any impairment loss identified upon adoption of this standard will be
recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Goodwill
and intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life that are
acquired in purchase business combinations will not be amortized, but instead
tested for impairment on an annual basis. Through the use of an independent
business appraiser, we reviewed our goodwill and intangible assets as of
December 31, 2002 and determined that no impairment existed.
The following table summarizes goodwill and other intangible asset activity
for years ended March 31, 2002 and 2003 dollars in thousands.                                  OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

In connection with the acquisitions of The Frick Company and the GM
Unemployment Compensation Business, on March 27, 2002, pursuant to a loan
agreement dated as of March 27, 2002, the Loan Agreement, we obtained
secured financing consisting of a $30,000,000 term loan the Term Loan and a
$10,000,000 revolving credit facility the Revolving Credit Facility from
LaSalle Bank National Association, as administrative agent and lender, and
Southwest Bank of St. Louis, as lender, and any other lenders that may become
party to the Loan Agreement collectively, the Lenders. We used the proceeds
of the Term Loan to pay a portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions;
however, we have not borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility. We must repay
principal of the Term Loan in quarterly installments, with the
54
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
final installment due on February 27, 2005. In addition, principal payments are
required out of excess cash flow. The Revolving Credit Facility also matures on
February 27, 2005.
The Term Loan and advances under the Revolving Credit Facility bear
interest at rates we select under the terms of the Loan Agreement, including a
base rate or eurodollar rate, plus an applicable margin. Until March 27, 2003,
eurodollar rate loans bore interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus 225%
and base rate loans bore interest at the applicable base rate plus 000%.
Commencing March 28, 2003, the applicable margin for eurodollar rate loans
varies from 200% to 225%, and the applicable margin for base rate loans
remains at 000%, in each case based upon our ratio of total indebtedness to
EBITDA. We may make prepayments under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit
Facility without penalty. In addition, if William W. Canfield ceases serving as
our chief executive officer during the first 24 months after closing, and we do
not retain a substitute satisfactory to the Lenders within 120 days, then we are
required to repay all outstanding loans Term Loan and Revolving Credit
Facility.
The Loan Agreement is secured by security interests in substantially all
the assets of us and of our three subsidiaries Ti3, Garcia and Frick, the
guarantees of our three subsidiaries, and a pledge of the stock of each of those
subsidiaries.
The Loan Agreement includes certain covenants, including, without
limitation, restrictions on the use of proceeds of the Term Loan and loans made
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan was to be used solely to pay
a portion of the purchase price for the acquisitions of the The Frick Company
and the GM Unemployment Compensation Business. The proceeds of loans made under
the Revolving Credit Facility may be used solely for working capital, permitted
capital expenditures, as the source for payment of our obligations with respect
to certain existing letters of credit, to pay the transaction cost of the Loan
Agreement, and to finance certain permitted acquisitions. The Loan Agreement
also requires compliance with certain financial covenants based on our minimum
net worth, minimum EBITDA, our ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA and our
ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges. The Loan Agreement further requires compliance
with certain operating and other covenants which limit, among other things, the
incurrence of additional indebtedness by us and our subsidiaries, the amount of
capital expenditures to be made by us and our subsidiaries, sales of assets and
mergers and dissolutions, impose restrictions on distributions to shareholders,
change of control of TALX, investments, acquisitions and liens, and which
require compliance, in all material respects, with material laws. The Loan
Agreement generally prohibits the payment of cash dividends, except for cash
dividends not in excess of $25 million per fiscal year so long as we are not in
default at the time of the declaration. The Loan Agreement also contains various
representations and warranties, including among other things, the accuracy of
financial statements and other information delivered to the Lenders, the absence
of changes which would have or would reasonably be likely to have a material
adverse effect as customarily included in secured credit facilities of this
nature.
On January 27, 2003, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement.
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, James E. Frick, Inc., Garcia Acquisition Sub,
Inc. and Ti3, Inc., consented to the amendment as guarantors. Among other
things, the amendment modified the minimum EBITDA covenant for the fiscal
quarters ending March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003 contained
in the Loan Agreement. In addition, we obtained from the Lenders a waiver of our
violation of the minimum EBITDA covenant for the quarter ended December 31,
2002. At March 31, 2003, we believe we were in material compliance with all
financial covenants under the Loan Agreement.
At March 31, 2003 our outstanding borrowings carried an interest rate of
354%.
Scheduled minimum long-term debt repayments are $10 million and $12 million
in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, respectively. Payments are due in equal quarterly
amounts. We may accelerate credit facility repayments, depending on available
operating cash flow.

8 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT
On March 27, 2002, we entered into the Term Loan which accrues interest
based upon certain LIBOR indexes and will amortize over three years with a
maturity of February 27, 2005. As a condition of the Term Loan Agreement, we
were required to enter into a hedge contract for 50% of our outstanding term
loan as a means of reducing our interest rate exposure. Pursuant to this
requirement, we entered into an interest rate swap contract on June 26, 2002 for
a notional amount of $14 million, which represented 50% of our outstanding term
loan balance on that date. Under this contract, we pay a fixed rate of 345% and
receive a variable rate of LIBOR, which is equal to the LIBOR rate utilized on
our term loan. The notional amount of our interest rate swap contract steps down
according to the same schedule as our term loan, maintaining a 50% hedged
position. All payment dates and maturity dates are the same as our term loan.
This strategy effectively converts 50% of our term loan into a fixed rate
instrument.
The interest rate swap and related gains and losses arising on the contract
are accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities. Specifically, changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges are deferred and recorded in other
comprehensive income. These deferred gains or losses are recognized in income
when the transactions being hedged are completed.
As of March 31, 2003, the fair value of the interest rate swap in the
amount of $256,000 is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.
Interest expense accrued on the swap contract was $175,000 for the year ended
March 31, 2003.
We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
9 LEASES
We have non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office space and
office equipment, that expire through fiscal 2009. Total rent expense for
operating leases was $1,360,000, $1,494,000 and $5,021,000 in 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively.
Amortization expense associated with assets acquired under capital leases
is included in total depreciation and amortization expense.

A net operating loss carryforward of approximately $600,000 is available to

This net operating loss carryforward was acquired as part of our 2002
acquisitions.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
periods in which the
58
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than
not we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
11 RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGE
During the quarter ended September 30, 2001, we reorganized our sales and
delivery operations and refocused our product lines related to our human
resources and benefit applications and customer premises systems businesses. In
conjunction with the reorganization, we reduced our workforce by approximately
17%, closed certain regional sales offices and wrote-down hardware inventory and
capitalized software. As a result of these actions, we incurred restructuring
charges of $19 million associated with the write-off of capitalized software 349,000 related to employee severance costs and $337,000 related to office
closing costs. These items are reflected in the line item restructuring charge
on the statement of earnings and $240,000 and $139,000 is reflected in accrued
expenses on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively.
Additionally, we incurred a charge of $307,000 related to the write-down of
certain hardware inventory items. This charge is reflected as a separate
component of cost of goods sold on the statement of earnings for the year ended
March 31, 2002.

In May 1999, we entered into an agreement with a third party, under which
they provide us with strategic advisory services, including in connection with
our acquisition of Ti3. Pursuant to that agreement, we issued them warrants to
purchase a total of 45,375 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
$482 per share. All 45,375 warrants are outstanding and exercisable at March
31, 2003.
During fiscal 1997, shareholders approved the TALX Corporation 1996
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which was amended in 1998 and 2000 and
amended and restated in 2001. The ESPP allows eligible employees the right to
purchase common stock on a quarterly basis at the lower of 85% of the market
price at the beginning or end of each three-month offering period. Of the
907,500 shares of common stock shares reserved for the ESPP, there were 464,106
shares remaining at March 31, 2003.

In November 2000, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to
400,000 shares of our stock in the open market, or through privately negotiated
transactions over the following two-year period. In November 2001, this plan was
extended to November 2004, and the number of shares was increased to one
million. Under this plan, we repurchased 311,000 shares during the year ended
March 31, 2003. Cumulative shares repurchased under this plan amount to 608,500.
Share amounts are reported on a pre-dividend basis. On September 5, 2002, our
board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan, authorizing us to
repurchase up to one million shares during the 36 month period ending September
30, 2005, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of March 31, 2003,
175,000 shares have been repurchased under this plan. Except for the 409,231
shares remaining in the treasury at March 31, 2003, all shares repurchased have
been reissued in connection with employee stock option exercises and employee
stock purchase plan purchases.
During fiscal 2001, we began paying dividends on our common stock on a
quarterly basis. Dividends of $008, $012 and $013 per share were declared and
dividends of $005, $012 and $012 per share were paid to shareholders during
fiscal years 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Any future determination to pay
dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend
upon our earnings, capital requirements and operating and financial condition
and such other factors as the board may deem relevant.
13 BUSINESS SEGMENTS
FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, requires companies to provide certain information about
their operating segments. Prior to our acquisitions in March 2002, we only had
one reportable segment. Effective March 27, 2003, we had two reportable
segments: Payroll-Based Services and Software and Unemployment Cost Management
Services.
Payroll-Based Services and Software: This segment includes the following   - The Work Number Services -- The Work NumberR, W-2 eXpressSM, ePayroll
and FasTimeR   - Human Resources and Benefits Application Services; and
- Customer Premises Systems and Related Maintenance and Support
Unemployment Cost Management Services: This segment includes our UC
eXpressSM services suite.
For the year ended March 31, 2002, we allocated goodwill and intangible
assets to the appropriate segments. All interest income and expense, debt and
executive overhead expenses were included in the Payroll-Based Services and
Software segment.
For the year ended March 31, 2003, the following items are not reported on
an operating segment basis and are included in the following table in the
column entitled Unallocated because they are not considered in the
performance evaluation by our chief operating decision-maker, our chairman and

Effective March 31, 2000, we sold all of the assets, net of liabilities, of
the database services business to WPZ Holdings, Inc., the parent company of one
of the division largest customers. The sales price was $1,273,000, which
represented the current book value of the net assets sold. We realized pre-tax
and after-tax gains of $187,000 and $117,000, respectively. While the effective
date of the transaction was March 31, 2000, cash settlement occurred April 5,
2000.
During the quarter ended September 30, 2000, we concluded all
transition-related activity for the database services business. Completing this
transition ahead of schedule resulted in a savings of $61,000 of the transition
reserve. Therefore, we realized pre-tax and after-tax gains of $61,000 and
$37,000, respectively.
The results of operations for the database business for the year ended
March 31, 2001 included a gain on disposal of $61,000, income taxes of $24,000
and net earnings of $36,000. There were no results of operations for the years
ended March 31, 2002 and 2003. As of March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 there were no
assets or liabilities related to the database business on the balance sheets.
15 DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts for our cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses and income
taxes payable approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt and borrowings under our
revolving line of credit facility approximate fair value due to their stated
interest rates approximating market rates.
62
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
These estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market
information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.
16 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
We sponsor a profit-sharing/401k plan. The plan covers substantially all
of our employees. We make contributions to the plan, subject to ERISA
limitations, up to 24% of employees' earnings. Total expense under the plan for
the years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 was $305,000, $322,000 and
$762,000, respectively.
17 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits. Except to the extent
described below, based on information currently available, we believe that no
current proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material
adverse effect upon us.
On December 26, 2001, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri Civil Action
No. 4:01CV02014DJS by Matt L. Brody, an alleged shareholder of the Company,
against the Company, certain of its executive officers and directors William W.
Canfield, Craig N. Cohen and Richard F. Ford collectively, the Individual
Defendants, and two underwriters Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and
A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. in the Company August 2001 secondary common stock
offering Secondary Offering. The case purportedly is brought on behalf of
all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of our common stock
between July 18, 2001 and October 1, 2001 Putative Class Period, including
as part of the Secondary Offering. The complaint alleges, among other things,
that certain statements in the registration statement and prospectus for the
Secondary Offering, as well as other statements made by the Company and/or the
Individual Defendants during the Putative Class Period, were materially false
and misleading because they allegedly did not properly account for certain
software and inventory, did not reflect certain write-offs, and did not
accurately disclose certain business prospects. The complaint alleges violations
of Sections 10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 promulgated thereunder against the Company and the Individual Defendants,
violations of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the Company, the
Individual Defendants and the underwriters, and violation of Section 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 against Mr. Canfield.
Three additional purported class action lawsuits were filed in the same
court, against the same defendants and making substantially the same
allegations: on January 8, 2002 by Donald Metzger Civil Action No.
4:02CV00031DJS; on January 9, 2002 by Anna Goodman Civil Action No.
4:02CV00033DJS; and on January 30, 2002 by Al Hinton Civil Action No.
4:02CV00168DJS each of whom allegedly were shareholders of the Company during
the Putative Class Period. On February 15, 2002, these three lawsuits were
consolidated with and into the Brody lawsuit Civil Action No. 4:01CV02014DJS
for all purposes. In October 2002, the case was transferred from the Honorable
Donald J. Stohr, United States District Judge, to the Honorable Henry E. Audrey,
United States District Judge.
The consolidated lawsuit seeks, among other things, an award of unspecified
money damages, including interest, for all losses and injuries allegedly
suffered by the putative class members as a result of the defendants' alleged
conduct and unspecified equitable/injunctive relief as the Court deems proper.
On May 20, 2002, the Company and the Individual Defendants filed a motion
to dismiss the lawsuits, and the underwriter defendants filed a separate motion
to dismiss. On March 31, 2003, the Court granted defendants' motion in part,
dismissing plaintiffs' claims under Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule
10b-5 thereunder, without prejudice. The Court granted plaintiffs sixty
additional days to file an
63
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
amended consolidated complaint, and defendants sixty days thereafter to respond
to the amended complaint. No amended complaint has been filed to date.
We believe the plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intend to defend
vigorously against them. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of
litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation.
An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
As previously disclosed, the Securities and Exchange Commission initially
commenced an investigation into our second fiscal quarter 2001 financial
results. We are cooperating fully with the investigation. On November 12, 2002,
the staff of the Central Regional Office of the Commission sent us a Wells
letter indicating the staff plans to recommend to the Commission that it
institute an enforcement action against us and two of our executive officers,
William Canfield and Craig Cohen, related to two matters, and requesting that we
and such executive officers submit responses to the letter. The Wells letter
states that the SEC staff will allege, among other things, that our financial
statements were misleading as a result of capitalizing instead of expensing $16
million related to a patent technology license agreement executed in March 2001
and expensing approximately $158,000 in bonus payments to executive officers in
the first quarter of fiscal 2002 instead of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001.
Those items are among those that are the subject of the restatement as disclosed
on our Form 10-K/A for the year ended March 31, 2002. The remedies the
Commission may consider include an injunction against us and the individuals
and, if appropriate, an officer and director bar and disgorgement and civil
money penalties against the individuals. The Company and the individuals have
filed separate written responses to the Wells letter setting forth the reasons
why the proposed enforcement action should not be instituted by the Commission.
As described above, we have filed restated financial statements for each of
the quarters ended June 30, 2000 through June 30, 2002 and for the fiscal years
ended March 31, 2001 and 2002. As a result of the restatement, we could become
subject to additional litigation or regulatory proceedings or both. As of the
date hereof, we are not aware of any litigation having been commenced against us
related to this restatement. However, such litigation could be commenced against
us in the future and the plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits against us
previously could amend their complaints to include claims related to this
restatement, and if so, we could not predict the outcome of any such litigation
at this time. Additionally, the lenders under our March 27, 2002 Loan Agreement,
which is described more fully below under Management Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital
Resources, could seek to exercise remedies which may be available to them, such
as acceleration of our loan, in the event they determine that, as a result of
the restatement discussed above or the SEC investigation discussed below, we
have breached a covenant or representation and warranty in the Loan Agreement.
If an unfavorable result occurred in any such action, our business and financial
conditions could be harmed.
As of the date hereof, the SEC is investigating our accounting for certain
items, including those which were the subject of the restatement. At this time,
we cannot predict whether or not any additional regulatory investigation related
to this restatement or any other matter will be commenced, or if it is, the
outcome of any such investigation. However, if any such investigation were to
result in a regulatory proceeding or action against us, our business and
financial condition could be harmed.
Additionally, we are required to indemnify each of the Individual
Defendants, as officers and/or directors of the Company, in connection with the
above matters, provided they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company. Stifel,
Nicolaus & Company and A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. have made demands on the
Company to indemnify them in connection with these matters.
Our directors and officers liability insurance carriers have received
notice of the consolidated litigation and SEC investigation.
64
TALX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceeding,
litigation and regulatory proceedings of this type are expensive and will
require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend these
proceedings.
18 SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION
Cash paid during the year for interest totaled $0, $0 and $13 million for
the years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Cash paid during
the year for income taxes totaled $27 million, $10 million and $25 million
for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.
19 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION
James W. Canfield, the son of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed in a non-executive position with our Company as the manager
of ePayroll business development. Mr. Canfield has a current annual salary of
$95,000 and is eligible for a bonus of approximately $19,000 based upon certain
performance goals. This bonus can decrease or increase based on the percentage
achievement of these performance goals. Mr. Canfield is also eligible annually
for an award of 2,500 stock options. Both the bonus and stock option awards are
granted under standard corporate compensation plans and are consistent with
payments made to managers at Mr. Canfield level. For fiscal 2003, Mr. Canfield
received $91,350 in salary, $12,800 in bonus, and 2,500 stock options for his
services to the Company.
20 CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE
During 2001, we changed our method of accounting for certain service
transactions in the Human Resources and Benefits Application Services and The
Work Number Services revenue lines to be in accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 101. We also considered recent guidance from the SEC staff
concerning the accounting for these types of service transactions. This guidance
requires revenues to be recognized on a straight-line basis from the time the
service is available for use by our clients through the end of the service
period. Previously, we had consistently recorded revenues as services were
provided. We have retroactively adopted SAB 101 as of April 1, 2000, and have
recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $17 million, net of tax of $11
million, in fiscal 2001 to reflect the application of the new accounting. The
cumulative effect adjustment was computed based on revenue of $29 million, and
related commission expense of $175,000, initially recognized in 2000 and prior
years that was delayed to 2001 and future periods under SAB 101.
21 SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On April 22, 2003 we sold substantially all of the assets of our human
resources and benefits application services business to Workscape, Inc., a
Framingham, Massachusetts-based provider of benefits and workforce management
solutions. The primary product of this line of services, the benefits enrollment
business, provides a customized solution for clients' employees to enroll in an
employer benefits programs and make changes to their personal information and
benefits elections, all by means of the Internet or by telephone.
The transaction is structured as a transfer of assets under contract for
sale with no initial down-payment and the purchase price to be paid over a
three-year period, based on a client retention formula. Proceeds are anticipated
to be between $2 million and $6 million, with no minimum guaranteed amount. We
will record cash received under the asset purchase agreement first to reduce the
recorded value of net assets sold under the agreement and then to reflect gain
on the sale of the business. In connection with the sale, we will provide
Workscape, Inc., for agreed upon fees, with various transition services related
to the operation of the benefits enrollment business until December 31, 2005, or
until certain transferred client contracts have expired or been terminated.
Workscape, Inc. has hired all of the employees related to the benefits
enrollment business.
