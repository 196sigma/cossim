Stockholders
Canterbury Park Holding
Corporation We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Canterbury Park Holding Corporation
a Minnesota corporation as of December31, 2009, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
the year ended December31, 2009.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Canterbury Park
Holding Corporation as of December31, 2009, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Grant Thornton LLP

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND
2008 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Business Canterbury Park Holding Corporation
was incorporated on March24, 1994.
On March29, 1994, the Company acquired all the outstanding
securities of Jacobs Realty,Inc. JRI from Irwin Jacobs and IMR Fund,
L.P. an investment fund for various pension plans and trusts. JRI was merged into the Company, and the
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting whereby
the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at the Companys
cost. The primary asset of JRI was
Canterbury Downs Racetrack and the 325 acres of surrounding land. On May20,
1994, the Company adopted a plan of Reorganization pursuant to which the sole
shareholder of Canterbury Park Concessions,Inc. CPC, and majority
shareholder of the Company, agreed to exchange his shares of CPC stock for
198,888 shares of the Companys common stock concurrent with the closing of a
public offering. Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, CPC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in August1994
when the Company completed the initial public offering of its common
stock. This reorganization was treated
in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
Net proceeds received by the Company from the public offering were
approximately $4,847,000, which along with additional borrowings under the
Companys line of credit with the majority shareholder, were used to pay off
the remaining notes payable from the acquisition of JRI. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company, CPC and Shakopee
Valley RV Park Acquisition Company, LLC after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions. Presentation
The
Consolidated Statement of Operations, Consolidated Statement of Changes in
Stockholders Equity, and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows from the
prior-period have been conformed to the 2009 presentation. This
presentation change and certain reclassifications in the footnotes had no
effect on net income, earnings per share, or stockholders equity. Revenue
Recognition Our revenues are derived primarily from the operations of
a card room, pari-mutuel wagering on simulcast and live horse races, concession
sales, and related activities.
Collection revenue from card room operations, a set percentage of
wagers, is recognized at the time that the wagering process is complete. Pari-mutuel revenues are recognized upon
occurrence of the live race that is presented for wagering and after that live
race is made official by the respective states racing regulatory body. Revenues related to concession and
publication sales and parking and admission fees are recognized as revenue when
the service has been performed or the product has been delivered. Estimates The preparation of the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from these estimates. Restricted
Cash Restricted
cash represents refundable deposits and amounts due to horsemen for purses,
stakes and awards, and amounts accumulated in card game progressive jackpot
pools, the Player Pool and Poker Promotional Fund to be used to repay card
players in the form of promotions, giveaways, prizes, or by other means. Uncashed
Winning Tickets The
Company records a liability for winning tickets upon the completion of a
race. As winning tickets are redeemed,
this liability is reduced for the respective cash payment. 35 Table of
Contents We recognize
revenue associated with the uncashed winning tickets when the likelihood of the
redemption of the winning ticket is remote. Promotional Allowances The Company
offers certain promotional allowances at no charge to patrons who participate
in our player rewards program. The
retail value of these promotional items is shown as a deduction from total
revenues on the Companys consolidated statements of operations. Due to
Minnesota Horsemens Benevolent and Protective Association,Inc. MHBPA The Minnesota Pari-Mutuel Horse Racing
Act specifies that the Company is required to segregate a portion of funds
recorded as purse expense in the statements of operations, received from card
room operations and wagering on simulcast and live horse races, for future
payment as purses for live horse races or other uses of the horsepersons
associations. Pursuant to an agreement
with the MHBPA, the Company has transferred into a trust account or paid
directly to the MHBPA, approximately $5,525,000 and $6,534,000 for the years
ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to thoroughbred
races. Minnesota Statutes specify that
amounts transferred into the trust account are the property of the trust and
not of the Company. The interest rate on
any purses accrued but not transferred into the trust was 450% on both December31,
2009 and December31, 2008. Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets Management of the Company periodically reviews the carrying value of
property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value
of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows. Should the sum of the related expected future
net cash flows be less than the carrying value, management will determine
whether an impairment loss should be recognized. An impairment loss would be measured by the
amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset. To date, management has
determined that no impairment of these assets exists. Land,
Buildings, and Equipment Land, buildings, equipment, and building improvements are
capitalized at a level of $1,000 or greater and are recorded at cost. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to
operations when incurred. Furniture,
fixtures, and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives ranging from 5 7 years, while buildings are
depreciated over 15 39 years. Building
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the useful life
of the assets. Card
RoomAccruals Minnesota law allows
the Company to collect amounts from patrons to fund progressive jackpot pools
in the card room. These amounts, along
with amounts earned by the player pool, promotional pools and the outstanding
chip liability, are accrued as short-term liabilities at each balance sheet
date. Income
Taxes Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to
reverse. We have adopted the
provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC
740. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial
statements and also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 740
provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The adoption of ASC 740 had no effect on the
amounts previously recognized for income taxes. Interest
and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions are presented in
income tax expense. During the twelve months
ended December31, 2009, we have not recognized expense for 36 Table of Contents interest and penalties
and do not have any amounts accrued at December31, 2009 and December31,
2008 respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties. Net
Income Per Share 
Basic net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year.
Diluted net income per common share takes into effect the dilutive
effect of potential common shares outstanding.
The Companys only potential common shares outstanding are stock options
and shares of unvested restricted stock. Fair Values
of Financial Instruments Due to the current classification of all
financial instruments of the Company and given the short-term nature of the
related account balances, carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance
sheets approximate fair value. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In June2009, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification ASC
105, Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles ASC 105.ASC 105 establishes the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification Codification as the source of
authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by
nongovernment entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP.Rulesand interpretive releases of the SEC under
authority of federal securities law are also sources of authoritative GAAP for
SEC registrants. References to FASB guidance throughout this document
have been updated for the Codification. The Company adopted an
update to ASC 805 Business Combinations ASC
805on January1, 2009.ASC 805 establishes principles
and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in
its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for
recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and
determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. This update had no material impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company
adopted an update toASC 820 Fair Value Measurement and
DisclosuresASC 820 January1, 2009 for non-financial
assets.ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurement.ASC 820 also emphasizes that fair value is a
market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and sets out a
fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active
markets.Under ASC 820, fair value measurements are disclosed by
level within that hierarchy.The Company adopted ASC 820 for the
fiscal year beginning January1, 2008 for financial assets. The adoption of ASC 820and the update
had no material impact on the Companys financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. The Company
adopted an update to ASC 855 Subsequent Events
ASC 855 on April1, 2009.ASC 855 provides guidance on when
a subsequent event should be recognized in the financial statements. Subsequent
events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the
date of the balance sheet should be recognized at the balance sheet date. Subsequent events that provide evidence about
conditions that arose after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued, or are available to be issued, are not required to be
recognized. The date through which
subsequent events have been evaluated must be disclosed as well as whether it
is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial
statements were available to be issued.
For non-recognized subsequent events which should be disclosed to keep
the financial statements from being misleading, the nature of the event and an
estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot
be made, should be disclosed. The standard is effective for interim or annual
periods ending after June15, 2009.
The adoption of ASC 855 and the update had no material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 37 Table of
Contents Stock
Based Employee Compensation ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC
718, requires recognition of employee services provided in exchange for a
share-based payment based on the grant date fair market value. ASC 718 requires the use of a fair value based measurement method when
granting stock options. The Company selected the Black-Scholes
method to measure the compensation cost for stock options. The Black-Scholes method requires the use of
significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards. The expected term of both the board of
director and key employee options was calculated using the simplified
method. The expected volatility was
calculated primarily with reliance on historical volatility rates. The
Company assumed a dividend yield equivalent to historical dividend rates over
the vesting period. The risk-free rate
utilized in the Black-Scholes calculations was the U.S. Constant Maturity
Treasury Security for the period equivalent to the term of the option. The fair value of
options granted under the 1994 Stock Plan during 2009 and 2008 was estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions and results

3. FAIR VALUE ASC 820 defines
fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to
transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants on the measurement date.
ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs when measuring fair value. 38 Table of
Contents The standard
describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value Level
1 Quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level
2 Observable
inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that
are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level
3 Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company utilizes the
market approach to measure fair value for its financial assets and
liabilities.The market approach uses prices and other relevant
information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable
assets or liabilities. Assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for December31, 2009 and December31,
2008 are summarized below

We have adopted the
provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC
740. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial
statements and also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, ASC 740
provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The adoption of ASC 740 had no effect on the
amounts previously recognized for income taxes. Interest
and penalties associated with uncertain income tax positions are presented in
income tax expense. During the twelve months
ended December31, 2009, we have not recognized expense for interest and
penalties and do not have any amounts accrued at December31, 2009 and December31,
2008 respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties. The Company is subject
to U.S. and Minnesota taxation. The
Companys tax year for 2007 is subject to examination by the tax
authorities. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to US federal, state, local or foreign
examinations by tax authorities for years before 2007. 5. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Stock
Options The Companys 1994
Stock Plan the Plan provides for the granting of awards in the form of
stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and deferred stock
to key employees and non-employees, including directors of and consultants to
the Company and any subsidiary, to purchase up to a maximum of 1,450,000 shares
of common stock. Options that are
granted under the Plan may be either options that qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended Incentive Stock Options, or those that do not qualify as
Incentive Stock Options Non-Qualified Stock Options. The Plan is administered by the Board of
Directors which determines the persons who are to receive awards under the
Plan, the type of award to be granted, the number of shares subject to each
award and, if an option, the exercise price of each option. The Plan also provides for formula grants of
Non-Qualified Stock Options to non-employee directors of the Company. The Plan provides that payment of the exercise price may be made in the
form of unrestricted shares of common stock already owned by the optionee. The Company calculates the fair market value
of unrestricted shares as the average of the high and low sales prices on the
date of exercise. See Note 6 below for
further information regarding options granted under the Plan. 40 Table of
Contents Employee
Stock Purchase Plan On April3,
1995, the Board of Directors adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. The ESPP is open to all employees of the
Company working more than 15 hours per week.
The ESPP consists of one-year phases.
The phases commence on October1 of each year and under the terms
of the plan, employees are allowed to set aside a portion of their payroll
earnings to purchase shares of the Companys common stock. The purchase price is 95% of the fair market
value of the shares on the termination date of the phase. The plan provides for the sale of up to
350,000 shares. The plan issued 3,844
and 5,879 shares in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The ESPP has issued a total of 238,328 shares
since the inception. 401kPlan On June1,
1998 the Company established a defined contribution savings plan for employees
who had completed one year of service, as defined in the Plan document. The defined contribution savings plan allows
for employee compensation deferral contributions under Section401kof
the Internal Revenue Code and discretionary contributions by the Company. Employer contributions charged to operations
in 2009 and 2008 were approximately $28,000 and $275,000, respectively. In January2009, the Company suspended
its employer contributions for fiscal 2009. Employee
Stock Ownership Plan In December2004,
the Companys Board of Directors approved an Employee Stock Ownership Plan the
ESOP effective for calendar years beginning January1, 2004. All eligible employees of the Company
participate in the ESOP after completing one full calendar year of
service. Contributions to the ESOP are
determined by the Board of Directors and can be made in cash or shares of the
Companys common stock. Annual
contributions are allocated to each participant based on compensation and vest
in accordance with a six year graded vesting schedule. Compensation expense for the ESOP is
determined based on the average fair value of shares on the date the Company
commits to the contribution to the ESOP.
For the purposes of earnings per share, ESOP shares are included in
weighted-average common shares outstanding at year-end as the shares are
committed to be contributed on that date.
On February12, 2008, the Company committed to contribute 10,000
shares of the Companys common stock valued at $109,900. The shares were issued in March2008 and
were allocated to the accounts of eligible employees based upon their 2007
compensation during the first quarter of 2008.
On October24, 2008, the Company suspended its ESOP contribution
for fiscal 2008. As of the date of this
filing, the Company had taken no further action regarding possible
re-introduction of the contribution. Stock
Repurchase Plan On January16,
2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the
repurchase of up to an additional 250,000 shares of the Companys common stock
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule12b-18.
During 2008, the Company repurchased 216,543 shares of common stock at
an average price of $871 for an aggregate purchase price of $1,886,034. The Company did not repurchase any shares in
2009. 6. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Plan, an
equity based compensation plan, provides for the granting of awards in the form
of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, and deferred
stock to key employees and non-employees, including directors of and
consultants to the Company and any subsidiary, for up to a maximum of 1,450,000
shares of common stock. 41 Table of

Board
of Director Grants Each non-employee
member of the Board of Directors receives an annual recurring grant of 3,000
non-qualified stock options. On February1,
2009 and February1, 2008, 15,000 options were granted to the five board
members with an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant
of $666 and $1135, respectively. The
stock options vest over a six-month period and expire in ten years. The
compensation cost associated with the Board of Director options of $18,900 and
$29,700 was recognized as expense over the six-month vesting period in 2009 and
2008, respectively. 2006 Employee Stock Option
Grant On February9, 2006, 15,000 employee
stock options were granted. The
compensation cost associated with the employee stock option grant in 2006 is
being recognized ratably over the four-year vesting period. The compensation cost related to these employee option
awards included in salaries and benefits expense for 2009 and 2008 was $5,146
and $11,578, respectively. As of December31 42 Table of
Contents 2009, there was
$386 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to these stock options
which is expected to be recognized in 2010. 2006 Restricted Stock Grant Also on February9,
2006, 41,000 shares of restricted stock were granted to executive
employees. The restricted stock cliff
vests in four years from the date of granting.
There was no activity during 2009.
In 2008, 5,500 shares were forfeited.
On December31, 2009 there are 35,000 shares outstanding with a
weighted average grant date fair value of $1455. Upon granting,
compensation cost associated with the restricted stock grant was calculated as
the market price on the date of grant of $1455 for the 41,000 shares reduced
by estimated forfeitures of $589,275.
In 2008, as forfeited shares had exceeded original estimated
forfeitures, a new forfeiture rate was calculated. As a result of this new calculation, the
total estimated compensation cost for the restricted stock grant is $487,425. In accordance with the modified prospective
method, the compensation cost related to these awards included in salaries and
benefits expense for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 was
$97,290 and $104,263, respectively. As
of December31, 2009, there was $3,510 of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to restricted stock compensation arrangements granted under the
Plan which is expected to be recognized in 2010. 2009
Employee Stock Option Grant In addition, on April23,
2009, 100,000 options were granted to employees with an exercise price equal to
the market price on the date of grant of $600.
The stock options vest over a 42-month period and expire in ten years. The compensation cost associated with this
grant of employee options is $92,555 to be recognized as expense over the
42-month vesting period. The
compensation cost related to these employee option awards included in salaries
and benefits expense for 2009 was $17,630.
As of December31, 2009, there was $74,925 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to these stock options which is expected to be
recognized over 28 years. The total
income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for stock-based
compensation arrangements was $16,000 and $53,000 for 2009 and 2008,
respectively. 7. EARNINGS PER SHARE COMPUTATIONS The following is a

Options to purchase
264,250 shares of common stock at an average of $1186 per share were
outstanding at December31, 2009 but were not included in the computation
of diluted EPS because the options exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares. 43 Table of
Contents Options to purchase 337,500 shares of
common stock at an average of $1329 per share were outstanding at December31,
2008 but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
options exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares. 8. LINES OF CREDIT The Company has a
general credit agreement with Bremer Bank, which provides a revolving credit
line. On September30, 2009, the
Company signed an amendment with Bremer Bank extending the expiration date from
September30, 2009 to June30, 2010 and adjusting the credit line
from $5,000,000 to $3,000,000. The
Company had no borrowings under this credit line during 2009 and 2008. The credit agreement contains certain
covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with these
requirements as of December31, 2009.
The Company plans to renew this credit line before it expires. Management believes that funds available
under this line of credit, along with funds generated from card room and
simulcast operations, will be sufficient to satisfy its liquidity and capital
resource requirements during 2010. 9. OPERATING LEASES AND COMMITMENTS Purchase
Obligations In March2008, the
Company entered into a six-year totalizator service agreement with Scientific
Games Inc. Pursuant to the agreement,
Scientific Games provides totalizator equipment and computer programs which
record and process all wagers and calculate odds and payoffs. In October2008, the Company entered
into a four-year service agreement to outsource its information technology IT
function. Amounts charged to operations
under these agreements for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 were approximately $644,000 and $377,000,
respectively. Operating
Lease Obligations The Company has
entered into operating leases for rental of office equipment, equipment to
print certain publications, and track equipment to maintain the Racetrack. Amounts charged to operations under these
agreements for the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008 were
approximately $142,000 and $85,000, respectively. All such leases expire on or before September30,
2013. Future lease payment obligations
under these leases are provided in the table below. FUTURE

the purchase of the Racetrack Note 1, the Company entered into an Earn Out
Promissory Note dated March29, 1994.
In accordance with the Earn Out Note, if ioff-track betting
becomes legally permissible in the State of Minnesota and iithe Company
begins to conduct off-track betting with respect to or in connection with its
operations, the Company will be required to pay to the IMR Fund, L.P. the
greater of $700,000 per operating year, as defined, or 20% of the net pretax 44 Table of
Contents profit, as defined
for each of five operating years. At
this time, management believes that the likelihood that these two conditions
will be met, and that the Company will be required to pay these amounts is
remote. At the date if any that these
two conditions are met, the five minimum payments will be discounted back to
their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be
capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The purchase
price will be further increased if payments become due under the 20% of Net
Pretax Profit calculation. The first
payment is to be made 90 days after the end of the third operating year in
which off-track betting is conducted by the Company. Remaining payments would be made within 90
days of the end of each of the next four operating years. The Company is
periodically involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the normal
course of business. Management believes
that the resolution of any pending claims and legal actions at December31,
2009 and as of the date of this report will not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements. The Company has
committed to payment of statutory distributions under a $500,000 bond issued to
the Minnesota Racing Commission. 11. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company paid a
total of $50,100 in both 2009 and 2008 to the Chair and Vice Chair of the
Company in consideration for the services they provided pursuant to consulting
agreements. In addition, another
non-employee Board member received $12,000 in both 2009 and 2008 for services
regarding the Companys strategic planning matters. 12. OPERATING SEGMENTS The Company has
three reportable operating segments: horse racing, card room, and concessions. The horse racing segment includes simulcast
and live horse racing operations, the card room segment includes operations of
Canterbury Parks card room, and the concessions segment provides concessions
during simulcast and live racing, in the card room and during special
events. The Companys reportable
operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products
and services. They are managed
separately because the segments differ in the nature of the products and
services provided, as well as processes to produce those products and
services. The horse racing and card room
segments are regulated by the Minnesota Racing Commission. Depreciation,
interest expense and income taxes are allocated to the segments but no
allocation is made to concessions for shared facilities. However, the concessions segment paid
approximately 25% of gross revenues on live racing and special event days to
the horse racing segment for use of the facilities in 2009 and 2008. 45 Table of

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENT In January2010,
and in accordance with the Racing Act, the Company obtained approval from the
MRC to remodel the card room.
Construction and architectural contracts with various firms were signed
shortly thereafter, and the card room was moved to a temporary location on the
mezzanine level on January25, 2010.
The Company anticipates using cash on hand to fund the project and to
avoid drawing on its line of credit. As
part of the remodel, the Company plans to dispose of assets during the first
quarter of 2010 with a net book value between $850,000 and $1,050,000. The remodeling project is expected to be
complete in April2010. This charge
will be taken in the first quarter of 2010 and will adversely affect net
income. 47 Table of
