COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1. Nature of Business and Organizational Structure  Coldwater CreekInc., a Delaware corporation, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, headquartered in Sandpoint, Idaho, is a multi-channel specialty retailer of women
apparel, accessories, jewelry and gift items. We operate in two operating segments: retail and direct. The retail segment consists of our premium retail stores, merchandise clearance outlet stores and
day spas. The direct segment consists of sales generated through our e-commerce web site and from orders taken from customers over the phone and through the mail.  2. Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.  Fiscal Periods  References to a fiscal year refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest
January31st. This reporting schedule is followed by many national retail companies. This floating fiscal year-end typically results in 13-week fiscal quarters and a
52-week fiscal year, but occasionally will contain an additional week resulting in a 14-week fiscal fourth quarter and a 53-week fiscal year. The fiscal years ended
January29, 2011 fiscal 2010, January30, 2010 fiscal 2009 and January31, 2009 fiscal 2008 consisted of 52weeks.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are embodied in our sales returns accrual, stock-based compensation, contingent liabilities, income taxes, impairment
of long-lived assets, and our inventory reserves calculations. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical results as well as management future expectations. Actual results
may vary from these estimates and assumptions.  Revenue Recognition and Sales Return Estimate  We recognize sales, including shipping and handling income and the related cost of those sales at the time of estimated receipt by the
customer for orders placed from a catalog or on our e-commerce web site and at the point of sale for retail store transactions. We exclude the related sales tax from revenue as sales tax
amounts are recorded on a net basis. We maintain a sales return accrual based on historical experience and future expectations.

Provisions
for sales returns included in accrued liabilities were as follows:

Gift certificates and cards.Our policy regarding gift certificates and gift cards is to record revenue as certificates and cards are
redeemed for
merchandise or when the probability of redemption is remote. We also remit gift certificates and gift cards to the appropriate government agency under applicable unclaimed property laws. Prior to
these events, amounts received from the sale of gift certificates and gift cards are recorded as a liability. Income on unredeemed gift cards and gift certificates was $05million 06million, and $04million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 
Co-branded credit card.Under our co-branded customer credit card program, we receive from the issuing bank a
non-refundable up-front marketing fee for each new credit card account that is opened and activated. The initial up-front marketing fee is deferred and recognized
into revenue over the estimated customer relationship period. We are also eligible to receive an annual revenue sharing payment if certain profitability measures of the program are met. The revenue
sharing payment we receive annually, if any, is deferred and recognized into revenue over the remaining expected life of the co-branded credit card program. In addition, we receive an
ongoing sales royalty which is based on a percentage of purchases made by the card holders. Cardholders receive reward coupons from their credit card purchases that can be used to purchase our
merchandise. The sales royalty is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue over the redemption period of the reward coupons, adjusted for that portion of awards that we estimate will not be
redeemed by customers breakage. We recognize the breakage for unredeemed awards in proportion to the actual awards that are redeemed by customers. We determine our breakage rate based upon Company
specific historical redemption patterns. 
Onecreek.Our onecreek customer loyalty program benefits include sneak peeks at upcoming
trends and
new merchandise, onecreek customer service specialists, exclusive onecreek savings and promotions, free
shipping on returns, and a special birthday gift. The promotions and birthday gifts are typically provided, at our discretion, in the form of customer appreciation discount coupons that can be used to
purchase merchandise. We recognize these discount coupons at the time the sale is recognized.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments with an original maturity date of three months or less at the date of
purchase. As of January29, 2011 and January30, 2010, these instruments consisted mainly of direct investments in money market funds that invest entirely in U.S. Treasury Securities. We
maintain a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents with a well-known and

stable
financial institution. However, we have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at this financial institution that are in excess of federally insured limits. Though we have not
experienced any losses on our cash and cash equivalents to date and we do not anticipate incurring any losses, given the current financial environment and the instability of financial institutions, we
cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits.  Fair Value  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are categorized using defined hierarchical levels related to the subjectivity associated with the
inputs to fair value measurements as follows: Level1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
Level2Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or inputs that are
observable;  
Level3Unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists. As
of January29, 2011 and January30, 2010 we held $391million and $811million, respectively, in money market funds that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using level1 inputs. 
During
fiscal 2010, certain long-lived assets with a net carrying amount of $92million were written down to their fair value of $53million, resulting in an
impairment charge of $39million. During fiscal 2009, certain long-lived store assets, primarily leasehold improvements and equipment, with a net carrying amount of
$07million were written down to their fair value of $01million, resulting in a net impairment charge of $06million. These impairment charges were measured at fair value
using Level3 inputs discounted cash flows. 
We
also have financial assets and liabilities, not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which primarily consist of cash, restricted cash, receivables, payables and
financing obligations, the carrying value of which approximate their fair values.  Trade Accounts Receivable  Our trade accounts receivable are associated primarily with credit card sales to individuals and are recorded at the invoiced amount.
These receivables do not bear interest and are generally converted to cash in two to three days.  Inventories  Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale. Inventory in our distribution center and in our premium retail
stores, outlet stores and day spas is stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market.  Advertising Costs  Direct response advertising includes catalogs and national magazine advertisements that contain an identifying code which allows us to
track related sales. All direct costs associated with the development, 
47  Table of Contents COLDWATER CREEKINC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2. Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
production
and circulation of direct response advertisements are accumulated as prepaid marketing costs. Once the related catalog or national magazine advertisement is either mailed or first appears
in print, these costs are reclassified to deferred marketing costs. These costs are then amortized to selling, general and administrative expenses over the expected sales realization cycle, typically
several weeks. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, direct response advertising expense was $477million, $545million and $573million, respectively. 
Advertising
costs other than direct response advertising include store and event promotions, signage expenses and other general customer acquisition activities. These advertising costs
are expensed as incurred or when the particular store promotion begins. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, advertising expenses other than those related to direct response advertising was
$259million, $223million and $229million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment, including any major additions and improvements made to property and equipment, are recorded at cost. Minor
additions and improvements, as well as maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful life of property or equipment, are charged to operations as incurred. The net book value of
property or equipment sold or retired is removed from the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts with any resulting net gain or loss included in results of operations. 
Depreciation
and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives for buildings and land improvements are 15 to 30years.
The estimated useful lives for furniture and fixtures, technology hardware and internal use software and machinery and equipment are three to 12years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the contractual lives of the underlying operating leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, currently three to 20years, whichever is less.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-lived assets are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, we then determine the fair
value of the asset generally by using a discounted cash flow model. A loss is recognized, if any, by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. In
assessing future cash flows, management is required to make assumptions and judgments, including forecasting future sales, margins and operating expenses over the estimated remaining useful life.
These assumptions and judgments can be affected by consumer spending and overall economic conditions on a localized or regional basis, as well as other factors not necessarily within our control.  Internal-Use Software Costs  Costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use are expensed as incurred until the application development stage has
been reached. Once the application development stage has been reached, certain qualifying costs are capitalized until the software is ready for its intended use.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2. Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Restricted Cash  In connection with the lease of our distribution center we entered into a $40million standby letter of credit during fiscal
2005, which required $44million in cash collateral. This restricted cash was initially recorded as a non-current asset in our consolidated balance sheet. The principal amount of
the letter of credit and the related restricted cash amount reduce at a rate of 20percent per year over five years commencing January1, 2008. As of January29, 2011 we had
$09million in restricted cash recorded in current assets related to the $08million remaining letter of credit.  Accounting for Leases  We lease our distribution center, customer contact centers, and all of our premium retail, outlet and day spa space, as well as certain
other property and equipment. Nearly all of our leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our fixed, non-cancelable terms of our premium retail, outlet and day spa leases are generally
five to 10years. Most of our leases include renewal options that allow us to extend the term beyond the initial non-cancelable term. Several of our leases require additional rent
based on sales, which is recorded as rent expense when the additional rent payments become probable. Also, most of the leases require payment of real estate taxes, insurance and certain common area
maintenance costs in addition to future minimum lease payments. We have four capital leases with terms ranging from approximately four to 30years. 
Certain
of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rental payments over the lease. For these leases, we recognize the related rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which commences for accounting purposes on the date we have access and control over the leased store possession. Possession occurs prior
to the making of any lease payments and approximately 60 to 90days prior to the opening of a store. In the early years of a lease with rent escalations, the recorded rent expense will exceed
the actual cash payments. The amount of rent expense that exceeds the cash payments is recorded as deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheet. In the later years of a lease with rent escalations,
the recorded rent expense will be less than the actual cash payments. The amount of cash payments that exceed the rent expense is then recorded as a reduction to deferred rent. Deferred rent related
to lease agreements
with escalating rent payments was $361 and $340million at January29, 2011 and January30, 2010, respectively. Additionally,
certain operating leases contain terms which obligate the landlord to remit cash to us as an incentive to enter into the lease agreement. These lease incentives are
commonly referred to as tenant allowances. We record the amount to be remitted by the landlord as a tenant allowance receivable as we earn it under the terms of the contract. At the same time, we
record deferred rent in an equal amount in the consolidated balance sheet. The tenant allowance receivable is reduced as cash is received from the landlord, while the deferred rent is amortized as a
reduction to rent expense over the lease term. Deferred rent related to tenant allowances, including both the current and long-term portions, was $1016million and
$1109million at January29, 2011 and January30, 2010, respectively.

2. Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. On
a quarterly basis, we review and update our tax positions as necessary to add any new uncertain tax positions taken, or to remove previously identified uncertain positions that have
been adequately resolved. Additionally, uncertain positions may be remeasured as warranted by changes in facts or law. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments, including
estimating the amount, timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.  Contingent Liabilities  We record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been
incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the
contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized. Legal costs related to the loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.

Cost of Sales 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Design costs;  Buying costs incurred to acquire inventory;  Duty, commission and other fees related to goods;  Freight costs associated with moving merchandise from suppliers to the Company distribution center
and from the distribution center to stores;
Costs associated with receiving and warehousing;  Costs associated with shipping and handling;  Payroll, bonus and benefit costs related to employees involved in design, buying, receiving

Advertising and marketing costs; and  Legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead costs. 
Stock-Based Compensation  We provide equity awards to employees in the form of stock options and restricted stock units RSUs. We expense the estimated fair
value of these awards over the requisite
employee service period, which is generally the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan  We provide a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan SERP to certain of our executive officers. The SERP is an unfunded,
non-qualified benefit plan that provides eligible participants with monthly benefits upon retirement, termination of employment, death or disability, subject to certain conditions. We
fully recognize a liability for the underfunded projected benefit obligation of the SERP in our financial statements. Actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs, and any
remaining transition obligations are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, net of tax, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. Any

Store Pre-Opening Costs  We incur rent, preparation and training costs prior to the opening of a retail store or day spa. These pre-opening costs
are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Pre-opening costs were $10million, $06million and $26million during
fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009, and fiscal 2008, respectively.  List rental income  Net customer list rental income is recorded as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. We recognize rental income

The amounts of capitalized interest were not material for all periods presented.  Vendor Allowances  We account for allowances received from merchandise vendors as an adjustment to the prices of the vendor products. This adjustment is
recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of inventory and, when sold, as a reduction to cost of sales. The terms of the vendor allowance arrangements are

one year in length and settle semi-annually. We earned allowances from merchandise vendors of $59million, $60million, and $65million in fiscal 2010,
fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively.  Self-Insurance  We have a self-insurance plan for health and welfare benefits and provide an accrual to cover our obligation. The accrual
for our self-insurance liability is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, and is not discounted. Management considers a number of factors,
including historical claims information, when determining the amount of the accrual. We maintain third-party stop-loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of
predetermined retained amounts. Costs related to the administration of the plan and related claims are expensed as incurred.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU
No2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangementsa consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. This ASU
provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements. The amendments in this ASU replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with
selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity-specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant. The amendments in this ASU also establish a
selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The amendments in this ASU eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be
allocated at the inception
of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2010. The initial adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our revenue recognition policies, particularly our co-branded credit
card program.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
6. Credit Facility Continued subfacilities
for the issuance of up to $700million in letters of credit and swingline advances of up to $100million. The credit facility has a maturity date of February13,
2013. The actual amount of credit that is available from time to time under the credit facility is limited to a borrowing base amount that is determined according to, among other things, a percentage
of the value of eligible inventory plus a percentage of the value of eligible credit card receivables, as reduced by certain reserve amounts that may be required by the lender. The proceeds of any
borrowings under the credit facility are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As of January29, 2011 and January30, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding
under the credit facility. As of January29, 2011 and January30, 2010, we had $272million and $195million in letters of credit issued, respectively, resulting in
$428million and $505million, respectively, available for borrowing under our credit facility. Borrowings
under the credit facility will generally accrue interest at a margin ranging from 225% to 275% determined according to the average unused availability under the credit
facility over a reference rate of, at our election, either LIBOR or a base rate, as defined in the agreement. Letters of credit under the credit facility accrue fees at a rate equal to the interest
margin that is in effect from time to time. Commitment fees accrue at a rate of 050%, which is assessed on the average unused portion of the credit facility maximum amount. 
The
credit facility has financial covenants that are limited to capital expenditures, minimum inventory book value and maximum facility usage as a percentage of the borrowing base value.
The credit facility also contains various restrictive covenants relating to customary matters, such as indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, mergers, dispositions and dividends. We were in
compliance with all covenants for all periods presented. 
The
credit facility generally contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure
periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lender, the obligations under the credit facility may be accelerated, outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash
collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral.

7. Income Taxes Continued  Income tax expense benefit attributable to income before provision for income taxes differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before
provision for income taxes as a result of the following: 
Fiscal Year Ended January29,

Our income tax expense from fiscal year 2009 includes the recording of a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax
assets with corresponding charges of $244million to tax expense and $01million to other comprehensive loss during fiscal 2009. 
Our
income tax benefit for fiscal year 2008 includes an out-of-period adjustment related to the correction of errors in the calculation of previous year income
taxes. This adjustment increased our tax benefit by $25million in fiscal year 2008. This adjustment was primarily related to stock options in addition to fixed asset basis differences that
accumulated over several previous years. Management has determined the resulting correction was not material to fiscal year 2008. 
U.S.
federal income taxes have not been provided on unremitted foreign earnings as those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. However, if these earnings were not
considered permanently reinvested, under current law, the incremental tax on such undistributed earnings would not be material. 
We
received tax credits from the States of West Virginia and Idaho, which are reflected as state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The West Virginia tax credits, which are available
through 2012, and the Idaho tax credits, which are available through 2019, are subject to annual limitations and are recognized in the year in which they are available to reduce taxable income. We
have accumulated $03million and $05million of West Virginia and Idaho tax credits, respectively, as of January29, 2011 that are carried over to utilize in subsequent years. 
As
of January29, 2011, we had approximately $353million and $49million of federal and state net operating losses. We generated approximately
$353million federal and $17million state net operating losses during fiscal 2010. The federal net operating losses are carried forward and available to reduce taxable income through
fiscal 2030. The state net operating losses are carried forward and available to reduce taxable income in the various states through fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2030, depending upon the state.

Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the
existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulated loss incurred over the three-year period ended January29, 2011. Such
objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence. We have a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The
amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be
given to subjective evidence.

The unrecognized tax benefits represent items in which we may not prevail with certain taxing authorities, based upon varying interpretations of
the applicable law. We expect to resolve $24million in unrecognized tax benefits within fiscal year 2011 due to the anticipated completion of our current Internal Revenue Service examination
with no impact to our effective rate in future periods. 
We
recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. An immaterial amount of interest and penalties were recognized during fiscal 2010,
2009 and 2008. 
We
file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and local and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to Internal Revenue Service examinations
for fiscal years prior
to fiscal 2006. The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an examination of our federal income tax returns for fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2009. With limited exceptions, we are no longer
subject to state or local examinations for our fiscal years prior to fiscal 2003. Currently several state examinations are in progress. Income tax returns filed in foreign jurisdictions are immaterial
to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
8. Net Earnings Loss Per Common Share  Basic net earnings loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings
loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the combination of other potentially dilutive weighted average common shares and the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive weighted average common shares include the dilutive effect of stock options, RSUs and shares to be purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase
Plan ESPP for each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the

paid-in-capital, if any, when the share is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period. 
The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per common share:

The computation of the dilutive effect of other potential common shares excluded options, RSUs and shares to be purchased under our ESPP
representing 27million, 33million and 31million shares of
common stock in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Under the treasury stock method, the inclusion of these stock awards would have resulted in lower loss per share, causing their effect to be
antidilutive.  9. Stock-Based Compensation  Our Amended and Restated Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in March 2005 and approved by shareholders in June 2005. The Plan provides for
share-based compensation for officers and key employees, directors and consultants, and other independent advisors. The Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1996 Plan, but did
not affect awards granted under that plan, some of which remain outstanding. 
Eligible
individuals may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, be granted stock options, shares of restricted or unrestricted stock, RSUs and stock
appreciation rights. The maximum number of shares of common stock underlying awards which may be issued over the term of the Plan cannot exceed 16,838,402 shares, subject to adjustment for stock
splits and similar capitalization changes. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs. As of January29, 2011, 10million shares of common
stock remain available for future grants under the Plan. The Plan will terminate on March25, 2015, subject to earlier termination by the Board of Directors.

There was no related tax benefit for fiscal 2010, compared with a tax benefit of $20million and $14million for fiscal 2009 and
2008, respectively. During fiscal 2009, a valuation allowance was recorded against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets, including those generated by the stock-based compensation expense
related tax benefits. Stock-based compensation capitalized into inventory and fixed assets for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not material. As
of January29, 2011, total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements was $45million. This expense is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 25years. 
On
September12, 2009, our former director, President and Chief Executive Officer CEO resigned. As a result, we recorded stock-based compensation of $21million during
fiscal 2009, related to the acceleration of all our former CEO unvested equity awards, per the original terms of his employment agreement.  Stock Options  Options are granted with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Options
generally vest and become exercisable on a pro rata basis over a three-, four- or five-year period from the date of grant. The maximum term of each grant may not exceed ten
years, subject to earlier expiration for vested options not exercised following termination of employment. The
fair value for stock option awards was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008:

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates in effect at the time of the grant with an equivalent remaining
term. The expected volatility of our stock price is based on a combination of historical volatility and the implied volatility of our exchange traded options. Expected life is derived from historical
experience, taking into consideration expected future employee behavior. Stock-based
compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and
future expectations. The forfeiture rate will be revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the amount estimated. The

During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $02million, $25million and
$06million, respectively.  RSU Awards  During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we granted 261,887 and 79,659 RSUs, respectively, with only service conditions at a weighted average grant
date fair market value of $408 and $702, respectively. During fiscal 2010, we also granted 273,000 RSUs that, in addition to service conditions also contained performance conditions, at a weighted
average grant date fair value of $390, of which 257,750 remained outstanding as of January29, 2011. The awards with the additional performance conditions are subject to the achievement of
combined earnings before interest expense and taxes EBIT target for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, as well as continued employment with the Company and the receipt of

satisfactory
performance reviews. The number of shares actually awarded will range from 0 to 200percent of the base award amount, depending on our EBIT during the performance period. During
fiscal 2009, we granted 156,000 RSUs that, in addition to service conditions, contained performance and market conditions, at a weighted average grant date fair value of $523, of
which 30,000 remained outstanding at January29, 2011. The awards with the additional performance and
market conditions are independent of each other and equally weighted, and are based on three metrics: operating income, comparable store growth CSG relative to a peer group, and total shareholder
return TSR relative to a peer group. The fair value of the RSUs with operating income and CSG goals are based on the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of the RSUs containing the
TSR condition was determined using a statistical model that incorporates the probability of meeting performance targets based on historical returns relative to a peer group. All awards with
performance and market conditions are measured over the vesting period and are charged to compensation expense over the requisite service period based on the number of shares expected to vest. RSUs
generally vest over a one- or three-year period from date of grant.

During the fiscal years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, the total fair market value of RSUs vested was $04million, $23million and
$05million, respectively. 
10. Employee Stock Purchase Plan  Our 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP was adopted by the Board or Directors in March 2006 and approved by our shareholders in June 2006. Through participation in the ESPP
employees can purchase Coldwater Creek common stock at a five percent discount to the closing market price on the last trading day of each calendar quarter. Employees may not purchase more than 1,000
shares of common stock during any purchase period and may at no point in any calendar year purchase shares of common stock having an aggregate fair market value in excess of $25,000. Additionally, an
employee who owns, or would own as a result of ESPP participation, five percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock is not eligible for participation in the ESPP.
The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be made available for purchase under the ESPP is 18million. As of January29, 2011, approximately 12million shares of
common stock remain available for purchase under the ESPP. The shares that are available for purchase may be unissued authorized shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased on the open market. We
have determined that the ESPP is a non-compensatory plan; therefore no compensation expense related to the ESPP has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Our employees
purchased approximately 141,000, 162,000 and 215,000 shares during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 at an average share price of $399, $420 and $421, respectively.

11. Defined Contribution Plan  We provide a tax-qualified employee savings, retirement and profit sharing plan qualified under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code the 401k Plan. Under
the 401k Plan eligible employees may elect to defer a portion of their current compensation, up to certain statutorily prescribed annual limits, and make corresponding periodic contributions into
the 401k Plan. We match a certain percentage of the employee overall contribution, which we discontinued from February1, 2009 to May8, 2010. In addition, we may make a
discretionary profit sharing contribution
based on our overall profitability. We recognized contribution expense of $12million, $01million and $42million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  12. Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan  The funded status of the SERP as of January29, 2011 and January30, 2010 was as follows:

The assumed discount rate is based, in part, upon a modeling process that considers both high quality long term indices and the duration of the
SERP relative to the durations implicit in the broader indices. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the obligation and periodic expense pursuant to
the SERP. To the extent the discount rate increases or decreases, the SERP obligation is decreased or increased, accordingly. When calculating the projected benefit obligation at January29,
2011, the rate of compensation increase is not applicable as there are no employees currently accruing benefits. 
As
the SERP is an unfunded plan, we were not required to make any contributions during fiscal 2010 and 2009. The following table summarizes the expected future benefit payments:

Leases 
During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred aggregate rent expense under operating leases of $791million 785million and $739million, respectively, including $157million, $152million and $141million, respectively, of common area maintenance costs CAM 03million, $06million and $11million, respectively, of rent expense classified as store pre-opening costs and an immaterial amount of contingent rent expense
for each period. Aggregate rent expense under operating leases does not include related real estate taxes of $112million, $106million and $95million for fiscal years 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

13. Commitments Continued 
As
of January29, 2011 our minimum lease payment requirements, which include the predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals and exclude contingent rental payments,
CAM, real estate taxes and the amortization of lease incentives for our operating leases, are as follows: 
Operating Leases

The primary capital lease is for our 69,000 square foot facility located in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, which functions as a customer contact center, IT
data center and office space. This lease was amended on April22, 2009 resulting in the lease classified as a capital lease through fiscal 2028, with a remaining lease commitment as of
January29, 2011 of $198million, and as an operating lease from fiscal 2029 through fiscal 2038, with a remaining lease commitment as of January29, 2011 of
$163million. All other capital leases pertain to various technology equipment and other real estate. 
Other 
We had future non-cancelable commitments to purchase inventory of $1622million and capital expenditures of
$13million at January29, 2011. As of January29, 2011 we had $08million committed under our standby letter of credit related to the lease of our distribution center. 
14. Contingencies 
Legal Proceedings 
We are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of business. Actions filed against us from
time to time include commercial, intellectual property infringement, customer and employment claims, including class action lawsuits alleging that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other
laws. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to all lawsuits and legal proceedings currently pending against us. Though we will continue to vigorously defend such lawsuits and legal proceedings,
we are unable to predict with certainty whether or not we will ultimately be successful. However, based on management evaluation, we believe that the resolution of these matters, taking into account
existing contingency accruals and the availability of insurance and other indemnifications, will not materially impact our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On
September12, 2006, as amended on April25, 2007, Brighton Collectibles,Inc. Brighton filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California. The complaint alleged, among other things, that we violated trade dress and copyright laws. On November21, 2008, a jury found us liable to Brighton for
copyright and trade dress infringement. In January 2009, the court entered a judgment in the total amount of $80million, which includes damages of $27million on the trade dress
claim, $41million in damages and profits on the copyright claim and $12million in attorneys' fees. We have appealed the judgment as we believe there are legitimate grounds to
overturn the judgment. Pending the appeal, the court entered a temporary stay of execution conditioned on us posting an $80million bond, which has been posted. On December12, 2008, as
amended on September17, 2009, Brighton filed another complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. This additional complaint alleges
copyright infringement of three different Brighton designs and seeks to recover damages of approximately $07million, plus attorneys' fees and costs. We are vigorously defending this matter.
We believe it is without merit and are asserting various defenses to the action. We believe that the amount of loss, if any, related to these legal proceedings is adequately reserved for or covered by
insurance. 
Other 
Our multi-channel business model subjects us to state and local taxes in numerous jurisdictions, including state income, franchise, and
sales and use tax. We collect these taxes in jurisdictions in which we have a physical presence. While we believe we have paid or accrued for all taxes based on our interpretation of applicable law,
tax laws are complex and interpretations differ
from state to state. In the past, some taxing jurisdictions have assessed additional taxes and penalties on us, asserting either an error in our calculation or an interpretation of the law that
differed from our own. It is possible that taxing authorities may make additional assessments in the future. In addition to taxes, penalties and interest, these assessments could cause us to incur
legal fees associated with resolving disputes with taxing authorities. 
Additionally,
changes in state and local tax laws, such as temporary changes associated with tax holidays and other programs, require us to make continual changes to our collection and
reporting systems that may relate to only one taxing jurisdiction. If we fail to update our collection and reporting systems in response to these changes, any over collection or under collection of
sales taxes could subject us to interest and penalties, as well as private lawsuits and damage to our reputation.

January30, 2010, respectively.  16. Segment Reporting  Our merchandise is sold through two operating segments, retail and direct. The performance of each operating segment is based on segment operating income, which is defined as net sales
less the cost of merchandise and related acquisition costs and certain directly identifiable and allocable operating costs. For the direct segment, these operating costs primarily consist of catalog
development, production, and circulation costs, e-commerce advertising costs and order processing costs. For the retail segment, these operating costs primarily consist of store selling
and occupancy costs. Corporate and other expenses consist of unallocated shared-service costs and general and administrative expenses.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  16. Segment Reporting Continued Unallocated
shared-service costs include merchandising, distribution, inventory planning and quality assurance costs, as well as corporate occupancy costs. General and administrative expenses include
costs associated with general corporate management and shared departmental services i.e.,finance,
accounting, information technology and human resources. Operating segment depreciation and amortization is allocated to each operating segment. Corporate and other depreciation and amortization and
capital expenditures are related to corporate headquarters, merchandise distribution, and technology infrastructure. We do not review total assets by segment. We have determined that the Chief
Operating Decision Maker is our Chief Executive Officer.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we recorded a $263million non-cash income tax charge in continuing operations, or
$029 per share, related to a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. U.S.GAAP requires that we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax
assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that
can be objectively verified. A company current or previous losses are given more weight than its projected future performance. Consequently, based on available evidence, in particular our
three-year historical cumulative losses, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset. The recording of a valuation allowance has no impact on cash and does not
preclude the company from utilizing the full amount of the deferred tax asset in future profitable periods.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
Company reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. 
Our
management, with the participation of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15e of the Exchange Act, as of January29, 2011. Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January29, 2011. 
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rule13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of January29, 2011. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework. Our management concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of January29, 2011. The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January29, 2011 has been audited by Deloitte ToucheLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which appears below. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Coldwater CreekInc.
Sandpoint, Idaho 
We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Coldwater CreekInc. and subsidiaries the Company as of January29, 2011, based on criteria established
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January29, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended January29, 2011 of the Company and our report dated March25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. s/
