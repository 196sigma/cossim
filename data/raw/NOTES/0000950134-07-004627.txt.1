Item8. These instruments are subject to interest rate risk.   We had no outstanding variable rate debt as of December31,
2006. As of December31, 2005 we had approximately
$341million outstanding variable rate debt. As of
December31, 2005, the carrying value of our long-term
variable rate debt, including accrued interest, was
approximately $342million. The fair value of this debt
approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are
based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates.
A hypothetical 1% increase in the applicable interest rates as
of December31, 2005 would increase annual interest expense
by approximately $03million.   As of December31, 2006, the carrying value of our
long-term fixed rate debt, including accrued interest, was
$98million, 611% MARAD bonds $94million and a
fresh-start premium of $04million. As of
December31, 2005, the carrying value of our long-term
fixed rate debt, including accrued interest, was
$122million. The fair value of our long-term fixed rate
debt as of December31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately
$95million and $122million, respectively. Fair
value was determined using discounted future cash flows based on
quoted market prices, where available, on our current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements as of the balance sheet dates. A hypothetical 1%
increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease the
fair value of our long-term fixed rate debt as of
December31, 2006 and 2005 by approximately
$03million and $04million, respectively. The
hypothetical fair values are based on the same assumptions
utilized in computing fair values.   On February7, 2007, we issued $1250million of
3%senior convertible debentures due in 2027. On
February12, 2007, the initial purchasers of the debentures
exercised their $250million purchase option. The net
proceeds received from the sales of the debentures was
approximately $1455million. We intend to use the net
proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes, which
may include pursuing opportunities in emerging markets, further
augmenting our fleet renewal program and pursuing strategic
acquisition opportunities that may arise.   Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Sensitivity   Our consolidated reporting currency is the U.S.Dollar
although we have substantial operations located outside the
United States. We are primarily exposed to fluctuations in the
foreign currency exchange rates of the Norwegian Kroner, the
British Pound, the Brazilian Real and the Nigerian Naira. A
number of our subsidiaries use a different functional currency
than the U.S. Dollar. The functional currencies of these
subsidiaries include the Norwegian Kroner, the Brazilian Real,
and the Nigerian Naira. As a result, the reported amount of our
assets and liabilities related to our
non-U.S.operations
and, therefore, our consolidated financial statements will
fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates.   We manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as
much foreign revenue as possible in U.S.Dollars. To the
extent that our foreign subsidiaries revenues are denominated in
U.S.Dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates
impact our earnings. This is somewhat mitigated by the amount of
foreign subsidiary expenses that are also denominated in
U.S.Dollars. In order to further mitigate this risk, we
may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match
the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use
foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative
purposes. The counterparties to these contracts would be limited
to major financial institutions, which would minimize
counterparty credit risk.   There were no foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding
during 2006 or 2005.   In accordance with SFASNo52, Foreign Currency
Translation, all assets and liabilities of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S.Dollars at the
exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenues
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
reflected in a separate component of stockholders equity.
We recorded other comprehensive losses of $95million as
of December31, 2005 and other comprehensive gains of
$88million and $177million for the years ended
December31, 2006 and 2004, respectively, as a result of
the net increase or decrease in the value of   
41 Table of Contents   the NOK and other currencies against the U.S.Dollar. As a
result of fresh-start accounting, we effectively recognized
$351million in currency translation adjustments during
our reorganization as a fresh-start adjustment, which were
previously a component of other comprehensive income.   As of December31, 2006, we had repaid all previous draws
on our NOK Revolver, and retired our NOK Term Loan. At
December31, 2005 and 2004, we had the equivalent of
$342million and $785million, respectively, of
outstanding NOK-denominated indebtedness, including accrued
interest. The potential increase in the U.S.Dollar
equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a
hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates at such date
would be approximately zero, $38million and
$87million at December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

43 Table of Contents   REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and   Stockholders of Trico Marine Services, Inc.   We have completed integrated audits of Trico Marine Services,
Inc.s Successor Company 2006 and 2005 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006 in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement
schedule   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Trico Marine Services, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for year ended
December31, 2006 and the period from March15, 2005
to December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under a2
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Notes1, 2 and 3 to the consolidated
financial statements, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of New York confirmed the Companys
reorganization plan the plan on March15,
2005. Confirmation of the plan resulted in the discharge of all
claims against the Company that arose before March15, 2005
and substantially alters rights and interests of equity security
holders as provided for in the plan. The plan was substantially
consummated on March15, 2005 and the Company emerged from
bankruptcy. In connection with its emergence from bankruptcy,
the Company adopted fresh start accounting as of March15,
2005.   As discussed in Notes2 and 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, in connection with the emergence from bankruptcy,
the Company changed its method of accounting for marine
inspection costs from the defer and amortize method
to the expense as incurred method and adopted the
revised version of SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation entitled Share-Based
Payment SFASNo123R as of
March15, 2005.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable   
44 Table of Contents   assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

45 Table of Contents   REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and   Stockholders of Trico Marine Services, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated statements listed in the
accompany index present fairly, in all material respects, the
results of Trico Marine Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries
Predecessor Company operations and their cash flows for the
period from January1, 2005 to March14, 2005 and the
year ended December31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the index appearing under a2 presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the

free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Notes1, 2 and 3 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company filed a petition on
December21, 2004 with the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Southern District of New York for reorganization under
the provisions of Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Companys reorganization plan was substantially consummated
on March15, 2005 and the Company emerged from bankruptcy.
In connection with its emergence from bankruptcy, the Company
adopted fresh start accounting.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

The
Company   Trico Marine Services, Inc. the Company is a
leading provider of marine support vessels to the offshore oil
and gas industry, primarily in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico
the Gulf, West Africa, Mexico, Southeast Asia
through our partnership and to a lesser extent Brazil. As of
December31, 2006, our fleet consisted of 68vessels,
including ten large capacity platform supply vessels
PSVs, six large anchor handling towing and supply
vessels AHTSs, 44 supply vessels, seven crew
boats, and one line handling utility vessel. Our diversified
fleet of vessels provides a broad range of services to offshore
oil and gas operators, including the transportation of drilling
materials, supplies and crews to drilling rigs and other
offshore facilities; towing drilling rigs and equipment from one
location to another; and support for the construction,
installation, repair and maintenance of offshore facilities.
Using our larger and more sophisticated vessels, we also provide
support for deepwater ROVs remotely operated vehicles, well
stimulation, sea floor cable laying and trenching services.   On December21, 2004, Trico Marine Services, Inc. and two
of its U.S.subsidiaries, Trico Marine Assets, Inc. and
Trico Marine Operators, Inc., collectively, the
Debtors filed prepackaged voluntary
petitions for reorganization under chapter11
Chapter11 of title11 of the United
States Code the Bankruptcy Code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
the Bankruptcy Court under case numbers
04-17985
through
04-17987.
The reorganization was jointly administered under the caption
In re Trico Marine Services, Inc., etal., Case
No04-17985.
The Debtors operated as
debtors-in-possession
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code during the period from
December21, 2004 through March14, 2005. On
March15, 2005, the Exit Date, the Debtors emerged from
Chapter11 protection. See Note3.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of Presentation.The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.   The financial statements for the period in which the Company was
in bankruptcy were prepared in accordance with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position
90-7,
Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
the Bankruptcy Code
SOP90-7.
SOP90-7
required the Company to, among other things, 1identify
transactions that are directly associated with the bankruptcy
proceedings from those events that occur during the normal
course of business, 2identify pre-petition liabilities
subject to compromise from those that are not subject to
compromise or are post-petition liabilities and 3apply
fresh-start accounting rules upon emergence from
bankruptcy see Note3. During the reorganization, the
Companys only liabilities subject to compromise were its
$250million
87/8%senior
notes due 2012 the Senior Notes and the related
accrued interest. In addition, the Company discontinued accruing
interest on the Senior Notes as of December21, 2004 the
Commencement Date, which interest would have
totaled approximately $51million during the period from
the Commencement Date to the Exit Date.   In accordance with
SOP90-7,
the Company adopted fresh-start accounting as of the
Exit Date. Fresh-start accounting is required upon a substantive
change in control and requires that the reporting entity
allocate the reorganization value of the Company to its assets
and liabilities in a manner similar to that which is required
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No141, Business
Combinations. Under the provisions of fresh-start
accounting, a new entity has been deemed created for financial
reporting purposes. References to the Successor
Company in the consolidated financial statements and the
notes thereto refer to the Company on and after March15,
2005, after giving effect to the provisions of the plan of
reorganization the Plan and the application of
fresh-start accounting. References to the Predecessor
Company herein and therein refer to the Company prior to
March15, 2005. The financial statements for the period
ended December31, 2004 do not reflect the effect of any
changes in the Companys capital structure or changes in
fair values of assets and liabilities as a result of fresh-start
accounting. For further information on fresh-start accounting,
see Note3.   Consolidation Policy.The consolidated
financial statements include the Companys majority owned
subsidiaries, and its minority owned variable interest
subsidiaries for which the Company has been determined   
51 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   Cash and Cash Equivalents.All
investments with original maturity dates of three months or less
are considered to be cash equivalents.   Restricted Cash.The Company segregates
restricted cash due to legal or other restrictions regarding its
use. At December31, 2006, the total restricted cash
balance of $126million is primarily related to the
following   
Cash held in escrow for outstanding letters of credit, as
prescribed following the Companys retirement of the
$50million secured revolving credit facility in 2004.
Since the cash held in escrow for outstanding letters of credit
will not be used to offset currently maturing liabilities, the
balance of $75million has been classified as
Restricted cash noncurrent in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements   
$35million held in escrow until the second closing of
EMSL scheduled to occur at January1, 2008 at which time
the Company will transfer the remaining four vessels to EMSL
see Note17. Since the cash held in escrow will not be
used to offset currently maturing liabilities, it has been
classified as Restricted cash noncurrent
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements;and   
Statutory requirements in Norway which require a subsidiary to
segregate cash that will be used to pay tax withholdings in
following periods, and other cash amounts held in escrow for
specific purposes aggregating $07million at
December31, 2006, which are classified as current assets.   Accounts Receivable.In the normal
course of business, the Company extends credit to its customers
on a short-term basis, generally 90days or less. The
Companys principal customers are major integrated oil
companies and large independent oil and gas companies as well as
foreign government-owned or controlled companies that provide
logistics, construction and other services to such oil companies
and foreign government organizations. Although credit risks
associated with our customers are considered minimal, the
Company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and
makes provisions for doubtful accounts as necessary.   The Company is exposed to insurance risks related to the
Companys insurance and reinsurance contracts with various
insurance entities. The reinsurance recoverable amount can vary
depending on the size of a loss. The exact amount of the
reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are
settled. The Company records the reinsurance recoverable amount
when the claim has been communicated and accepted by the carrier
and the Company expects to receive amounts owed. The Company
monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for
possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for
doubtful reinsurance receivables.   Accounting for long-lived
assets.Long-lived assets are recorded at the
original cost and reduced by the amount of impairments, if any.
In addition to the original cost of the asset, the recorded
value is impacted by a number of policy elections, including the
estimation of useful lives, residual values and when necessary,
impairment charges and the application of fresh-start
accounting. See Note3 for a discussion of fresh-start
accounting.   On March15, 2005, the Company recorded its vessels at
their estimated fair values, reduced by the pro-rata application
of negative goodwill discussed in Note3. Prior to
March15, 2005, the Company recorded vessels at acquisition
cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis,
reviewing existing fleet plans, and comparing estimated lives to
competitors that operate similar fleets. Depreciation for
financial statement purposes is provided on the straight-line
method, assuming a salvage value of between zero and 10% for
marine vessels. Residual values are estimated based on our
historical experience with regards to the sale of both vessels
and spare parts, and are established in conjunction with the
estimated useful lives of the vessel. Marine vessels are
depreciated over useful lives ranging from 15 to 35years
from the date of original acquisition, estimated based on
historical experience for the particular vessel type. Major
modifications, which extend the useful life of marine vessels,
are capitalized and amortized over the adjusted remaining useful
life of the vessel. Buildings and improvements are depreciated
over a useful life of 15 to 40years. Transportation and
other equipment are depreciated over a useful life of five to
ten years. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company reset the
remaining lives of our long-lived   
52 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   assets and began to depreciate the new book values over those
remaining useful live; buildings and improvements, seven to
thirty-three years, marine vessels three to twenty-seven years
and transportation one to nine years. When assets are retired or
disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation thereon are
removed, and any resultant gains or losses are recognized in
current operations. The Company utilizes judgment in
idetermining whether an expenditure is a maintenance
expense or a capital asset; iidetermining the estimated
useful lives of assets; iiidetermining the salvage
values to be assigned to assets; and ivdetermining if or
when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates
affects how much depreciation expense the Company recognizes
their income statement, whether the Company has a gain or loss
on the disposal of an asset, and whether or not the Company
records an impairment loss related to an asset.   Depreciation expense amounted to approximately
$250million, $204million, $67million and
$329million for year ended December31, 2006, the
period from March15, 2005 through December31, 2005,
the period from January1, 2005 though March14, 2005
and the year ended December31, 2004, respectively.   Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of
vessels. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the
asset to which it relates and is amortized over the assets
estimated useful life. During 2006, the Company capitalized
$03million in interest for the construction of two GPA
640 design 210-foot diesel electric powered platform supply
vessels, the Marin Teknikk Design MT6009 MKII platform supply
vessel and to upgrade our information systems. No interest was
capitalized in 2004 or 2005.   Impairment of long-lived assets.In
accordance with the provisions of SFASNo144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, we review long-lived assets for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of any such asset or asset group may not be recoverable.
We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in
operations when the net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets or asset groups are less than the
carrying amount of those items. For assets held for sale,
impairment losses are recorded when the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds the estimated selling price of the asset less
transaction costs. We have grouped assets together for
impairment testing purposes if they are determined to be
interchangeable within their asset class. Cold-stacked vessels
are grouped with other like active vessels for impairment review
if the cold-stacked vessel is determined to be capable of
returning to service without an economic burden to the Company,
and is expected to be marketable once it returns. For grouped
classes, we have not considered individual assets on a
stand-alone basis for review, unless that vessel is considered
withdrawn from service. As of December31, 2006, the
Company had one remaining cold-stacked supply vessel, which was
moved to assets held for sale in the first quarter of 2007.
During 2006, we activated five cold-stacked supply vessels, sold
one cold-stacked supply vessel, and contributed five
cold-stacked supply vessels to the EMSL partnership. The vessels
contributed to EMSL are in the process of undergoing maintenance
and classification work and are scheduled to be reactivated in
early 2007. Our cash flow estimates are based upon historical
results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market
rates, utilization, operating performance and other factors. Our
estimates of cash flows may differ materially from actual cash
flows due to changes in economic conditions or changes in an
assets operating performance, among other things. If the
undiscounted value of the cash flows is less than the carrying
value, we recognize an impairment loss, measured as the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the net discounted cash
flows. While we believe that our estimates of future cash flows
are reasonable, different assumptions regarding future market
rates, utilization and operating performance could materially
affect our evaluations.   Marine vessel spare parts.Marine
vessel spare parts are stated at the lower of average cost or
market and are included in other long-term assets in the
consolidated balance sheet.   Deferred marine inspection
costs.Beginning on the Exit Date, marine
inspection costs are expensed in the period incurred rather than
deferring and amortizing the costs over the period between
marine inspections. Prior to fresh-start, dry-docking
expenditures incurred in connection with regulatory marine
inspections were capitalized and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period to be benefited generally 24 to
60months. These marine inspection costs were included in
other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Non-regulatory
dry-docking   
53 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   expenditures continued to be either capitalized as major
modifications or expensed, depending on the work being performed.   Deferred Financing Costs.Deferred
financing costs include costs associated with the issuance of
the Companys debt and are amortized using the effective
interest rate method of amortization over the life of the
related debt agreement or on a straight-line basis over the life
of the related debt agreement if the straight-line method
approximates the effective interest rate method of amortization.   Income Taxes.Deferred income taxes are
provided at the currently enacted income tax rates for the
difference between the financial statement and income tax bases
of assets and liabilities and carryforward items. Management
provides valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets
for amounts which are not considered more likely than
not to be realized. As noted earlier, the Company operates
under the Norway Shipping Regime which defers current taxation
on the Norway income. Although taxes are considered indefinitely
deferred, the Company provides for and classifies as deferred
the future tax liability on the earnings of our Norwegian
subsidiary. As of the Exit Date, the Company incurred a change
of control, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code
Section382 Section382. Accordingly,
the rules of Section382 will limit the utilization of our
NOLs. The Company has the option to compute the limitation
pursuant to two alternatives. The Company may forego any annual
limitation on the utilization of the NOL carryforward by
reducing such NOL carryforward by the amount of interest paid or
accrued over the past three years by the predecessor corporation
on indebtedness that was converted to equity. Under this option,
if another ownership change were to occur before March15,
2007, the entire NOL carryforward would be reduced to zero. This
would have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows.
Alternatively, the Company may elect to apply an annual
limitation on the utilization of the NOL. Under this alternative
election, past interest expense would not reduce the NOL
carryforward and future ownership changes would not eliminate
the NOL carryforward completely. However, the NOL carryforward
would be significantly limited on an annual basis. The
limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the stock
immediately before the ownership change by the applicable
long-term exempt rate. If this option were elected we would be
limited in the utilization of our NOLs to offset approximately
$47million of post-reorganization taxable income per
year. Any unused annual limitation would be carried over to
later years. The amount of the limitation would under certain
circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held
by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the
five-year period after the change. Because the Company recorded
a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets
as of the Exit Date, the utilization of pre-reorganization NOL
carryforwards during periods following our emergence from
bankruptcy will result in income tax expense during the period
in which the NOL carryforwards are used and an increase to
paid-in-capital.   Revenue Recognition.We earn and
recognize revenues primarily from the time and bareboat
chartering of vessels to customers based upon daily rates of
hire. A time charter is a lease arrangement under which we
provide a vessel to a customer and are responsible for all
crewing, insurance and other operating expenses. In a bareboat
charter, we provide only the vessel to the customer, and the
customer assumes responsibility to provide for all of the
vessels operating expenses and generally assumes all risk
of operation. Vessel charters may range from several days to
several years. Other vessel income is generally related to
billings for fuel bunks, meals and other expenses incurred on
behalf of the customer.   Deferred Revenues on Unfavorable
Contracts.During the application of
fresh-start accounting, the Company was required to refer to the
guidance in SFASNo141 to determine the fair value
of its assets and liabilities before the application of negative
goodwill. SFASNo141 requires the Company to record
all contracts that are in process at the Exit Date at fair
market value based on estimated normal profit margins at that
date. As such, an asset for favorable contracts or a liability
for unfavorable contracts is required to be recorded. These
assets or liabilities are then required to be amortized based on
revenues recorded over the remaining contract lives, effectively
resulting in the recognition of a normal profit margin on
contract activity performed subsequent to the acquisition. The
Company performed an evaluation, with the assistance of
third-party specialist, of its contracts and determined that, as
a result of recent market improvements in the North Sea, several
of its contracts were unfavorable compared to market conditions
as of the Exit Date. As a result, the Company recorded deferred
revenues of NOK 1019million $167million at
March15, 2005related to its charter hire contracts
in the North   
54 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   Sea, representing the unfavorable contract amounts discounted to
present values. Accordingly, the Company is required to amortize
the deferred revenue on unfavorable contracts liability by
increasing revenues related to the identified contracts over the
remaining terms of the charters, see Note4.   Direct Vessel Operating
Expenses.Direct vessel operating expenses
principally include crew costs, marine inspection costs,
insurance, repairs and maintenance, supplies and casualty
losses. Operating costs are expensed as incurred. Operating
costs are reduced by the amount of partial reimbursements of
labor costs received from the Norwegian government beginning
during July 2003. The labor reimbursements totaled
$60million, $44million, $12million and
$55million for the year ended December31, 2006, for
the period from March15, 2005 through December31,
2005, the period from January1, 2005 through
March14, 2005 and the year ended December31, 2004,
respectively.   Losses on Insured Claims.The Company
limits its exposure to casualty losses by maintaining stop-loss
and aggregate liability deductibles. Self-insurance losses for
claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued
based upon the Companys historical loss experience and
valuations provided by independent third-party consultants. To
the extent that estimated self-insurance losses differ from
actual losses realized, the Companys insurance reserves
could differ significantly and may result in either higher or
lower insurance expense in future periods.   Foreign Currency Translation.All
assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries are translated into U.S.Dollars at the
exchange rate in effect at the end of the period, and revenue
and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing
during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
reflected within the cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustment component of stockholders equity. The
designated functional currency for our operating segments are as
follows: our U.S.operating segment has the
U.S.Dollar , our North Sea operating segment has the
Norwegian Kroner, our West Africa operating segment has the
Nigerian Naira, our Mexico operating segment has the Mexican
Peso, and Brazil operating segment has the Brazilian Real.   Stock Based Compensation.The Company
adopted the revised version of SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation entitled
Share-Based Payment
SFASNo123R on the Exit Date. Among
other things, this statement requires the fair-value based
method of accounting for equity-based compensation to employees.
Under this method, the Company is required to measure the fair
value of equity-based awards issued to employees at the grant
date and amortize the cost of that award over the period in
which service is rendered.   Prior to the Exit Date, the Company accounted for stock
incentive plans under the recognition and measurement principles
of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. For restricted stock awards, the fair value at
the date of the grant was expensed over the vesting period. For
unrestricted stock awards, compensation expense was recognized
immediately. For stock options, no compensation cost was
reflected in earnings, as all options granted under these plans
had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value
of the underlying common stock on the grant date.   Accumulated other comprehensive income
loss.Accumulated other comprehensive
income loss, which is included as a component of
stockholders equity, is comprised of currency translation
adjustments in foreign subsidiaries and unrecognized pension
gain loss.   Use of Estimates.The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates, and those differences could be material.   New
Accounting Standards.   In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
SFAS159. This statement, which is
expected to expand fair value measurement, permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value. SFAS159 is effective   
55 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   for us beginning in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is
currently assessing the impact SFAS159 may have on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.   In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48
FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
an interpretation of FASB Statement No109. This
interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial
statements in accordance with FASB Statement No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. The interpretation
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure and transition. The provisions of FIN48 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2006. The Company will adopt FIN48 as of January1,
2007, as required. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN48
will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as
applicable. The Company has not completed its analysis of the
adoption of FIN48.   In September 2006, the SEC released SABNo108, which
provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should
quantify financial statement misstatements. Previously, the two
methods most commonly used to quantify misstatements are the
rollover method, which primarily focuses on the
income statement impact of misstatements, and the iron
curtain method, which primarily focuses on the balance
sheet impact of misstatements. Under SABNo108,
registrants are advised to consider both the rollover and iron
curtain methods, which is considered a dual approach, when
evaluating financial statement errors. SABNo108
provides transition accounting and disclosure guidance for
registrants that conclude that a material error existed in
prior-period financial statements under the dual approach.
Specifically, registrants will be permitted to restate prior
period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect
of initially applying SABNo108 through an
adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of
adoption. SABNo108 is effective for annual
financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after
November15, 2006. The adoption of SABNo108
had no impact on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.   On September29, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFASNo158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans SFAS158,
which amends SFAS87 and SFAS106 to require
recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension
and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet.
Under SFAS158, gains and losses, prior service costs and
credits, and any remaining transition amounts under SFAS87
and SFAS106 that have not yet been recognized through net
periodic benefit cost will be recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are
amortized as a component of net periodic cost. The measurement
date, the date at which the benefit obligation and plan assets
are measured, is required to be the companys fiscal year
end. Previously, the North Sea Pension Plans had an
October31 measurement date, which has been changed to the
Companys fiscal year in 2006. SFAS158 is effective
for publicly-held companies for fiscal years ending after
December15, 2006. At adoption of SFAS158, the
Company recognized as accumulated other comprehensive loss, net
of taxes, the net actuarial losses of $09million and the
Norwegian social security obligations of $01million that
arose but were not previously required to be recognized as
components of net periodic benefit cost.   During September 2006 the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements
SFASNo157. SFASNo157
provides a single definition of fair value, together with a
framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure
about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
SFASNo157 emphasizes that fair value is a
market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and
therefore should be determined based on the assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
SFASNo157 sets out a fair value hierarchy and
requires companies to disclose fair value measurements within
that hierarchy. SFASNo157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company does
not expect that the adoption of SFAS157 will have a
significant impact on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.   During February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No155, Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments An Amendment of FASB
Statements No133 and 140. SFASNo155
simplifies the accounting for certain hybrid financial
instruments, eliminates the interim FASB guidance which   
56 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   provides that beneficial interests in securitized financial
assets are not subject to the provisions of
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, and eliminates the
restriction on the passive derivative instruments that a
qualifying special-purpose entity may hold.
SFASNo155 is effective for all financial
instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an
entitys first fiscal year that begins after
September15, 2006. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFASNo155 will have a significant
impact on its consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Fresh-start
Reporting   Fresh-start
Adjustments   In accordance with fresh-start accounting, the reorganization
value of the Company as of the Exit Date was allocated based on
the fair market values of the assets and liabilities. Any excess
of fair value over reorganization value was treated as negative
goodwill, and was applied to reduce the value of long-lived
assets on a pro rata basis. Such fair values represented the
Companys best estimates at the Exit Date based on internal
and independent appraisals and valuations.   To facilitate the calculation of the reorganization value of the
Successor Company, the Company developed a set of financial
projections during 2004. Based on these financial projections,
the reorganization value was determined by the Company, with the
assistance of its financial advisors, using various valuation
methods, including ia comparable company analysis which
estimates the value of the Company based on the implied
valuations of other similar companies that are publicly traded;
iia discounted cash flow analysis which estimates the
value of the Company by determining the current value of
estimated future cash flows to be generated; and iiia
net operating loss carryforwards NOL valuation
analysis which estimated the present value of the tax savings
the NOLs would provide relative to the taxes the reorganized
Debtors would pay absent the application of such NOLs. The
future enterprise value is highly dependent upon achieving the
projected financial results set forth in the projections as well
as the realization of certain other assumptions which are beyond
its control. As confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the estimated
reorganization value of the Company was determined to be
approximately $110million.   As outlined in the table below, in applying fresh-start
accounting, the Company recorded adjustments to reflect the fair
value of assets and liabilities, on a net basis, and to
write-off of the Predecessor Companys equity accounts. In
addition, the excess of fair value of net assets over
reorganization value negative goodwill was
allocated on a pro-rata basis and reduced its non-current
assets, with the exception of financial instruments, in
accordance with SFASNo141. These fresh-start
adjustments resulted in a charge of $2190million. The
restructuring of the Companys capital structure and
conversion of the Senior Notes and related accrued interest into
equity resulted in a gain of $1665million. The charge for
the revaluation of the assets and liabilities and the gain on
the discharge of pre-petition debt are recorded in
Fresh-start adjustments and Gain on debt
discharge, respectively, in the consolidated statement of
operations.   The following table reflects the reorganization adjustments to

to Significant Accounting Policies   Fresh-start accounting requires the selection of appropriate
accounting policies for the Successor Company, which includes
the adoption of any newly issued standards required to be
implemented within twelve months of the Companys emergence
from bankruptcy.   58 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   In accordance with
SOP90-7,
the Company was required to adopt on March15, 2005 all
applicable accounting guidance that will be effective within the
twelve months following the Exit Date. Therefore, the Company
adopted the revised version of SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation entitled
Share-Based Payment
SFASNo123R on the Exit Date. Among
other things, this statement requires the fair-value based
method of accounting for equity-based compensation to employees.
Under this method, the Company is required to measure the fair
value of equity-based awards issued to employees at the grant
date and amortize the cost of that award over the period in
which service is rendered. Previous standards allowed for a
choice of methods to be used for equity-based compensation to
employees. As a result of issuing stock options to employees and
the non-executive chairman of the Board of Directors in
connection with the emergence from bankruptcy, some of which
were immediately vested, the Company recorded approximately $20
and $13million of compensation expense related to the
adoption of SFASNo123R during the twelve months
ended December31, 2006 and the period from March15,
2005 to December31, 2005, respectfully. The following
table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions
of SFASNo123R to stock-based employee compensation

Continued   Also, during fresh-start accounting, the Companys
long-lived assets were adjusted to fair market value and reduced
by the amount of negative goodwill implied in the
reorganization. New book values were determined for the
Companys long-lived assets. On the Exit Date, the Company
revised the useful lives of its long-lived assets to represent
the estimated remaining useful lives at that date. Below is a
table illustrating the depreciable lives for the Predecessor
Company and the Successor Company

Deferred
Revenue on Unfavorable Contracts   During the application of fresh-start accounting, the Company
was required to refer to the guidance in SFASNo141
to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities before
the application of negative goodwill. SFASNo141
required the Company to record all contracts that were in
process at the Exit Date at fair market value based on estimated
normal profit margins at that date. As such, an asset for
favorable contracts or a liability for unfavorable contracts is
required to be recorded. These assets or liabilities were then
required to be amortized based on revenues recorded over the
remaining contract lives, effectively resulting in the
recognition of a normal profit margin on contract activity
performed subsequent to the acquisition. As required, the
Company performed an evaluation of its contracts and determined
that, as a result of recent market improvements in the North
Sea, several of its contracts were unfavorable compared to
market conditions as of the Exit Date. As a result, the Company
recorded deferred revenues of NOK 1019million
$167million at March15, 2005related to its
charter hire contracts in the North Sea, representing the
unfavorable contract amounts discounted to present values.
Accordingly, the Company is required to amortize the deferred
revenue on unfavorable contracts liability by increasing
revenues related to the identified contracts over the remaining
terms of the charters. Although no additional cash benefit is
being recognized by the Company, the reversal of deferred
revenue on unfavorable contracts has had and will continue to
have a positive impact on the Companys stated revenues,
operating income, and net income in the current period and
future periods. During the twelve months ended December31,
2006 and the period from March15, 2005 to
December31, 2005, the Company recorded approximately NOK
277million $45million and NOK 656million
$101million, respectively, of non-cash revenues related
to the amortization of deferred contract revenues. The remaining
liability of NOK 86million $14million is
included in deferred revenues on unfavorable
contracts in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at
December31, 2006. Although the amounts ultimately recorded
will be impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, the
Company expects to record non-cash revenues related to the
amortization of its unfavorable contract liability as follows

share of the Companys new common stock for $1875 and one
SeriesB Warrant representing the

Continued   right to purchase one share of the Companys new common
stock for $2500 for each 74shares of old common stock

499,429 SeriesB Warrants on the Exit Date, of which
495,619 SeriesA Warrants and 497,267 SeriesB
Warrants remain outstanding as of December31, 2006. The
Company has accounted for these warrants as equity instruments
in accordance with EITF

since there is no option for cash or net-cash settlement when
the warrants are exercised. Future exercises and forfeitures

amount of common stock outstanding and additional paid-in
capital.   The aggregate fair value of the warrants at March15, 2005

retention plan, which calls for payments to certain key
employees totaling $10million payable based on service
over a fifteen-month period beginning in December 2004. At the
Exit Date approximately $08million of the key employee
retention plan had vested, subsequent to the Exit Date an
additional $01million has vested and been expensed to
employee bonuses, and $01million has been forfeited. On
each of the Commencement Date and the Exit Date, the Company
made total payments of approximately $05million,
representing the first and second of four vesting dates under
the key employee retention plan. The Company made the third
payment under the employee retention plan in September 2005 of
approximately $03million and the final payment of
approximately $01million in March 2006.

Assets
Held for Sale and Sales of Assets   At December31, 2006 our assets held for sale included
three supply vessels and our SWATH crew boat.   Management moved one active supply vessel to assets held for
sale in the fourth quarter of 2006. The Company entered into a
charter with a purchase option at the end of such charter. In
December 2006, management and the customer have agreed upon the
terms of the purchase option, which the customer will exercise
in January 2007. The vessel is included in assets held for sale
at December31, 2006 at its book value of
$08million, as the estimated fair value exceeded the book
value.   In the fourth quarter of 2006, management committed to a formal
plan to sell two cold-stacked supply vessels. The two vessels
are included in assets held for sale at December31, 2006
at their aggregate book value of $08million, as the
estimated fair value exceeded the book value.   In December 2005, management committed to a formal plan to sell
the Stillwater River, a high speed SWATH crew boat. Based on the
estimated net sale proceeds, the Company recorded an initial
impairment charge of approximately $22million during the
fourth quarter of 2005. Even though the SWATH has been
classified as held for sale for over a year, management has
concluded that the SWATH continues to meet the requirements of
an asset held for sale per SFAS144,
Financial Accounting Standard No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. During
the past year the Company has actively solicited, but did not
receive any reasonable offers to purchase the SWATH; therefore,
in the third quarter of 2006, the Company recorded an additional
impairment of $32million partially offset by
$06million in insurance recoveries received during 2006.
The SWATH continues to be actively marketed at a price
reasonable to the current market conditions   In an effort to reduce costs associated with cold-stacked
vessels and to augment liquidity for operating or investing
needs, the Company initiated the process to actively market five
of its Gulf of Mexico cold-stacked supply vessels for sale. The
Company sold three vessels during the fourth quarter of 2005 for
total net proceeds of $25million, recognizing a gain of
$10million. In April 2006, the Company sold an additional
cold-stacked vessel for net proceeds of approximately
$08million, recognizing a gain of $03million.
After careful analysis, management decided to transfer the
remaining cold-stacked vessel from held for sale during the
second quarter of 2006 and began to destack the vessel for
future use. The Company did not impair the cold-stacked vessel
when transferred to held for sale, nor did the Company make any
subsequent impairment.   The Company had three crew boats under charter with a customer
in Mexico, each of which had a purchase option at the conclusion
of its respective charter at fair market value. Two of the crew
boat charters concluded in March 2006, and the customer
exercised its purchase option with the Company at the agreed
upon price of $06million per vessel, which resulted in a
gain of $07million during the period. In the first
quarter of 2006, the remaining crew boat was transferred to
assets held for sale as the customer exercised the purchase
option in March 2006. The Company completed the sale of the crew
boat during the third quarter of 2006 with an agreed upon
purchase price of $04million, which resulted in a
$02million gain.   During October 2004, the Company began actively marketing a
group of five line handler vessels operating in Brazil. On
May5, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to sell
the five line handler vessels. The agreement   
62 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   to sell the vessels was contingent on approval from the
charterer of the vessels. During November 2005, the charterer
approved the sale, and the sale was completed in December 2005
for current and future proceeds of $16million, resulting
in a net gain of $04million. At the time of purchase, the
buyer remitted an initial payment of $05million and the
Company
set-up a
corresponding note receivable for the remaining
$11million to be collected over a period of four years.   In December 2004, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
transaction for its 14,000square foot primary office in
the North Sea to provide additional liquidity. The sale
generated approximately $28million of net proceeds. The
Company entered into a
10-year
operating lease for the use of the facility, with annual rent
payments of approximately $03million. The lease contains
options, at the Companys discretion, to extend the lease
for an additional six years, as well as a fair-value purchase
option at the end of the lease term.   During the second quarter of 2004, the Company initiated the
process of selling three of its North Sea class platform supply
vessels PSVs that had an average age of
28years. One of the vessels was sold on July8, 2004
for approximately $37million. Based on the Companys
estimated fair value less transaction costs or commissions, the
Company recorded an initial charge of approximately
$87million on the three North Sea class vessels during
the second quarter of 2004 and recorded an additional charge of
approximately $20million during the fourth quarter of
2004 on the remaining two vessels. The Company sold the
remaining two vessels for $16million each during April
and July of 2005, recognizing total gains of $07million.

Impairments   In accordance with the provisions of SFASNo144, the
Company reviews long-lived assets held for use for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. During
the application of fresh-start in March 2005, all vessels were
adjusted to fair market value and reduced by the amount of
negative goodwill implied in the reorganization. New book values
were determined for the Companys vessels. Due to the
application of fresh-start and strong market conditions, the
Company determined that market conditions did not require an
impairment test to be performed during 2006 or 2005 for assets
held for use.   During 2004, due to changes to the Companys operational
reorganization plan as well as the continued low levels of day
rates and utilization in the Companys key market areas
during the first half of the year, the Company determined that a
test for impairment of its vessels was necessary. The Company
records impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use when
the net undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by
those assets are less than the carrying amount. During the
second quarter of 2004, based on the Companys estimates of
discounted cash flows, the Company recorded a charge of
$86million on three of its North Sea class vessels
classified as held for use.

Loan payable in Norwegian Kroner NOK in the amount
of NOK 1500million $241million at
December31, 2006. Amounts borrowed under the NOK Term
Loan bear interest at NIBOR plus 20%. The NOK Term Loan was
required to be repaid in five semi-annual repayments of NOK
75million $12million beginning
September30, 2004. The NOK Term loan was retired upon the
final payment of NOK 70million $113million on
June30, 2006.   The NOK Revolver, with a current facility capacity of NOK
446million $717million, is collateralized by
mortgages on nine North Sea class vessels. The bank facility
contains covenants that require the North Sea operating unit to
maintain certain financial ratios and places limits on the
operating units ability to create liens, or merge or
consolidate with other entities. Since the facility has both a
subjective acceleration clausematerial adverse change
clause and the facility replaces short-term advances with other
short-term advances, the entire outstanding balance of the
credit facility is classified as a current liability in
accordance with SFASNo6. The Company reduced the
availability of the NOK Revolver by NOK 34million
$55million on April20, 2006 as a result of the
pending sale, subsequently completed on June30, 2006, of
two AHTS vessels and two PSV vessels to its minority owned
consolidated subsidiary, Eastern Marine Services Limited
EMSL. As of October31, 2006, the Company
repaid the outstanding balance on the NOK Revolver of NOK
40million $61million; however, this facility is
still available to augment the Companys liquidity.   During December 2004, the Company and its Norwegian lender
agreed on terms to amend several covenants of the NOK Revolver
to exclude intercompany notes from the definition of funded debt
and to increase the maximum ratio of funded debt to operating
income plus depreciation and amortization from 50 to 55. These
covenant modifications increase the Companys ability to
repatriate cash from Norway without incurring a default under
the NOK Revolver. As a result of the modifications, the
Companys effective interest rate increased by 1% on both
facilities. These covenant modifications were effective as of
December31, 2004.   In 1998, Trico Marine International, Inc., the Companys
special-purpose subsidiary, issued $100million of
608%notes due 2006 the 608%Notes, to
finance the construction of the SWATH crew boat. The final
payment of $06million was made in September 2006. In
1999, the subsidiary issued $189million of
611%notes due 2014 the 611%Notes, to
finance the construction of two supply vessels, of which
$94million is outstanding at December31, 2006. The
special-purpose subsidiary is 100% owned by a subsidiary of the
Company and is consolidated in the Companys condensed

Operating
Leases   On September30, 2002, one of the Companys primary
U.S.subsidiaries, Trico Marine Operators, Inc., entered
into a master bareboat charter agreement the Master
Charter with General Electric Capital Corporation
GECC for the sale and lease back of three crew
boats. All obligations under the Master Charter are guaranteed
by Trico Marine Assets, Inc., the Companys other primary
U.S.subsidiary, and Trico Marine Services, Inc, the parent
company. The Master Charter contains covenants that require the
Company to post an additional letter of credit if the SP
credit rating for the Company drops below B-. To satisfy the
additional security provision, the Company provided GECC with a
pledge agreement the Pledge Agreement and
$17million in cash deposits pursuant thereto in lieu of
letters of credit in June 2004. The deposits have been
classified as non-current Other assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.   The Master Charter also contains cross-default provisions, which
could be triggered in the event of certain conditions, or the
default and acceleration of the Company or certain subsidiaries
with respect to any loan agreement which results in an
acceleration of such loan agreement. Upon any event of default
under the Master Charter, GECC could elect to, among other
things, terminate the Master Charter, repossess and sell the
vessels, and require the Company or certain subsidiaries to make
up to a $97million stipulated loss payment to GECC. If
the conditions of the Master Charter requiring the Company to
make a stipulated loss payment to GECC were met, such a payment
could impair the Companys liquidity.   In December 2004, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
transaction for its 14,000square foot primary office in
the North Sea to provide additional liquidity. The Company
entered into a
10-year
operating lease for the use of the facility, with annual rent
payments of approximately $03million. The lease contains
options, at the Companys discretion, to extend the lease
for an additional six years, as well as a fair-value purchase
option at the end of the lease term.   Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating lease
obligations are approximately $21million,
$19million, $18million, $17million,
$15million and $30million for the years ending
December31, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and subsequent

be repatriated and taxable in the Company in the foresable
future. A deferred tax liability will be recognized when the
Company expects that it will realize those undistributed foreign
earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of
dividends or sale of investments. The amount of the unrecognized
deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to
investments in the foreign subsidiary has not been disclosed
because it is impractical to calculate the amount at this time.
In December 2006, $320million in cash was repatriated
from one of our Norwegian Subsidiaries to its parent company,
Trico Marine Cayman L.P. There were no adverse tax consequences
related to this repatriation of cash. We do not anticipate
repatriating funds from our Cayman Island Subsidiary to the
U.S.; we plan to use the funds in the Cayman Islands for future
international expansion. It is not anticipated that we will need
to repatriate any additional funds from Norway in the near

Continued   In accordance with the provisions of SFASNo109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, no net tax benefit was
recorded in the financial statements for the Companys 2006
and 2005 U.S.net operating losses and deferred tax assets,
as management does not consider the benefit to be more likely
than not to be realized.   As discussed in more detail below, the Company incurred
cancellation of debt income and a change of control, as defined
by the Internal Revenue Code, which will limit the ability to
utilize its deferred tax assets related to its NOL
carryforwards. The tax impact of the cancellation of debt income
is shown as a reduction to the tax attributes as of
January1, 2006. The reduced NOL carryfoward related to the
change of control is shown in the table above since the
limitations will be based on an election expected to be made
upon filing of the 2005 U.S.tax return in April 2007.   The provisions benefits for income taxes as reported are

December31, 2006 is primarily associated with income
generated by U.S. and Norwegian operations, alternative minimum
tax, state and foreign taxes. The Companys effective tax
rate for the year ended December31, 2006 differs slightly
from the statutory rate primarily due to income contributed by
the Companys Norwegian subsidiary for which income taxes
were provided at lower rate, alternative minimum tax, state and
foreign taxes due. During 2005, the variance from the
Companys statutory rate was primarily due to the
non-deductibility of fresh-start adjustments and non-inclusion
of the gain on debt discharge, both of which were recorded upon
emergence from bankruptcy. In addition, other non-deductible
losses including restructuring costs, income contributed by
the Companys Norwegian subsidiary for which income taxes
were provided at a lower rate and the U.S.net deferred tax
asset valuation allowance also contributed to the variances from
the statutory rate. In prior years, the variance from the
Companys statutory rate was primarily due to the valuation
allowance on U.S.net deferred tax assets, lack of
deductibility of costs associated with the financial
restructuring and, to a lesser extent, income contributed by the
Companys Norwegian subsidiary for which income taxes were
provided at the Norwegian statutory rate of 28%.   As of December31, 2005, the Company had approximately
$325million in pre-reorganization net operating loss the
NOL carryforwards and $2million in
post-reorganization NOL carryforwards that were scheduled to
expire at various periods through 2024. Upon reorganization, we
recognized cancellation of debt income of $1665million
when our $250million
87/8%senior
notes due 2012 the Senior Notes were converted to
equity. Pursuant to applicable tax law, approximately
$76million of this cancellation of debt reduced the NOL
carryforward. Additionally, the change in our ownership, may
limit the ultimate utilization of our NOLs pursuant to
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code
Section382. An ownership change may result
from, among other things, transactions increasing the ownership
of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more
than 50percentage points over a three-year period.   
69 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   Our reorganization created a change in ownership. Accordingly,
the rules of Section382 will limit the utilization of our
NOLs. The Company has the option to compute the limitation
pursuant to two alternatives. The Company may forego any annual
limitation on the utilization of the NOL carryforward by
reducing such NOL carryforward by the amount of interest paid or
accrued over the past three years by the predecessor corporation
on indebtedness that was converted to equity. Under this option,
if another ownership change were to occur before March15,
2007, the entire NOL carryforward would be reduced to zero. This
would have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows.
Alternatively, the Company may elect to apply an annual
limitation on the utilization of the NOL. Under this alternative
election, past interest expense would not reduce the NOL
carryforward and future ownership changes would not eliminate
the NOL carryforward completely. However, the NOL carryforward
would be significantly limited on an annual basis. The
limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the stock
immediately before the ownership change by the applicable
long-term exempt rate. It is estimated that we will be limited
in the utilization of our NOLs to offset approximately
$47million of post-reorganization taxable income per
year. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later
years. The amount of the limitation may under certain
circumstances be increased by the built-in gains in assets held
by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the
five-year period after the change.   Currently, the Company intends to elect to forego the annual NOL
limitation. However, the Company will fully study its options
before making a decision, which is due upon the filing its 2005
income tax return in April 2007.   The Company has based its tax provision on the assumption that
the annual limitation will not apply. If the annual limitation
were elected, the Company estimates there would be an increase
of approximately $19million in current income taxes
payable as of December31, 2006 based on estimated current
year taxable income. The Company has reserved for any future
benefits that might be derived from its NOL carryforwards and
other deferred tax assets to the extent they exceed its domestic
deferred tax liabilities as of December31, 2006. If the
Company continues to be profitable it is likely we will release
the valuation allowance in 2007.   As noted above, fresh start accounting rules require that
release of the valuation allowance recorded against
pre-confirmation net deferred tax assets is reflected as an
increase to additional paid-in capital. To date, the Company has
released approximately $166million of the valuation
allowance related to the pre-confirmation net deferred tax
asset, which has increased the Companys additional
paid-in-capital
account. If the pre-confirmation net deferred tax asset is used
to offset taxable income in the future, the reduction in the
valuation allowance will be recorded as noted above and the
utilization of the deferred tax asset will be reflected as an
increase to deferred income tax expense.   A valuation allowance was provided against the Companys
U.S.net deferred tax asset as of the reorganization date.
Although the Company recorded a profit from operations during
2006 and from its U.S.operations during the fourth quarter
of 2005, the history of negative earnings from these operations
in the recent past constitutes significant negative evidence
substantiating the need for a full valuation allowance against
the U.S.net deferred tax assets as of December31,
2006. If the Companys U.S. operations continue to be
profitable it is likely we will release the valuation allowance
in 2007.   On March22, 2002, the Companys Brazilian subsidiary
received non-income related a tax assessment from a Brazilian
State tax authority for approximately 258million Reais
$121million at December31, 2006. The tax
assessment is based on the premise that certain services
provided in Brazilian federal waters are considered taxable by
certain Brazilian states as transportation services. The Company
had filed a timely defense at the time of the assessment. In
September 2003, an administrative court upheld the assessment.
In response, the Company filed an administrative appeal in the
Rio de Janeiro administrative tax court during October 2003. In
November 2005, the Companys appeal was submitted to the
Brazilian State attorneys for their response. The Company is
currently waiting for a ruling on its appeal and is under no
obligation to pay the assessment unless and until such time as
all appropriate appeals are exhausted. The Company intends to
vigorously challenge the imposition of this tax. Broader
industry actions have been taken against the tax in the form of
a suit filed at the Brazilian federal supreme court seeking a
declaration that the state statute attempting to tax the
industrys activities is unconstitutional.   
70 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   During the third quarter of 2004, the Company received a
separate non-income related tax assessment from the same
Brazilian State tax authority for approximately 28million
Reais $13million at December31, 2006. This tax
assessment is based on the same premise as noted above. The
Company filed a timely defense during October 2004. In January
2005, an administrative court upheld the assessment. In
response, the Company filed an administrative appeal in the Rio
de Janeiro administrative tax court during February 2006. The
Company has not accrued for either assessment or any potential
interest charges for the liabilities as they are not considered
probable as defined by SFASNo5.   If the Companys challenges to the imposition of these
taxes which may include litigation at the Rio de Janeiro state
court prove unsuccessful, current contract provisions and other
factors could potentially mitigate the Companys tax
exposure. Nonetheless, an unfavorable outcome with respect to
some or all of the Companys Brazilian tax assessments
could have a material adverse affect on the Companys
financial position and results of operations if the potentially
mitigating factors also prove unsuccessful.   The Companys Norwegian subsidiary is a member of the
Norwegian shipping tax regime, which enables the indefinite
deferral of the payment of income taxes as long as certain
criteria are met. If the Company fails to meet these criteria,
the subsidiary may be deemed to have exited the shipping tax
regime and, as a result, a portion of the deferred tax liability
may become due and payable. The Company currently believes that
it is in good standing with the Norwegian shipping tax regime.

and subsequent stock offering. The Companys   
71 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   reorganization, on March15, 2005, included issuing
10,000,000shares of new common stock, issuing 728,000
options to purchase new common stock and restricted stock to
employees and directors and converting the Companys
previous common shares into approximately 1,000,000 warrants to
purchase shares of new common stock. In October 2005, the
Company issued 4,273,500shares of common stock during an
underwritten public offering.   For the year ended December31, 2006, options to purchase
57,500shares of common stock at prices ranging from $2713
and $3556per share were excluded from the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the proceeds from exercise of
these options, including the unrecognized compensation, exceeded
the average stock price and inclusion of these shares would have
been antidilutive.   For the period from March15, 2005 to December31,
2005, 497,438 warrants to purchase shares of common stock were
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
because the warrants exercise price of $2500 was greater
than the average market price of common shares for that period.
For the period from January1, 2005 to March14, 2005,
options to purchase 1,077,800shares of common stock at
prices ranging from $205 to $2313 and 53,333shares of
unvested restricted stock have been excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share because inclusion of
these shares would have been antidilutive.

Equity
Incentive Plans   Prior to the reorganization, the Company sponsored three
stock-based incentive compensation plans, the 1993 Stock
Option Plan the 1993 Plan, the 1996
Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan and the
non-employee director stock-based incentive compensation plan
the Director Plan. On the Exit Date, the 1993
Plan, 1996 Plan and the Director Plan were terminated and all
unvested stock options under the plans were cancelled. No shares
were granted or exercised between December31, 2004 and the
Exit Date.   On March15, 2005, the Company adopted the Trico Marine
Services, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the 2004
Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, the Company is authorized to
issue shares of new common stock pursuant to Awards
granted as incentive stock options qualified under
Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, non-qualified stock options, restricted and
unrestricted stock awards, or any combination of such Awards.
Awards may be granted to key employees and directors of the
Company. The Compensation Committee administers the 2004 Plan
and has broad discretion in selecting 2004 Plan participants and
determining the vesting period and other terms for Awards
granted under the 2004 Plan. According to the 2004 Plan, Awards
may be granted with respect to a maximum of
1,500,000shares of new common stock.   Options   The estimated weighted average fair value of options granted
during 2006 and 2005 was $1176 and $506per share,
respectively. The fair value of each stock option granted is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes value
method of option pricing with the following weighted-average
assumptions

recognized approximately $06million and
$13million, respectively, in compensation costs related
to stock option grants under the 2004 Plan. No net tax benefits
were recorded for the options since the Company provides for a
full valuation allowance against its U.S.net deferred tax
assets. The Company expects to recognize approximately
$12million in compensation expense over the next two
years related to options that are outstanding but not yet vested
as of December31, 2006.   Restricted

Employee
Benefit Plans   Defined
Contribution Plan   The Company has a defined contribution profit sharing plan under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code the
Plan that covers substantially all
U.S.employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Employees may contribute any percentage of their eligible
compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain ERISA
limitations. The Company will match 25% of the
participants before tax savings contributions on up to 5%
of the participants taxable wages or salary. The Company
may also make an additional matching contribution to the Plan at
its discretion. The Company expensed contributions to the Plan
for the year ended December31, 2006, the period from
March15, 2005 through December31, 2005, the period
from January1, 2005 through March14, 2005, and the
year ended December31, 2004 of approximately
$02million, $02million, zero, and
$01million, respectively.   Norwegian
Pension Plans   Substantially all of the Companys Norwegian employees are
covered by three non-contributory, defined benefit pension
plans. Benefits are based primarily on participants
compensation and years of credited services. The Companys
policy is to fund contributions to the plans based upon
actuarial computations.

Continued   Adoption
of SFASNo158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans   In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFASNo158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The
Company adopted SFASNo158, which was effective by
the year ended December31, 2006.   The adoption of SFAS158 required the Company to recognize
the over-funded pension asset and the under-funded pension
liability on the consolidated balance sheet. This amount is
defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligation. The Company recognized as
accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, the
actuarial gains and losses and Norwegian social security
obligations that arose but were not previously required to be
recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. In
subsequent periods, other comprehensive income will be adjusted
as these amounts are recognized into income as components of net
periodic benefit cost.   The following table summarizes the initial impact upon adoption
of SFASNo158 on the consolidated balance sheet.

Continued   United
Kingdom Pension Plan   Substantially all of the Companys United Kingdom employees
are covered by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund the
MNOPF Plan, a non-contributory, multiemployer
defined benefit pension plan. Plan actuarial valuations are due
to occur every three years, and it is possible that the MNOPF
will issue additional invoices to the Company depending on the
results of future actuarial valuations. The most recent
actuarial review of the MNOPF determined there was a funding
deficit for the 2003 valuation between $2683million and
$6052million. The Companys portion of this deficit
is estimated to be between 04% and 05%. The actuarial review
of the MNOPF funding deficit is currently under review by
participating employers; thus, the Companys share can not
be determined at this time. As of December31, 2006, based
on the Companys best estimate, a funding obligation of
$11million was reserved.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the period from
March15, 2005 though December31, 2005, the period
from January1, 2005 through March14, 2005, and the
year ended December31, 2004, the Company recognized a cost
of $11million, $05million, zero, $27million
respectively, for the MNOPF Plan, which amounts represent
assessments of current obligations to the MNOPF Plan.   The Company expects to contribute $11million to the MNOPF
pension plan in 2007.

Minority
owned consolidated subsidiary   On June30, 2006, the Company entered into a long term
shareholders agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of China
Oilfield Services Limited COSL for the purpose of
providing marine transportation services for offshore oil and
gas exploration, production and related construction and
pipeline projects mainly in Southeast Asia. As a result of this
agreement, the companies formed a limited liability company,
Eastern Marine Services Limited EMSL, located in
Hong Kong. The Company owns a 49% interest in EMSL, and COSL
owns a 51% interest.   EMSL will be managed pursuant to the terms of its shareholders
agreement which provides for equal representation for COSL and
the Company on the board and in management. In exchange for its
49% interest in EMSL, the Company agreed to contribute fourteen
vessels. Ten of these vessels were contributed at the first
closing on June30, 2006. During the second closing,
scheduled to occur in January 2008, the Company will contribute
the remaining four supply vessels. COSL made a capital
contribution to EMSL of approximately $209million in cash
in exchange for its 51% interest. In exchange for the
Companys contribution of 14vessels EMSL paid the
Company approximately $179million, $35million of
which is held in escrow until the second closing. Of the initial
fleet of ten vessels, five Gulf class supply vessels will be
operating in China under bareboat arrangements between COSL and
EMSL and the Company will bareboat the remaining five vessels
from EMSL until the later of December31, 2007 or the
expiry of any then existing contracts for such vessels. Upon the
second closing, another two Gulf class supply vessels will be
operating in China under bareboat arrangements between COSL and
EMSL and the remaining two vessels in EMSLs fleet will be
targeted for operations in Southeast Asia markets. Upon expiry
of bareboat arrangements with the Company, those five vessels
will also be targeted for operations in Southeast Asia markets
by EMSL.   There is potential for the Company to provide subordinated
financial support as required per the shareholders agreement to
fund, in proportion to the shareholders respective
ownership percentages, project
start-up
costs associated with the development and establishment of EMSL
to the extent they exceed the working capital of EMSL.   The Company followed the guidance in FASB issued Interpretation
No46R revised December 2003, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities FIN46R and has
determined that EMSL should be consolidated by the Company. The
focus of FIN46R is on controlling financial interests that
may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting
interests. FIN46R concludes that in the absence of clear
control through voting interest, a companys exposure
variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards
from the variable interest entity   
78 Table of Contents   NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   are the best evidence of control. The entity that holds the
majority interest in the variable interest entity is considered
the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the
variable interest entity.   The Company has determined that EMSL is a variable interest
entity and has concluded that at inception it was the primary
beneficiary based on terms in the shareholders agreement.   At June30, 2006 the Company contributed marine vessels and
other assets to EMSL with a historical book value of
$309million. COSL contributed $209million, of
which $179million was then paid to Trico. At formation,
EMSLs assets totaled $339million. A
$36million gain was generated by the Company based on the
difference between the cash proceeds of $209million and
51% of the book value of the EMSLs assets. The Company has
determined that gain recognition would be inappropriate based on
the guidance in SABTopic 5H and SAB84
Accounting for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary, and
as a result has recorded the $36million as additional
paid-in-capital
and decreased the non-controlling interest on the condensed
consolidated balance sheet.   Upon inception at June30, 2006, the formation of EMSL had

Commitments
and Contingencies   Leif Weizmanv. Trico Marine Services, Inc., Thomas E.
Fairley, and Ronald O. Palmer; U.S.District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana. On June4, 2004, a punitive
class-action
lawsuit was filed against the Company, Thomas E. Fairley, the
Companys former Chief Executive Officer, and Ronald O.
Palmer, the Companys former Chairman of the Board of
Directors, in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Louisiana the District Court. The
lawsuit asserts a claim under section10b of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
Rule10b-5
thereunder for an unasserted amount of damages on behalf of a
class of individuals who purchased Company common stock between
May6, 2003 and May10, 2004. Plaintiffs alleged that
the Company and the individual defendants made misstatements and
omissions concerning the Companys future earnings
prospects. Although the Company denies these allegations, the
Company entered negotiations to settle the lawsuit to avoid
distractions to management and to reduce legal fees in future
periods. During April 2005, the District Court preliminarily
approved a settlement which involves the creation of a
settlement fund in the amount of $06million and requires
the Company to implement certain other corporate governance
related enhancements. On August23, 2005, the District
Court issued a final judgment order dismissing the lawsuit
against the Company, the Companys former Chief Executive
Officer and the Companys former Chairman of the Board of
Directors with prejudice. In addition, the District Court
approved the terms of the settlement described above and ordered
the settling parties to consummate the terms and provisions of
the settlement.   On March31, 2006, the Company entered into a contract to
construct a Marin Teknikk Design MT6009 MKII platform supply
vessel for a total cost of approximately NOK 167million
$268million as of December31, 2006. This vessel
will incorporate diesel electric propulsion and Dynamic
Positioning 2 DP-2 certification and clean and comfort class
and will have large carrying capacity anticipated to be 3,300
deadweight tons. The vessels estimated completion and
expected delivery date will be in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Under the terms of the contract, the Company paid an initial 20%
deposit in April 2006 and will pay the remaining 80% at delivery
date. The initial 20% deposit of NOK 334million
$54million as of December31, 2006and
related capitalized interest of NOK 09million
$01million as of December31, 2006is
currently classified on the condensed consolidated balance sheet
as
construction-in-progress.
The purchase price is subject to certain adjustments based on
the timing of delivery and the vessels specifications upon
delivery, which will not materially alter the purchase price of
the vessel.   On September1, 2006, the Company entered into contracts to
construct two GPA 640 design 210-foot diesel electric powered
platform supply vessels for a total cost of approximately
$352million. The vessels will have diesel electric
propulsion and class2 dynamic positioning systems. The
expected delivery date for the first vessel is in March 2008,
and the second vessel is scheduled to be delivered in July 2008.
The agreement guarantees the construction costs of the vessels
as well as technical specifications and contains penalties for
late delivery. As of December31, 2006, based on the
completion of certain milestones within each contract by the
builder, the Company remitted payments of approximately $89 for
the construction of the two vessels, which are classified on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as
construction-in-progress.   The purchase price for each vessel is subject to certain
adjustments based on the timing of delivery and the
vessels specifications upon delivery, which will not
materially alter the purchase price of the vessels.   The Company expects to fund construction costs related to each
vessel from cash flow from operations.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in
certain personal injury, pollution and property damage claims
and related threatened or pending legal proceedings. The Company
does not believe that any of these proceedings, if adversely
determined, would have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Additionally certain claims would be covered under the
Companys insurance policies. Management, after review with
legal counsel and insurance representatives, is of the opinion
these claims and legal proceedings will be resolved within the
limits of the Companys insurance coverages. At
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, the Company
accrued for liabilities in the amount of approximately
$31million and $34million, respectively, based
upon the gross amount that management believes it may be
responsible for paying in connection with these matters. The
amounts the Company will ultimately be responsible for paying in
connection with these matters could differ materially from
amounts accrued.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments and Market Risks   The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been
determined by the Company using available market information and
valuation methodologies described below. However, considerable
judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
herein may not be indicative of the amounts that the Company
could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different
market assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a
material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.   Cash, cash equivalents and accounts
receivable:The carrying amounts approximate fair
value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.   Debt:The carrying amounts of the
Companys variable rate debt approximate fair value because
the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by
reference to market rates. The fair value of the Companys
fixed rate debt is based on quoted market prices, where
available, or discounted future cash flows based on the
Companys current incremental borrowing rates for similar
types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet date.
The carrying amounts and fair values of debt, including accrued
interest, as of December31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows

political or country risks inherent in doing business in some
countries. These risks may include actions of governments
especially those newly appointed and contract loss. The
Company considers these risks carefully in connection with its
investing and operating activities.   Foreign Currency Risk:The Companys
international operations are subject to certain risks, including
currency fluctuations and government actions. Exposures
primarily relate to assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies as well as the risk that currency
fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows
generated in foreign currencies. To mitigate this risk in the
future, the Company may consider utilizing short-term forward
contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk.
There were no contracts outstanding at December31, 2006
and 2005.

Segment
and Geographic Information   The Company is a provider of marine vessels and related services
to the oil and gas industry. Substantially all revenues result
from the charter of vessels owned or leased by the Company. The
Companys reportable segments are based on criteria
provided by SFASNo131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
SFASNo131. The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies except for purposes of income
taxes and intercompany transactions and balances. The North Sea
segment provides for taxes at a rate of 28%, which is the
Norwegian statutory tax rate. Additionally, segment data
includes intersegment revenues, receivables and payables, and
investments in consolidated subsidiaries.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   The Companys key factor for evaluating performance is
operating income loss. In July of 2006, the Company
implemented organizational changes to its management structure
to enhance the way the Company evaluates segment operating
income loss performance. The Companys chief operating
decision maker currently evaluates operating income loss
performance based on the operating location of the segment.
Prior to July of 2006, the chief operating decision maker
measured operating income loss performance by grouping
segments into the following categories: U.S., North Sea and
Other.   The U.S.segment represents the domestic operations; the
North Sea segment includes operations in Norway and the United
Kingdom; the West Africa segment represent operations in West
Africa; and the Other segment includes primarily the
Companys operations in Mexico, Brazil and China which are
currently combined due to materiality. The 2005 and 2004 segment
data reported has also been updated to reflect the
Companys change in segment evaluation.   Segment data as of and for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows in thousands

Company completed the transfer pricing study in 2006 and
determined it would change the allocation of these costs in
2005. The Company did not allocate corporate general and
administrative cost for 2004. If such allocation were preformed

Subsequent
Events   Senior
Convertible Debentures   On February7, 2007, we issued $1250million of
3%senior convertible debentures due in 2027. On
February12, 2007 the purchasers of the debentures
exercised the purchase option for an additional
$250million in purchase options.   The debentures will be exchangeable into cash and, if
applicable, shares of the our common stock, par value
$01per share, based on an initial conversion rate of
230216shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount
of debentures which is equal to an initial conversion price of
approximately $4344per share, subject to adjustment and
certain limitations. If converted, holders will receive cash up
to the principal amount, and, if applicable, excess conversion
value will be delivered in common shares. Holders may convert
their debentures at their option at any time prior to the close
of business on the business day immediately preceding the
maturity date only under the following circumstances:
1prior to January15, 2025, on any date during any
fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter commencing
after March31, 2007, if the last reported sale price of
our common stock is greater than or equal to 125% of the base
conversion price of the debentures for at least 20 trading days
in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter; 2during the
five
business-day
period after any 10 consecutive
trading-day
period the measurement period in which the trading
price of $1,000 principal amount of debentures for each trading
day in the measurement period was less than 98% of the product
of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the
applicable conversion rate on such trading day; 3if the
debentures have been called for redemption; or 4upon the
occurrence of specified corporate transactions set forth in the
Indenture. Holders may also convert their debentures at their
option at any time beginning on January15, 2025, and
ending at the close of business on the business day immediately
preceding the maturity date. The conversion rate will be subject
to adjustments in certain circumstances. In addition, following
certain corporate transactions that also constitute a
fundamental change as defined in the Indenture, we will
increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert
its debentures in connection with such corporate transactions in
certain circumstances.   The debentures will bear interest at a rate of 3%per year
payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of
each year beginning July15, 2007. The debentures will
mature on January15, 2027, unless earlier converted,
redeemed or repurchased.   We may not redeem the debentures before January15, 2012.
On or after January15, 2012, we may redeem for cash all or
a portion of the debentures at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed plus accrued
and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.
In addition, holders may require us to purchase all or a portion
of their debentures on each of January15, 2014, January 15
2017 and January15, 2022. In addition, if we experience
specified types of corporate transactions, holders may require
us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures. Any
repurchase of the debentures pursuant to these provisions will
be for cash at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the debentures to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest
to the date of repurchase.   The debentures are senior unsecured obligations of the Company
and rank equally in right of payment to all of the
Companys other existing and future senior indebtedness.
The debentures are effectively subordinated to all of

Continued   our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of
the value of our assets collateralizing such indebtedness and
any liabilities of our subsidiaries. The debentures and shares
of the common stock, assumable in certain circumstances upon the
conversion of the debentures have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. We sold the debentures to the initial
purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration
provided by Section42 of the Securities Act. The initial
purchasers then sold the debentures to qualified institutional
buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by
Rule144A under the Securities Act. We relied on these
exemptions from registration based in part on representations
made by the initial purchasers in the purchase agreement.   Assets
held for Sale Update   In January 2007, the three supply vessels that were classified
as held for sale at December31, 2006 were sold above their
respective book values. The Company will recognize an aggregate
gain of $23million related to the sale of these vessels
