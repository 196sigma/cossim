35 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders,
SonoSite, Inc.: 
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SonoSite, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity and comprehensive
loss for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the financial statement schedule listed in a. These
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of SonoSite, Inc.s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. 
In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SonoSite, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Business Overview 
SonoSite
commenced operations as a division of ATL Ultrasound, Inc., or ATL. We were
formed to develop the design and specifications for a high-performance,
hand-carried ultrasound imaging system and other mobile ultrasound products for
diagnostic imaging in a multitude of clinical and field settings. On April 6,
1998 the Distribution Date, we became an independent, publicly owned
company through a distribution of one new share of our stock for every three
shares of ATL stock held as of that date. ATL retained no ownership in SonoSite
following the spin-off. 
Initially,
we sold our products primarily through medical product distributors worldwide.
In February 2000, we established a contract direct sales force focused exclusively
on selling our products within the United States. In the first quarter of 2001,
we elected to convert our contract selling force to direct employees and to
expand the number of direct sales people domestically. 
During
2001, we established wholly owned subsidiaries, SonoSite, Ltd., in the United
Kingdom, and SonoSite France SARL in France. During 2002, we established wholly
owned subsidiaries, SonoSite GmbH in Germany and SonoSite Iberica, S.L. in
Spain. Each subsidiary is chartered to develop direct selling operations within
their assigned territories. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation
The
consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of SonoSite, Inc., and our wholly
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the financial statements,
management must make estimates and make assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 
Reclassification of prior period balances
Certain
amounts reported in previous periods have been reclassified to conform to
current period presentation. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and
cash equivalents consist of money market accounts with major U.S. banks and
highly liquid debt instruments with original or remaining maturities at
purchase of three months or less. 
Investment securities 
Investment
securities consist of high-grade U.S. government or corporate debt and
high-grade asset-backed securities. While our intent is to hold our securities
until maturity, we classify all securities as available-for-sale, as the sale
of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management
strategies. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized
gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss
until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale
securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. 
A decline
in market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is
determined to be other than temporary results in a revaluation of its carrying
amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost
basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or
accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using
the effective interest method. Interest income is recognized when earned. 
Accounts receivable 
In the
ordinary course of business, we grant credit to a broad customer base. Of the
accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2003, 52% and 48% were receivable
from international and domestic parties, prior to any allowance for 
41 doubtful accounts. The same percentages as of December 31, 2002 were
51% and 49% prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts. 
The
following table presents individual customers whose outstanding receivable
balance as a percentage of total trade receivables and/or revenue as a
percentage of total revenue exceeded 10% as of, and for the year ended, December 31

We
maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from
the inability of our customers to make required payments. When we determine
that amounts owed from customers are uncollectible, such amounts are charged
off against the allowances for doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of
our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The
carrying value of our financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain long-term other
assets, approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
Other long-term assets approximate fair value as interest rates on these items
approximate market. Investment securities are carried at fair value.
We utilize
foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency
risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany
accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies. We recognize all
derivative financial instruments foreign currency forward contracts in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 133
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in earnings
unless hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivative instruments designated
as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative
instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivative
instruments designed as cash flow and net investment hedges, the effective
portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other
comprehensive income. The ineffective portions are recognized in earnings. 
Inventories 
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out method.
Included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our
sales representatives and marketing department, and items that have been
shipped to customers for which revenue recognition requirements have not been
met including products whose title and custody have passed to the customer.
Adjustments to cost are recorded for obsolete material, earlier generation
products and refurbished product held either as saleable inventory or as
demonstration product. The adjustments reduce their carrying values to amounts
not lower than that which is expected to result in approximately normal profit margins
upon sale. Inventory items for which title has passed to customers are
evaluated for recoverability based on the same process we use to evaluate
collection of accounts receivable. If market conditions are less favorable than
those projected by management, additional downward inventory cost adjustments
may be required.
Property and equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, with
additions and improvements to property and equipment capitalized.
Depreciation
and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over estimated
useful lives as follows 
Asset
Estimated Useful Lives
Equipment, other than
computer
37 years
Software
3 years
Computer equipment
35 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of estimated useful
life or expected remaining lease term
42 Direct
internal and external costs for computer software developed for internal use
are capitalized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position, or SOP, 98-1, Accounting for Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized costs
are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
beginning when each module is complete and ready for use. Such costs are
insignificant for all periods presented. 
The
carrying value of long-lived assets is evaluated for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances occur, which may indicate the carrying amount of the
asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate the carrying value of the assets by
comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use
of the asset and its eventual disposition with the assets reported net book
value. 
Investment in and receivable from affiliates 
When we
have investments in companies where we have the ability to exercise influence
over, but not control, operating and financial policies, these investments are
accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, our share in the net income
or loss in these investees is included in other income or loss. 
We have a
40% ownership interest in a joint venture in China that is currently inactive
and is in the process of being dissolved. At December 31, 2003, our carrying
values for both our investment in this joint venture and receivable from this
joint venture were zero. In 2003, we
entered into a new joint venture in China with a new partner in which we have a
30% ownership interest. At December 31,
2003, the carrying value of this investment was approximately $4,000, which is included in other long-term assets, and the
receivable from this investee was approximately $246,000, which is included in accounts receivable. At December 31, 2003,
we owed the investee approximately $54,000 for commissions related to sales of
our products.
Concentration of credit and supply risk
Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable.
We depend
on some single-source suppliers to provide highly specialized parts and other
components, and may experience an interruption of supply if a supplier is
unable or unwilling to meet our time, quantity and quality requirements. There
are relatively few alternative sources of supply for some of these items. A
change in demand for some parts by other companies in our industry could also
interrupt our supply of components. For example, in March 2003, one of
our component suppliers, Philips Semiconductor, or Philips, informed us that,
commencing in September 2003, it would discontinue production of our integrated
circuit chips using 035-micron technology.
We have designed and implemented a new chip using 02-micron technology
that will continue to be produced by Philips to replace all but one of the
discontinued chips. We expect to design
and implement an additional new chip to replace the remaining 035-micron chip
by early 2005. In the second quarter of
2003, we entered into a purchase commitment totaling approximately $36 million
for supplies of 035-micron chips from Philips for our anticipated
manufacturing needs until new chips have been incorporated in all of our
products. We pay for these chips at the
time deliveries are made to us. As of December 31, 2003, our remaining purchase
commitment was approximately $34 million. On December 31, 2004, we are
required to take possession of, and pay for, the balance of the undelivered
chips. Demand for our products, however, may exceed our forecasts, in which
case we would require additional 035-micron chips to manufacture additional
products. Conversely, if demand for our
products falls short of our forecasts, we may experience excess inventory of
035-micron chips. If our actual demand
for these chips varies significantly from our forecasted demand, we may
experience delays in manufacturing, lost sales, a write-down of inventory or a
deterioration in gross margin.
In
addition, we have transferred the production of our main circuit board to one
of the worlds largest electronic manufacturing services suppliers who will
produce the board in their Thailand manufacturing facility. We expect his transfer to be completed in
the first quarter of 2004. If, as a
result of this transfer, we experience delays in the receipt of this component,
a deterioration in product yields or an increase in costs, we may experience
delays in manufacturing, lost sales or a deterioration in gross margin.
Revenue recognition
We
recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an
agreement with a customer, risk of loss and title have passed to the customer
and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. For service
contracts, revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. Sales discounts
are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Deferred revenue primarily represents
unearned revenue from service contracts made under agreements with customers.
Our typical warranty period is one year and is included with the original
purchase of our ultrasound imaging systems. However, the customer can purchase
a service contract from us to extend the original warranty period or enhance
its 
43 coverage. We accrue charges for related product warranty expenses based
upon estimated costs to repair or replace products sold. These expenses to date
have not been significant. 
In
connection with sales to certain specific international customers, we sometimes
conclude that full collection of the related accounts receivable is not
reasonably assured due to extended payment terms or the financial condition of
our customer and, consequently, we do not recognize revenue or cost of revenues
at the time of title transfer. In instances where collection is not reasonably
assured, revenue and cost of revenue is recorded when cash is received. Additionally,
in cases of nonstandard delivery and acceptance criteria, we will not recognize
revenue at shipment, but rather when the delivery and acceptance criteria have
been satisfied.
Our sales
arrangements may contain multiple elements, which include hardware and software
products. Revenue from the sale of
software in these arrangements is recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-9, Software Revenue
Recognition with Respect to Certain Arrangements. In general, we have vendor
specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value for our hardware and software
products. Accordingly, for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have VSOE of the elements, revenue
equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is
not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer. 
Research and development
Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
Advertising costs
We expense
costs for advertising and promotional activities as incurred. Advertising and
promotional expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
$50 million, $47 million and $43 million. 
Income taxes
Deferred
income taxes are provided based on the estimated future tax effects of
temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards arising subsequent to the Distribution Date. 
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount, if any, expected to be realized. 
Stock-based compensation
At December
31, 2003, we had five stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described in Note 8. We account for those plans under the intrinsic value
method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board, or
APB, Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly,
compensation cost related to stock option grants to employees has been
recognized only to the extent that the fair market value of the stock exceeds
the exercise price of the stock option at the date of the grant. The following
table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation in thousands,

Basic and
diluted net loss per share was computed by dividing the net loss by the
weighted average common shares outstanding exclusive of unvested restricted
shares. 
As more
fully described in Note 8, we have an Adjustment Plan, which includes options
granted in connection with the spin-off distribution occurring on April 6,
1998. As part of this distribution, existing ATL option holders received one of
our options for every six ATL options held. Outstanding Adjustment Plan options
to purchase our shares, our unvested restricted shares issued by ATL and
options issued by us were not included in the computations of diluted net loss
per share because to do so would be antidilutive. As of December 31, 2003,
outstanding Adjustment Plan options totaled 52,840 and outstanding options we
issued totaled 2,866,833. As of December 31, 2002 outstanding Adjustment Plan
options totaled 86,645 and outstanding options we issued totaled 2,815,101. As
of December 31, 2001, outstanding Adjustment Plan options and unvested
restricted shares issued by ATL through the Distribution Date totaled 115,537
and 459 and outstanding options we issued totaled 2,505,651.

The
functional currencies of our international subsidiaries are the local currency

denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the
balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and expenses of international operations
are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. Net
realized and unrealized gains on currency transactions were $346,000 for the
year-ended December 31, 2003 and none for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001.
Recent accounting pronouncements
In June
2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting
requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived
assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability
for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. SFAS
No. 143 is effective for our 2003 fiscal year and we adopted SFAS No. 143 on
January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
In November
2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting
and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of Statement No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantors accounting for, and
disclosure of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. For certain
guarantees issued after December 31, 2002, FIN 45 requires a guarantor to
recognize, upon issuance of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligations it assumes under the guarantee. Guarantees issued prior to January
1, 2003, are not subject to liability recognition, but are subject to expanded
disclosure requirements. The adoption of this interpretation did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
45 In November
2002, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables, with respect to determining when and how to allocate
revenue from sales with multiple deliverables. The EITF 00-21 consensus
provides a framework for determining when and how to allocate revenue from
sales with multiple deliverables based on a determination of whether the
multiple deliverables qualify to be accounted for as separate units of
accounting. The consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered
into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003 and we adopted this consensus
on July 1, 2003. The adoption of this consensus did not have a material impact
on our consolidated financial
statements.
In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, or FIN 46, Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities. Variable interest entities often are created
for a single specified purpose, for example, to facilitate securitization,
leasing, hedging, research and development, or other transactions or
arrangements. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated
Financial Statements, defines what these variable interest entities are and
provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise
should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to
consolidate that entity. Generally, FIN 46 applies to variable interest
entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in
which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. On October8,
2003, the FASB deferred the implementation date for the consolidation
requirements of FIN 46 as it relates to variable interest entities that existed
before February1, 2003. FIN46 also requires companies that expect
to consolidate a variable interest entity they acquired before February1,
2003 to disclose the entitys nature, size, activities, and the companys
maximum exposure to loss in financial statements issued after January31,
2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN46R with respect to variable
interest entities created before January 31, 2003, which, among other things,
revised the implementation date to the fiscal year or interim period ending
after March 15, 2004, except for Special Purpose Entities. The adoption of this
interpretation did not have an impact on our consolidated financial
statements nor do we expect that it will have a material impact on our
future consolidated financial statements.
In May
2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS
No. 150 changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that, under
previous guidance, could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity, by now
requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some
circumstances in the balance sheet. SFAS No. 150 is effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and
otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning
after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
3. Arrangements with ATL 
We entered
into several agreements with ATL effective as of the Distribution Date. These
agreements were negotiated between our chief executive officer and the chief
executive officer of ATL. Both parties considered the terms of these agreements
competitive with the cost of obtaining such rights and services in arms-length
negotiations with third parties. The following is a summary of the significant
agreements: 
OEM Supply Agreement 
During 1999
and the first half of 2000, ATL produced many of our products, including our
systems and most of our transducers. During the fourth quarter of 2000, we
completed the transitioning of our manufacturing operations from ATL to our own
facility. This included transferring equipment, personnel and inventory. We do
not expect any further payments to be made to ATL as a result of this contract.
Technology Transfer and License Agreement 
We entered
into a technology transfer and license agreement with ATL pursuant to which we
took ownership of certain ultrasound technology developed as part of a
government grant and also patent rights, which had been established or were
being pursued for that technology. As part of this agreement, we also entered
into a cross-license whereby we had the exclusive right to use certain ATL
technology existing on April 6, 1998 or developed by ATL during the three-year
period following April 6, 1998 in ultrasound systems weighing 15 pounds or
less, and ATL had the exclusive right to use our technology existing on April
6, 1998 or developed by us during the same three-year period in ultrasound
systems weighing more than 15 pounds. On April 6, 2003, this cross-license became
nonexclusive and, except for the patented technology of each party, now extends
to all ultrasound systems regardless of weight. 
Our
license from ATL bears a royalty equivalent to a percentage of the net sales of
ultrasound products under fifteen pounds that use ATL technology. Royalty
payments are required through September 2007. If prior to April 6, 2006, any
single person or entity engaged in the medical diagnostic imaging business,
other than through the sale or manufacture of our products, obtains, directly
or indirectly, voting control of a majority of our common stock or the power to
elect our 
46 entire board of directors, we will be required to pay $75 million to
ATL. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we incurred a
royalty expense to ATL of $22 million, $18 million and $13 million, which is
included in cost of revenue.

6. Investments in and receivables from
affiliates 
In 1999, we
made an initial capital contribution of $400,000 in the form of inventory into
SonoSite China Limited SonoSite China for a 40% ownership interest. We
accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting. SonoSite China is currently in the process
of being dissolved. As of December 31, 2003, our net investment balance in
SonoSite China was zero. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
we recognized revenue from sales to SonoSite China in the amount of $0 262,000 and $303,000. 
In 2000, we
invested $500,000 for a 199% common stock investment in a company from which
we were also contracting for direct sales services. We used the equity method
of accounting for this investment. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we decided to
terminate our business relationship with this affiliate when we decided to
discontinue the direct sales contract and hire the contractors as employees in
early 2001. We then accelerated our amortization of excess acquisition cost of
$475,000 to fully amortize the remaining balance in the fourth quarter of 2000
when we made this decision. We paid $10 million in 2001 for contract direct
sales service expenses and fees to transfer their direct sales representatives
to us. We paid them $34 million in 2000 for direct sales contract services. In
2002, we sold our ownership in the entity for a nominal amount. 
In 2003, we
invested $90,000 into SonoSite China Medical Limited SonoSite China Medical
for a 30% ownership interest. We
account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 2003, our net
48 investment balance in SonoSite China Medical was approximately $4,000.
For the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized revenue from sales to
SonoSite China Medical in the amount of $329,000.
7. Hedging activities
We
periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact
of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange
rate changes. We do not enter into any derivative transaction for speculative
purposes. These contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net
investment hedges under SFAS No. 133 and therefore, are marked-to-market with
changes in fair value recorded to earnings. These contracts are entered into
for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures, generally three
months. Any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would be
largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transactions. 
The
currencies hedged during 2003 were the British Pound and the Euro. On December
31, 2003, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts totaling $87
million. All of these contracts expire on March 31, 2004 and serve as hedges of
a substantial portion of our British Pound and Euro-denominated intercompany
balances.The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2003 was
nominal.
Net
recognized losses from foreign currency forward contracts totaled $729,000
during 2003 and are included in other income or loss in the consolidated
statements of operations. We did not enter into any derivative instruments in
2002 or 2001. 
8. Shareholders equity 
Stock option plans 
As of
December 31, 2003, we had the following stock compensation plans: the 1998
Nonofficer Employee Stock Option Plan 1998 NOE Plan, the 1998 Stock Option
1998 Plan, the Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan Director Plan,
the Management Incentive Compensation Plan MIC Plan, and the Adjustment
Plan. Additionally, in 2000 and 2003, we granted 95,000 options and 35,000
options outside of these plans to corporate officers, which are included within
the information presented herein and contain similar provisions to our 1998
Plan. We account for stock options issued to employees under provisions of APB
25 and therefore, to the extent the fair value of the underlying stock is equal
to or less than the exercise price on the measurement date, no compensation
expense is recognized for employee stock option grants. 
If we
accounted for the costs relating to all option grants under the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, our net loss would have been $73 million, or $051 per pro forma
diluted share, in 2003, $152 million, or $116 per pro forma diluted share, in
2002 and $235 million, or $229 per pro forma diluted share, in 2001 see Note
2. 
Pro forma
compensation expense is recognized for the fair value of each option estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing model. The
following assumptions were used for option grants in 2003, 2002 and 2001:
expected volatility of 58%, 60% and 63%; risk-free interest rates of 27%, 38%
and 45%; expected terms of 65 years; and zero dividend yield. 
Under the
1998 NOE Plan, 1998 Plan, MIC Plan and option grants outside our stock option
plans, as of December 31, 2003, 3,092,800 total shares of common stock were
authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock options at prices
equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant. As of
December 31, 2003, 335,967 shares were available for grant under these stock
option plans. In most cases, stock options issued prior to October 22, 2002 are
exercisable at 25% each year over a four-year vesting period and have a
ten-year term from the grant date. In October 2002, our Board of Directors
approved a change in the vesting schedule for employee option grants made after
October 22, 2002 so that first-time grants issued to new employees vest 25%
after one year of employment and then monthly over the next three years, and
grants made to employees after their first year of employment vest monthly over
four years. However, provisions for 377,000 options granted in 1999 allowed for
potential early vesting to occur upon the achievement of certain financial
targets in 1999 and 2000. In 1999, these financial targets were met and, as a
result, 188,500 options vested effective February 2000. These targets were not
met in 2000 and therefore the unvested portion, 188,500 options, vest four
years from their date of grant. 
Under the
Director Plan, as of December 31, 2003, 110,000 shares of common stock were
authorized for issuance of stock options at prices equal to the fair market
value of our common shares at the date of grant. At December 31, 2003, there
were no shares available for grant under this Plan. Stock options are
exercisable and vest in full one year following their grant date provided the
optionee has continued to serve as our director. Each option expires on the
earlier of ten years from the grant date or 90 days following the termination
of a directors service as our director. 
49 We also
have an Adjustment Plan, which includes options granted in connection with the
dividend distribution occurring on April 6, 1998. As part of this distribution,
existing ATL option holders received one of our options for every six ATL
options held. There was no change to the intrinsic value of the option grant,
ratio of exercise price to market value, vesting provisions or option period as
a result of the distribution. As of December 31, 2003, 52,840 shares of common
stock were authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock options at
prices equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of
grant. 
Prior to
the Distribution Date, we had no stock option plans specifically identified as
our plans. All stock options granted through that date were part of ATL option
plans. 
Also as
part of the distribution, restricted shares totaling zero, zero, and 459, as
determined using the exchange ratio of one of our restricted shares for every
three ATL restricted shares, were outstanding as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001.
In 2003, we
granted 10,000 options to a non-employee and, in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123, calculated the fair value of the options using the
Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following assumptions for the year
ended December 31, 2003: expected volatility of 60%, risk-free interest rate of
42%, expected term of 10 years and zero dividend yield. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, we recorded stock-based compensation expense related to
these options of $42,000 in accordance with the accelerated methodology
described in FASB Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation
Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.

Stock purchase rights 
On April 6,
1998, we and First Chicago Trust Company of New York First Chicago entered
into a Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement was subsequently amended on
October 24, 2001 to reflect that EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. had succeeded
First Chicago as the rights agent. The Rights Agreement has certain
anti-takeover provisions, which will cause substantial dilution to a person or
group that attempts to acquire us.
Under the Rights Agreement, each of our shareholders has one share
purchase right for each share of common stock held, with each right having an
exercise price approximating our board of directors estimate of the long-term
value of one share of our common stock. The rights are triggered if an acquiror
acquires, or successfully makes a tender offer for, 20% or more of our
outstanding common stock. In such event, each shareholder other than the
acquiror would have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, a number of
newly issued shares of our capital stock at a 50% discount. If the acquiror
were to acquire 50% or more of our assets or earning power, each shareholder
would have the right to purchase, at the exercise 
50 price, a number of shares of acquirors stock at a 50% discount. Our
board of directors may redeem the rights at a nominal cost at any time before a
person acquires 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, which allows
board-approved transactions to proceed. In addition, our board of directors may
exchange all or part of the rights other than rights held by the acquiror for
such number of shares of our common stock equal in value to the exercise price.
Such an exchange produces the desired dilution without actually requiring our
shareholders to purchase shares.
Warrants 
In 1999, we
issued 15,000 warrants to non-employee consultants in connection with marketing
work performed. These warrants had exercise prices of $1144 and vested one
year from their date of grant. During 2000, all these warrants were exercised
through a cashless exercise, which resulted in the issuance of 8,877 shares of
common stock. As of December 31, 2003, no warrants were outstanding. 
9. Financing 
In May
2002, we sold 2,700,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1725 per share.
Net proceeds from this sale were $426 million. In August 2001, we sold
1,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $1500 per share to selected
institutional and other accredited investors. Net proceeds from this private
placement were $231 million. 
10. Income taxes
For income
tax purposes, our results through the Distribution Date were included in the
consolidated federal income tax return of ATL and, accordingly, the net
operating loss generated prior to the Distribution Date is not available to us
for use in periods subsequent to the Distribution Date. During the period from
the Distribution Date through December 31, 2003, we accumulated domestic net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $652 million, foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $89 million and research and experimentation
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $25 million. These carryforwards
begin expiring in 2018 and will be fully expired in 2023. Approximately $89
million of the domestic net operating loss carryforwards result from stock
option deductions which, when and if realized, would result in a credit to
shareholders equity. 
Because we
have incurred losses since inception, a valuation allowance entirely offsetting
deferred tax assets has been established, thereby eliminating any deferred tax
benefit. The increase in the valuation allowance of $02 million in 2003 21 million in 2002, and $69 million in 2001 is primarily the result of
increasing net operating loss carryforwards. Under certain provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the availability of our net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation if it
should be determined that there has been a change in ownership of more than
50%. Such determination could limit the utilization of net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards.

401k Retirement Savings Plan 
All our
employees in the United States are eligible to participate in our 401k Plan.
Terms of the 401k Plan permit an employee to contribute up to a maximum of
16% of an employees annual compensation on a post-tax or pre-tax basis, up to
the maximum permissible by the Internal Revenue Service IRS during any plan
year. We match each employees contribution in increments equivalent to 100%
for the first 3% and 50% for the second 3% of the employees contribution
percentage. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, we contributed $859,000, $802,000 and
$540,000 in matching contributions to the 401k Plan in accordance with the
plans terms. Employees immediately vest in the contributions the employee
makes. Vesting in our contribution on behalf of the employee occurs at equal
increments at the end of each year of the first five years of an employees
service with us. 
12. Commitments and contingencies 
Indemnification Obligations and Guarantees
We apply
the disclosure provisions of FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses. We
provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and
distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third
parties arising from the use of our products; ii indemnifications of varying
scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result
of defects in our products; iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to
consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide
to us; and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries
such as lease payments. These indemnifications and guarantees give rise only to
the disclosure provisions of FIN 45.
To date, we
have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not
expect to incur material costs in the future.
Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities in our financial statements related to these
indemnifications or guarantees.
Operating leases 
We
currently lease office and manufacturing space under operating leases. As of
December 31, 2003, future minimum lease payments are as follows in thousands

expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $14 million 11 million and $10 million. 
Capital lease obligations 
We entered
into certain long-term obligations to finance the purchase of capital equipment
as part of our normal business operations. Original terms of the obligations
range from 18 to 48 months and have imputed interest rates ranging between 10%
and 15%. Obligations are secured by underlying assets. The following is a
summary of the capital lease obligations and the related future minimum
payments as of December 31, 2003 in thousands:

Other commitments 
As part of
our agreements with our suppliers, suppliers may procure resources and material
expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our
production schedule provided to them. In the event these items are not used in
the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes
obsolete as a result of production 
52 timing, material changes or design changes, we may be responsible for
compensating our suppliers for these procurements. As of December 31, 2003,
these commitments were not significant. 
As part of
obtaining our lease for our current facility, we were required to deposit
approximately $350,000, representing restricted cash with our bank. Also, we
were required to maintain a deposit of approximately $310,000 with our bank in
the United Kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges. Both
amounts are included in other long-term assets. 
In the
United States, we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into
group purchasing agreements with major healthcare group purchasing
organizations, or GPOs. Typically, a GPO negotiates with medical suppliers,
such as us, on behalf of the GPOs member healthcare facilities, providing such
members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions. In exchange, the GPO
identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members. Member facilities participating
in the GPOs purchasing program can consist of hospitals, medical group
practices, nursing homes, surgery centers, managed care organizations, long
term care facilities, clinics and integrated delivery networks. Currently, we
have GPO supply agreements with AmeriNet, Inc., Novation, LLC, Premier, Inc.,
Broadlane, Inc. includes Kaiser Permanente, Tenet Healthcare and others and
Consorta, Inc. We recorded sales and marketing expenses related to these
agreements in the amounts of approximately $568,000 in 2003, $512,000 in 2002
and $236,000 in 2001. 
Contingencies 
We have
obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA to sell
and distribute our product domestically. However, we cannot assure you that the
FDA will approve future product submissions by us. Additionally, international
sales and distribution are dependent upon our obtaining approval of certain
foreign regulatory agencies. We have obtained approval from many of these
agencies; however, we cannot assure you that we will obtain approval from other
foreign regulatory agencies from which we seek approval in the future, on a
timely basis, or if at all. 
On
July 24, 2001, Neutrino Development Corporation filed a complaint against us in
U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging
infringement of U.S. Patent 6,221,021, or the 021 patent, by SonoSite as a
result of our use, sale and manufacture of the SonoSite 180, SonoSite 180 PLUS,
SonoHeart and SonoHeart PLUS devices. The complaint asserts claims for
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining all alleged acts of
infringement, compensatory and enhanced damages, attorneys fees and costs, and
pre- and post-judgment interest. On August 14, 2001, we filed an answer asserting
affirmative defenses of non-infringement and patent invalidity, and included a
counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity
regarding Neutrinos patent. On October 4, 2001, the court denied a request by
Neutrino for preliminary injunctive relief to prevent us from manufacturing and
selling our products pending the ultimate disposition of the litigation. On
February 20, 2002, in what is known as a Markman hearing, the parties
presented their arguments regarding the proper construction of Neutrinos
patent claims. 
On August
20, 2003, the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas issued a
decision interpreting certain terms used in the 021 patent. This decision does
not discuss whether the patent is valid or whether the patent would apply to
any of our products. In the order, the court, in resolving disputed terms in
the Markman hearing, adopted our construction of the term a portable body
designed to be hand held, and adopted Neutrinos construction of the terms
the moveably connected transducer mounting assembly and ultrasound emitter.
The court denied our motion for summary judgment. We subsequently filed a new summary judgment motion using the
courts construction of the claim language that the 021 patent is invalid
based on prior art. Neutrino has filed a summary judgment motion based on its
allegations of infringement. 
We
also have asked the Texas court to stay proceedings in Neutrinos suit filed in
the Middle District of Florida on August 19, 2003 against a former SonoSite
distributor alleging that the sale of our products by such distributor
infringes the 021 patent, and to enjoin Neutrino from filing similar suits
against other sellers of SonoSite products. Neutrino had previously filed such
a suit in the Middle District of Tennessee against another medical device
distributor for selling a SonoSite product. That Tennessee case has been
dismissed based on a final judgment and permanent injunction filed a month
after the case was filed. The Tennessee judgment has no effect on the Texas
proceedings. In the Florida action, we have filed a motion to stay the
proceedings in the Florida court pending a final resolution of the patent suit
in Texas. We have also filed a motion to strike certain counts of Neutrinos
complaint.
We
believe that we have good and sufficient defenses to the claims of patent
infringement asserted against us by Neutrino and we are vigorously defending
ourselves in these matters. If we are not successful in our defense of these
claims, we could be forced to modify or discontinue selling our products or may
enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms
acceptable to us, if at all, and which could adversely affect our financial 
53 condition, results of operations and cash flow.
Sales of the allegedly infringing products represented the majority of our
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001.
We do not
consider a negative litigation outcome to be probable and have not accrued any
amounts for potential losses related to these proceedings. Because of
uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending
litigation, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability
that could result from an unfavorable outcome. As additional information
becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to its
pending litigation. We will record accruals for losses if and when we determine
the negative outcome of such matters to be probable and reasonably estimable.
Our estimates regarding such losses could differ from actual results. Revisions
in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results
of operations, financial position and cash flow.
13. Segment reporting 
We
currently have one reporting segment. We market our products in the United
States and internationally through our direct sales force and our indirect
distribution channels. Our chief operating decision maker evaluates resource allocation
decisions and our performance based upon revenue recorded in geographic regions
and does not receive financial information about expense allocation on a
disaggregated basis. Geographic regions are determined by the shipping
destination. Revenue by geographic location for the years ended December 31 is

Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures 
The term
disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15e and
15d-15e of the Exchange Act. These rules refer to the controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required
time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive officer and our chief financial officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Our chief
executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31,
2003, and they have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. 
Changes in internal controls 
There were
no significant changes in SonoSites internal controls over financial reporting
or, to SonoSites knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect
SonoSites disclosure controls and procedures during the quarter ended December
31, 2003.
