REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Larscom Incorporated
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Larscom Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1999 and
1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above. s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1--THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Larscom Incorporated the Company, a majority owned subsidiary of Axel
Johnson Inc. Axel Johnson, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range
of high speed, internetworking products for network service providers, Internet
services providers and corporate users. The Company operates in one industry
segment.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and
account balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company investment
in a less than 50% owned entity was accounted for using the equity method.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION
Financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk, consist primarily of investments in certain debt securities and accounts
receivable. The Company primarily invests its excess cash in commercial paper
rated A1/P1, bank certificates of deposit rated AA or better and corporate
medium-term notes rated AA or better. The Company is exposed to credit risks in
the event of default by the financial institutions or issuers of investments to
the extent recorded on the balance sheet. The Company accounts receivable are
derived from sales to customers primarily in the United States. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, and generally requires no
collateral from its customers. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses, and to date has not experienced any material losses. Receivables
from two customers represented 28% and 37% of accounts receivable at December
31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. During 1999, one of the Company significant
customers AT acquired the data network business of another significant
customer IBM. Both 1999 and 1998 percentages of total receivables have been
restated as if the merger had been in effect for all periods presented.
The following table summarizes the percentage of total revenues for
customers accounting for more than 10% of the Company revenues                                YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

calculations have been restated for 1998 and 1997, as if the merger had been
in effect in those years.  In May 1999, AT purchased the IBM Global Network from IBM. Percent of
total revenue calculations have been restated for 1999, 1998, 1997, as if
the acquisition had been in effect in those years.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
33
LARSCOM INCORPORATED
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1--THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
CONTINUED
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and highly liquid investments
with original maturities of ninety days or less. The carrying amount of cash and
cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of
those investments and the financial stability of the issuers.
The Company participates in Axel Johnson centralized cash management
system. In general, all of the Company cash receipt and disbursement
transactions are processed through the Axel Johnson centralized cash management
system.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company accounts for its short-term investments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, the Company determines
the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and equity securities
at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance
sheet date. All of the securities owned by the Company at December 31, 1999 and
1998 consisted of fixed and variable rate commercial paper rated A1/P1, bank
certificates of deposit rated AA or better and corporate medium-term notes rated
AA or better. These securities have contractual maturity dates of less than one
year and have been classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of the
Company short-term investments approximate their carrying value due to the
short maturity of those investments. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market. Standard
cost approximates actual average cost.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or
the lease term of the respective assets.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill resulting from the NetEdge acquisition is amortized over its
estimated useful life. At each balance sheet date, an evaluation is performed by
management to ascertain whether intangible assets have been impaired by
comparing carrying value with the estimated future non-discounted cash flows and
the Company records impairment of the carrying value, if any, based on the
estimated future value of the discounted cash flows.

NOTE 1--THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
CONTINUED
WARRANTY
The Company provides a three-year warranty for most of its products. A
provision for the estimated cost of warranty, which includes material, labor and
overhead, is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. While the Company
believes that its reserves for estimated future warranty costs are adequate,
there are inherent risks associated with these estimates, particularly for those
estimates related to products that have been recently introduced.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment of the
product. The Company does not recognize revenue to distributors when a right of
return exists until the Company is notified by the distributor that the products
have been shipped to the end user. Service revenue is recognized over the
contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Software development costs incurred prior to establishment of technological
feasibility are expensed as research and development costs. Costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, and prior to the
general release of the product to the public, were not significant for all
periods presented and accordingly have been expensed.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts. A valuation
allowance is provided against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not
it will not be realized.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants
and convertible securities. Basic earnings per share is computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and
common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent
shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.

their effect would have been antidilutive. These stock options could be dilutive
in the future. See Note 6 for details of options issued.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, the Company is
continuing to measure compensation costs for stock-based compensation plans
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. The pro forma disclosures of the difference
between compensation cost included in net income and the related cost measured
by the fair value method, as required by SFAS 123, are presented in Note 6.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
For all financial instruments, including short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, the
carrying value is considered to approximate fair value due to the relatively
short- term maturities of the respective instruments.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133 
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The new standard
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or
liabilities, measured at fair value. Under SFAS No. 133, gains or losses
resulting from changes in the value of the derivatives are to be reported in the
statement of operations or as a deferred item, depending on the use of the
derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting. The Company is
required to adopt SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001. To date, the
Company has not engaged in any hedging activity and does not expect adoption of
this new standard to have a significant impact on the Company.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition which provides
guidence on recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be
met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue
recognition policies. The Company does not expect SAB 101 to have a material
effect on its financial position or results of operations.

proportionate cost of these programs based on historical experience and relative
headcount. The costs reimbursed to Axel Johnson include costs for reported
claims, as well as changes in reserves for incurred but not reported claims. The
Company recorded expenses related to the reimbursement of these costs of
approximately $845,000, $828,000 and $488,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The Company believes the allocation by Axel Johnson of the
proportionate cost is reasonable but is not necessarily indicative of the costs
that would have been incurred had the Company maintained its own benefit plans.
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
Axel Johnson provides certain functional services to the Company, including
certain treasury, accounting, tax, internal audit, legal and human resources.
The costs of these services have been allocated to the Company based on
estimates of actual costs incurred. Management believes that such allocations
are reasonable. Such charges and allocations are not necessarily indicative of
the costs that
38

NOTE 3--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: CONTINUED
would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate entity. The
allocated costs of these services amounting to $438,000, $425,000 and $622,000
in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, has been included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
CREDIT AGREEMENT
The Company and Axel Johnson entered into a credit agreement, pursuant to
which Axel Johnson has agreed to provide a revolving credit/working capital
facility the Credit Agreement to the Company in an aggregate amount of
$15,000,000. The Credit Agreement expires in December 2000. Any loans under the
Credit Agreement bear interest during each calendar quarter at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the three month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR, plus
20%, initially on the date when the loan is made and adjusted thereafter on the
first business day of each calendar quarter. Additionally, the Company is
required to pay a commitment fee of 05% per annum on the unused portion of the
Credit Agreement. The Company is in compliance with certain covenants under the
Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 1999, $15,000,000 was available, and during
1999 and 1998, no borrowings were made under the Credit Agreement.
LARVAN LEASE
Prior to September 1997, the Company leased its principal facility from
Larvan Properties Larvan, a general partnership in which the Company owned a
one-third interest. The Company paid $278,000 in rent expense to Larvan and
earned partnership income of $21,000 in 1997. In September 1997, the Company
moved to a new facility that is leased from a third party. The Company recorded,
as other income in accordance with the equity method, a pre-tax gain of
$1,329,000 in March 1998 from the sale of its former headquarters by Larvan.
NOTE 4--CAPITAL STOCK   The rights, preferences and privileges of each class of Common Stock are

A Common Stock on a share-for-share basis, subject to adjustment for dividends,
stock splits, subdivisions or combinations.
The Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000
undesignated shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix the
rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend
rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation

7,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $12 per share of which
5,800,000 were sold by the Company and 1,200,000 shares were sold by Axel
Johnson. The Company received net proceeds of $63,279,000 in December 1996. In
January 1997, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option and sold an
additional 1,050,000 shares of which 350,000 were sold by the Company and
700,000 were sold by Axel Johnson. Net proceeds to the Company in January 1997

NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES: CONTINUED
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109
SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has not recorded any
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets because management has
determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be
realized. Realization of these assets is primarily dependent on the ability of
the Company to generate taxable income in the future. Some of the factors that
the Company used to make this determination are: the Company recently improved
operating results; a significant portion of the deferred tax assets is
deductible over fifteen years; tax losses can be carried forward for twenty
years; a portion of the losses can be carried back to prior years. The amount of
the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term
if the Company estimates of future taxable income are reduced. This could
result in a charge to net income.
NOTE 6--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS THRIFT PLAN
The Company participates in the Axel Johnson Thrift Plan the Thrift Plan
qualified under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Heretofore, the
Thrift Plan allowed employees to defer up to 21% of their compensation not to
exceed the amount allowed by the applicable Internal Revenue Service guidelines.
The Company matched 60% of employee contributions made on a pre-tax basis and
30% of employee contributions made on an after-tax basis, subject to a maximum
of 6% of total eligible employee compensation in 1999. Company contributions
vest ratably over five years of service or two years of plan participation,
whichever occurs first. Contributions by the Company under the Thrift Plan
amounted to $529,000, $640,000 and $503,000 in 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
PENSION PLAN
Effective March 31, 1998, the Company employees ceased to accrue benefits
under the Axel Johnson sponsored defined benefit pension plan, the Axel
Johnson Inc. Retirement Plan. Accrued liabilities prior to March 31, 1998 will
remain in the Axel Johnson pension plan until benefits are paid to employees
upon termination or retirement in a manner prescribed by the plan. After March
1998, Company employees also ceased to accrue benefits under Axel Johnson
unfunded pension plan, the Axel Johnson Inc. Retirement Restoration Plan, for
employees whose benefits under the defined pension plan are reduced due to
limitations under federal tax laws.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan,
for which 685,000 shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved for issuance. The
Board of Directors approved an additional 100,000 shares allotment for the plan
in 2000 subject to stockholder approval. The Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees to purchase Class A Common Stock at the beginning or at the end of
each six-month offering period subject to various limitations. The offering
periods commence each February and August. Eligible employees may designate not
more than 10% of their cash compensation to be deducted each pay period for the
purchase of common stock under the Purchase Plan, and participants may purchase
not more than $25,000 of common stock in any one calendar year, or 1,000 shares
in each offering period. A total of 100,000, 129,000 and 62,000 shares of
Class A Common Stock were issued under the Purchase Plan in 1999, 1998, and
1997, respectively.

STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
In 1996, the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
the Directors' Plan and reserved a total of 205,000 shares of the Company
Class A Common Stock for issuance thereunder. The Board of Directors approved an
additional 100,000 shares allotment for the plan in 2000 subject to stockholder
approval. The Directors' Plan provides for the grant of stock options pursuant
to an automatic grant mechanism to members of the Board of Directors who are not
employees of the Company or of Axel Johnson. Each non-employee director will
receive an initial grant, upon first becoming a director, to purchase a total of
18,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, and each year thereafter will receive an
option to purchase a total of 6,000 shares of Class A Common Stock. Each option
is granted at an exercise price equal to fair market value on date of grant.
Each initial grant vests in three equal annual occurrences and each annual grant
vests in full in the third year following the date of grant. Options expire one
year after termination of Board Service or ten years after the date of grant.
STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
The Company adopted a Stock Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan for which
3,985,000 shares of Class A Common Stock have been reserved for issuance
thereunder. The Board of Directors approved an additional 2,800,000 shares
allotment for the plan in 2000 subject to stockholder approval. The Incentive
Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to employees and
eligible consultants. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors the Administrator. The maximum term of
an option granted under the Incentive Plan may not exceed ten years from the
date of grant five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a
10% stockholder. Options generally vest over a four-year period from the date
of grant.

NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   In April 1998, the Company received notification from the General Services
Administration GSA that it had completed its audit of the Company two
product supply contracts that were subject to GSA regulations. At December 31,
1997, the Company had a reserve of $532,000 to cover potential pricing
deficiencies, associated audit and legal costs and penalties under these
contracts. As a result of the notification by GSA, the Company released the
reserve of $532,000 in the second quarter of 1998, which resulted in a reduction
in selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year. The Company
believes that no additional liabilities will result from this matter.
At the end of 1998, vendors of three integrated circuits ICs notified
the Company regarding their intent to cease production. As a result of
anticipated continued usage of these ICs, the Company
45

NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: CONTINUED
entered into purchase commitments of approximately $1,250,000 in aggregate,
representing between one and two years expected demand for these components. As
of December 31, 1999, the Company is obligated to purchase $661,000 of these ICs
by 2001.
In its distribution agreements, the Company typically agrees to indemnify
its customers for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed
infringements of patents, trademarks or copyrights of third parties.
NOTE 9--ACQUISITION   On December 31, 1997, the Company completed a triangular merger with NetEdge
Systems Inc. NetEdge. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and,
on this basis, the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the
tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been allocated to various
intangible assets, primarily consisting of in-process research and development,
current technology, trademarks and goodwill based on an independent third-party
valuation. At that time, the Company estimated that the useful economic lives of
the current technology, trademarks and goodwill were five, seven and six years,
respectively. The Company determined that no alternative future use existed for
the in-process research and development and therefore recorded a charge to
earnings of $20,120,000 in 1997.
Research and development projects underway at the date of the acquisition of
NetEdge were classified into two different categories--enhancements to the
existing EDGE hardware platform and development of a new hardware platform. The
values of the in-process research and development were determined based on the
expected net discounted cash flows to be generated from the products under
development at the date of acquisition. A discount rate of 35% was used to
calculate discounted future cash flows, which reflects the inherent risks of the
research and development efforts. The values attributed to the enhancements to
the existing EDGE hardware platform and the development of a new hardware
platform were $6,070,000 and $14,050,000, respectively, as of December 31, 1997.
The most sensitive factor in determining the expected net discounted cash flows
from these projects was revenues.
Of the total purchase consideration, $6,300,000 was placed into escrow
pending resolution of certain matters including purchase price adjustments and
other representations and warranties. In 1999, $2,147,000 was released to the
shareholders of NetEdge. In 1998, $600,000 of the escrow amount was released to
the Company and $400,000 was released to the shareholders of NetEdge. There
remained $3,589,000 in escrow, representing principal and accrued interest on
December 31, 1999, which is expected to be released by December 31, 2000.

As a result of the review and refocus of the Company business in October
1998, the Company reviewed the intangible assets associated with the NetEdge
acquisition for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121. The review and refocus was
precipitated by successively lower quarterly revenues during the year for the
Company as a whole and by worse than anticipated revenues from the NetEdge
product family. The Company determined that the sum of the estimated future cash
flows related to the EDGE products were less than the carrying amount of the
purchased intangible assets. The fair value of these intangible assets was
determined by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows of
those assets. As a result of this review, the Company recognized an impairment
loss of $7,915,000 in 1998, principally related to the current technology.
As a result of adjustments to the purchase price made in 1998, goodwill,
which was originally recorded at $1,493,000, was adjusted down to $1,145,000. In
addition, goodwill was further written down in 1998 to $854,000 as a result of
the impairment analysis and is amortized over its revised estimated useful
economic life of three years. At December 31, 1999, the net book value of the
goodwill was $448,000.
NOTE 10--RESTRUCTURING   In October 1998, the Company announced a corporate restructuring designed to
better align its expenses with anticipated revenues and to tighten its focus on
opportunities that offer the best long-term growth potential. The restructuring
included a work force reduction of approximately 16%. The restructuring charge
included $876,000 of employee severance, $89,000 of asset write-downs and
$249,000 of other expenses. As of December 31, 1998, $541,000 remained accrued
which was paid in 1999.
