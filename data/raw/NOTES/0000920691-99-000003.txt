See notes to consolidated financial statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  December 31, 1998 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business and Company Organization 
Tripos, Inc. delivers science, tools and analysis services that advance 
customers' creativity and productivity  in  pharmaceutical, agrochemical,
biotechnology and related research  industries worldwide. The Company is 
also a value-added reseller of thirdparty  hardware products required to
operate its software products.  A substantial portion of the Company 
business is conducted with pharmaceutical companies, however, the Company 
is not economically dependent on any customer on an ongoing basis.
Effective June 1, 1994, Evans and Sutherland Computer Company E, 
the former parent of the Company, distributed all outstanding shares
of the common stock of the Company formerly Tripos Associates, Inc. to 
E shareholders the Distribution such that every three shares of E
yielded one share of the Company.  Shortly before the Distribution, the 
Company changed its name to Tripos, Inc.
Basis of Consolidation  
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant 
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in affiliates, owned more than 20%, but not in excess of 50 are recorded on the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated 
affiliates less than 20% owned are accounted for under the cost method.
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when 
purchased are considered to be cash equivalents. 
Investments 
The Company investments, which consist primarily of U.S. government and 
other high-quality debt securities with maturities of less than five years,
have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
There were no unrealized holding gains and losses since the fair value 
approximated the amortized cost of investments at each year-end. 
Inventory 
Inventory consists of finished chemical compounds, supplies and work in 
process at its U.K. subsidiary, Tripos Receptor Research Ltd., and is 
carried at the lower of cost standard cost method approximating FIFO or
market.
Notes Receivable-Trade  
Amounts shown for notes receivable-trade represent customer receivables with
maturities in excess of one year net of imputed interest discount.
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by
applying an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 
which range from five to ten years for equipment and furniture, twenty-
five to thirty-nine years for buildings, the shorter of the useful life
of the improvement or the life of the related lease for leasehold improvements,
and three years for purchased software.
Development Costs  
Development costs consist of software development costs which are 
capitalized after the establishment of technological feasibility in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86. 
For 1997 and 1996, costs associated with the design and creation of
diverse compound libraries, within the Company Accelerated Discovery 
Services relationship with MDS Panlabs, were capitalized. Amortization of
capitalized software development costs is provided on a productby-product 
basis as the greater of a the ratio of current gross revenues for a product
to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues or b the 
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the 
product. Currently, the Company is using an estimated economic life of 
three to five years. Capitalized costs associated with the diverse
compound libraries were amortized on a two-year straight-line method up 
until the time of the restructuring of the Agreement with MDS Panlabs,
at which time all remaining costs were written off to cost of sales. 
Beginning in 1998, library design and production costs associated with the
LeadQuest compound library  are accounted for under the inventory method 
of accounting.
The Company assesses the recoverability of capitalized development costs by 
comparing the remaining unamortized balance to the net realizable value of
the related product. Any excess is written off. All other research and 
development expenditures are charged to research and development expense 
in the period incurred.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted AICPA Statement of Position
98-1 SOP 98-1 which requires capitalization of certain costs incurred 
in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software. Capitalized
costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the remaining 
useful life of the software.
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the net assets acquired of 
Tripos Receptor Research Ltd. over its fair value. It is being amortized 
on a straight-line basis over 15 years.  On a periodic basis, the Company 
evaluates goodwill for impairment by comparing estimated future discounted
cash flows of the business to which the goodwill relates to its carrying value.
Revenue Recognition  
In late 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA 
issued statement of Position 972 SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
and updated it in early 1998 with SOP 98-4. These SOPs became effective 
for the Company for transactions entered into after January 1, 1998. The 
Company recognizes revenue from software licenses in accordance with these 
SOPs upon product delivery, customer acceptance with all obligations fulfilled
at the date of delivery, and determination that collectibility of the sale
proceeds  is probable.  The Company recognizes revenue from software support 
contracts ratably over the term of the contract, typically one to three years.
In software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products, 
specified upgrades, software support services and/or other services, the 
Company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on 
the relative fair value of each of the deliverables determined based on 
vendor specific objective evidence. Revenue from chemical compound sales is
recognized upon delivery of the product. Hardware sales are recognized on
delivery of the product from the Company vendor to the Company customer.
The Company has entered into contract research agreements and software 
consulting arrangements with certain customers which provide for
collaboration with the Company in defining related software products, 
early access to the products, discounts on licenses for the products 
developed and compound library design. The Company recognizes revenue 
related to contract research and software consulting agreements as 
contractual milestones are achieved and delivered or, absent such contractual
milestones, on a completed contract basis or a percentage of completion basis.
Warranty  
The Company is a reseller of hardware and passes through to its customers 
the standard warranties provided by the hardware supplier. The Company 
warrants its application software products to perform in accordance with 
written user documentation and the agreements negotiated with the customer.
Since the Company does not customize its applications software, software 
warranty costs are insignificant and expensed as incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation  
The local foreign currency is the functional currency for the Company 
foreign operations. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are 
translated to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the 
applicable balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the 
average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting 
from translation are reported as a separate component of shareholders' 
equity. Net gains and losses from foreign currency transactions were not
significant during any of the years presented.
Comprehensive Income 
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income which became effective for the Company 
for 1998.  SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components revenue, gains and losses in a 
full set of general purpose financial statements. SFAS 130 requires that 
all components of comprehensive income, including net income, be 
reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence
as other financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change
in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances
from non-owner sources.  Net income and other comprehensive income, including
foreign  currency  translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses 
on investments, shall be reported, net of their related tax effect, to
arrive at comprehensive income.  The adoption of SFAS 130 has not had an 
impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.
Income Taxes  
The provision for income taxes is computed using the liability method. 
The primary difference between financial statement and taxable income 
results from the use of different methods of computing depreciation, 
capitalized development costs, accrued vacation and customer deposits.
Earnings Per Common and Dilutive Share 
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 128 
FAS 128, Earnings per Share.  FAS 128 replaced the calculation 
of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted 
earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.  
Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares and potential dilutive common shares that 
were outstanding during the  period.  Potential dilutive common shares
consist of outstanding  stock  options.  See Note 14 for additional 
information regarding earnings per share.
Stock-based Compensation  
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123, Accounting For 
Stock-Based Compensation, effective for years beginning after December 1995.
However, the Company has elected to continue following Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based transactions.
Under APB 25, generally no compensation expense is recognized because the
exercise price of the options equal the fair value of the stock at the 
grant date. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 
123 as shown in Note 6 to these financial statements.
Accounting Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
FAS 133, which is required to be adopted in years beginning after June 
15, 1999. FAS 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal
quarter after its issuance. The Company expects to adopt the new Statement
effective January 1, 2000. FAS 133 will require the Company to recognize 
all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company has not yet
determined what the effect FAS 133 will be on the earnings and financial 
position of the Company.
Reclassifications

Income tax payments for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $361,500, $1,010,000 
and $262,000, respectively.
Three of the Company foreign  subsidiaries had  loss carryforwards  
at December 31, 1998, totaling approximately $1,104,000 that have no
expiration date. Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the 
United States are considered to be permanently invested. Accordingly, no 
provision for U.S. income taxes was made for undistributed earnings of 
such subsidiaries, which aggregated $426,000 at December 31, 1998. 5. Stock Plans
In 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 
which allows eligible employees to purchase stock at the lower of 85% 
of the fair market value of the stock on the enrollment date
or exercise date as defined by the plan. Pursuant to the plan, 
employee purchases are limited to 10% of compensation. The plan, which 
was amended in 1998 to raise the number of shares reserved for
issuance from 150,000 to 350,000 shares, is in effect for ten years unless 
terminated or amended sooner by the Board of Directors. At 
December 31, 1998, 149,661 shares have been purchased under this plan.
In 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Stock Plan which is administered
by the Compensation Committee and provides for incentive stock options,
nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to be granted to 
employees and consultants of the Company.  Pursuant to the plan, incentive 
stock options can be exercised at a price which is not less than the fair 
value of the stock on the grant date, and nonstatutory stock options and 
stock purchase rights can be exercised at a price which is determined by
the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for
establishing the period over which options and rights can be exercised.
Options vest at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of each grant and 
1/48th per month over the next three years. All options granted have 10-
year terms. The plan, which was amended in 1998 to increase the number
of shares of  common stock reserved for issuance from 1,100,000
to 1,280,000, is in effect for ten years unless terminated or amended 
sooner by the Board of Directors.
In 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Director Option
Plan which provides for nonstatutory stock options to
be granted to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the
stock at the date of grant. Options can be
exercised in 25% increments on the anniversary of
its date of grant. The plan, which was amended in
1998 to decrease the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance from 300,000 to 240,000, is in
effect for ten years unless terminated or amended
sooner by the Board of Directors.
The Company has elected to follow APB 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations in accounting for its
employee and director stock options because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under SFAS 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of
option valuation models that were not developed for
use in valuing employee stock options. Under
APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company employee and director stock options
equals the market price of the underlying stock on
the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized. 
Pro forma information regarding net income and
earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has
been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee and director stock options under the
fair value method of that Statement. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date
of grant using a BlackScholes option pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-
free interest rates ranging from 513% to 664%
for 1996, 545% to 650% for 1997 and 426% to
565% for 1998; volatility factor of 85 for 1996,
86 for 1997 and 94 for 1998; and a weighted
average expected life of the option of 53 years for
both 1996 and 1997 and 42 years for 1998. For the
Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
compensation expense was also estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following assumptions: risk-free interest rates
ranging from 505% to 525% for 1996, 57%
to 64% for 1997 and 536% to 565%
for 1998; volatility factors of 85 for 1996, 86
for 1997 and 94 for 1998; and a weighted average
expected life of the option of 6 months.  For all
years presented, the Company used a dividend rate
of zero.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of
traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation  models  require the input of highly
subjective assumptions  including the expected
stock price volatility. Because the Company
employee and director stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect
the fair value estimate, in management opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide
a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
employee and director stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the options' vesting period. The Company pro

authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right a right for each share of
common stock outstanding on January 26, 1996.
Each right represents the right to purchase one
preferred share of stock. These rights can be
exercised only if certain events occur, which
include, among other things, when a beneficial owner
of the Company common stock acquires a total of
20% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company. 6. Benefit Plan
In 1994, the Company established a defined
contribution 401k Plan covering all domestic
employees who are at least 21 years of age and have
completed at least six months of service provided that
such service represents a minimum of 1,000 hours
worked. Employees may contribute to the plan up
to 17% of their compensation, which is further
limited by law $9,700 in 1998. The Company will
match employee contributions for an amount up to 50%
of the first 6% of each employee compensation
deferral. Contributions made by the Company were
$177,600 in 1998 and $180,500 in 1997. 7.  Geographic Segment Data
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS 131, Segment Information which
became effective for the Company for 1998. SFAS 131
amends the requirements for public companies to
report financial and descriptive information about its
reportable operating segments in annual financial
statements and selected information about operating
segments in interim reports issued to shareholders.
It also establishes standards for related disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas, and
major customers. Operating segments, as defined in
SFAS 131, are components of the enterprise for which
separate financial information is available and is
evaluated regularly by the Company in deciding how
to allocate resources and assess performance. The
Company believes it operates in one reportable
business operating segment and therefore presents
only the following geographic data as representative
segment information.
The Company foreign operations historically have been
conducted principally  through  the Company wholly 
owned foreign subsidiaries and distributors. Information regarding
operations by geographic area for 1998, 1997 and 1996 is as follows        U.S.A.   U.K.   Germany  France  Pacific Rim   Total

integrated worldwide basis. Because of the integration of
U.S. and non-U.S. services, it is not practical to
separate precisely the U.S.oriented services from
services resulting from operations outside the United States and 
performed for customers outside the United States; accordingly, the
separation set forth in the preceding table is based upon internal 
allocations, which involve certain management judgments.
Net sales and long-lived assets in the preceding
table are attributable to the country or territory
in which the Company subsidiaries or distributors
are located. 8. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk have
consisted principally of investments and trade
receivables. The Company invests available cash in
bank deposits, investment-grade securities, and
shortterm  interest-producing  investments,
including  government obligations and other money
market instruments. The Company has adopted credit
policies and standards to evaluate the risk
associated with its sales and requires
collateral, such as letters of credit and bank
guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. Management
believes that any risk of loss is significantly
reduced due to the nature of the customers and
distributors with which it does business. 9. Lease Obligations
The Company leases certain office facilities and
equipment under noncancelable operating and capital
leases with terms from one to five years.  The
capital leases specifically pertain to the
acquisition of certain laboratory equipment
totaling $442,046. Rent expense under such
arrangements was $406,100, $757,712, and $629,505
in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.

The Company maintains a physical inventory of
chemical compound libraries in various states of
completion.  Costs associated with the
manufacture of compounds are calculated using
the standard cost method and are carried at the
lower of cost or market. Compounds that are acquired from 
third parties are also carried at the lower of 
cost or market. Finished Goods inventory may periodically 
contain costs of computer hardware that has been acquired 
for resale to the Company customers.                   December 31,  December 31,

12. Long-term Debt
The Company entered into a five-year $12,000,000 Credit
Agreement with a bank on October 16, 1998. The Credit Agreement
requires the Company to meet certain financial
covenants, including various coverage ratios and a
debt to capitalization ratio.  The line of credit
is secured by all of the Company U.S. assets as
well as a pledge of its European assets. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company was in violation of
one covenant which was subsequently waived by the
bank for that quarterly reporting period.
Interest on borrowings is payable under several
rate options. Additionally, the Company is required
to pay a nominal commitment fee for the unused
portion of the facility.  As of December 31,
1998, $2,100,000 of borrowings were outstanding.
Average borrowings under the facility for 1998
were $1,153,000 from the date of the first draw
until December 31, 1998. The weighted-average
interest rate incurred from the date of inception
until December 31, 1998 was 702%.
On November 14, 1997, the Company acquired its
headquarters building and grounds.  Financing for
the acquisition  was obtained from the same bank
that provides the current line of credit in the
amount of $3,560,000. The five-year mortgage note
amortizes the loan principal on a straight-line
basis on a twenty-year schedule. The variable
interest rate on the note is equivalent to the
thirty-day LIBOR rate plus 175%. The note
requires  the Company to meet certain financial
covenants consistent with those of the Credit
Agreement above.  The property  acquired  acts
as security for  the  borrowing. Concurrent with
the issuance of the mortgage note, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement with
the bank. This agreement effectively changed the
Company floating rate exposure to a fixed rate
of 826%. The interest rate swap agreement
matures at the same time as the mortgage note and
is for the same notional amount. The Company is
exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparty. However, the
Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the
counterparty bank. At December 31, 1998 the thirty-
day LIBOR rate plus 175% equaled 738%. Interest
paid during the periods was $292,500 in 1998 and
$21,300 in 1997.
On March 22, 1999, the Company received a credit
commitment with a bank, that will refinance the
existing $12 million Credit Agreement and the
mortgage note. The credit commitment is for a total
of $15,332,667 which is broken into three separate
credit facilities:  a  $3,332,667 secured real
estate mortgage, $4,000,000 three-year secured term 
loan, and an $8,000,000 threeyear revolving line of credit.
The credit commitment is collateralized by substantially 
all of the Company U.S. assets and stock pledges for 
the Company U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. The commitment 
also requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants,
including various coverage ratios and a debt to
capitalization ratio. These covenants within the
credit commitment are less stringent than those
contained in the current Credit Agreement. The Company 
expects to meet these new covenant requirements during 1999.
The mortgage note under the credit commitment calls
for even quarterly principal payments based on a
twenty-year amortization schedule beginning June 30,
1999. Borrowings under the mortgage will be subject
to a variable interest rate at LIBOR plus 225%.
The new bank has agreed to assume the underlying
swap agreement which was issued associated with the
previous mortgage note. The term note under the
credit commitment will require quarterly principal
payments of $250,000 plus interest beginning March
31, 2000.  The revolving line of credit under the
credit commitment will require quarterly interest-
only payments with any remaining borrowings due at
the end of the three-year commitment period.
Availability under the revolving line of credit will
be based on eligible U.S. accounts receivable.
Borrowings under the term loan will bear interest 
at variable rates tied to LIBOR while the revolving 
line of credit will bear interest at comparable LIBOR 
rates or at the bank prime rate.
