REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Modem Media, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Modem Media, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 5 of the consolidated financial statements the Company adopted the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets effective January 1, 2002.
As discussed in Note 2, the Company has restated
its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2001 and for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, previously audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Stamford, Connecticut March 4, 2003

MODEM MEDIA,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE
1.Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of OperationsModem Media, Inc. the Company is an interactive marketing strategy and services firm. The
Company is a marketing partner to many of the worlds leading companies and uses digital marketing and technologies to help their other clients realize greater value from their most vital assettheir customers. The Company leverages its
experience in marketing and business strategy, database marketing, creative design and technology development to address the unique business objectives, challenges and opportunities of each of its client companies. Headquartered in Norwalk,
Connecticut, the Company maintains offices in San Francisco, London and So Paulo. Discontinued OperationsIn the third quarter of 2002, the operations of the Companys offices in Toronto, Munich, Germany and Hong Kong ceased. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, as adopted by the Company on January 1, 2002, the results of these operations have been reclassified and are separately
presented for all reporting periods as discontinued operations. Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Use of EstimatesThe
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. ReclassificationsCertain reclassifications have
been made in the prior period consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. Revenue Recognition and BillingThe Company recognizes revenues as services are rendered in accordance with SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB No. 101. A majority of its revenues are derived from fixed-bid and retainer-based assignments. Unbilled revenues represent labor costs incurred and
estimated earnings in excess of billings and production and other client-reimbursable out-of-pocket costs incurred in excess of billings. Amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as deferred revenues. The
Companys clients hire it on a fixed-bid, retainer or time-and-materials basis. The Company reassesses its estimated costs on fixed-bid engagements periodically and, as needed for specific engagements. Losses are accrued to the extent that
costs incurred and anticipated costs to complete engagements exceed total anticipated billings. Provisions for losses on uncompleted fixed-bid contracts, if any, are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-Of-Pocket Expenses Incurred EITF 01-14. In
accordance with E1TF 01-14 the Company must report reimbursable pass-through expenses as a component of revenues and cost of revenues. Its adoption of EITF 01-14 results in increased revenues and increased cost of revenues. The Company had revenues
and related cost of revenues attributable to such expenses of $42 million, $30 million and $59 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.
Business CombinationsBusiness
combinations that have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting include the results of operations of the acquired businesses from the dates of their respective 
34 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued acquisition. Net assets of acquired companies are recorded at their fair value to the Company at the date of acquisition unless any such
company was acquired in a transaction between entities under common control in which case the assets of such company are recorded at historical cost. Business Concentrations and Credit RiskThe Companys services have been provided primarily to a limited number of
clients located worldwide in a variety of industries. The Company had revenues from three clients representing 187%, 169% and 114% of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company had revenues from two clients representing 233%
and 100% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001. No clients accounted for 100% or greater of the Companys revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company generally does not require its clients to provide collateral.
Additionally, the Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk with respect to its accounts receivable. The Company had three clients accounting for 376%, 176% and 138% of total gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2002. The
Company had four clients accounting for 276%, 197%, 136% and 109% of total gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2001. Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. In accordance with such standard, the provision for income taxes includes deferred income taxes resulting from items reported in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities represent the expected future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred income
tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company follows the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123 encourages, but does not require,
companies to record compensation expense for stock-based employee compensation plans at fair value. The Company has elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method presented in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee and related interpretations. Accordingly, the compensation cost of stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
Companys stock at the date of grant over the exercise price and is charged to operations either when earned or over the vesting period. Income tax benefits attributable to stock options exercised are credited to paid-in capital. If compensation expense for stock options awarded under the
Companys plans had been determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Companys pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share would have been as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Restated Restated in thousands, except per share data Net loss as reported

During the
process of calculating what compensation expense would have been in 2002 had the Company accounted for employee stock options under the provisions of SFAS 123, whereby the fair value of stock option grants are considered compensation expense, the
Company determined that there was an error in the calculation of such expense in 2001 and 2000. Due to the correction of this error, the compensation expense included in the pro forma net loss above increased by $42 million and $14 million in 2001
and 2000, respectively. The effects of applying
SFAS No. 123 in the pro forma net loss disclosures above are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma disclosures of future years. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:  Year Ended December 31 2002

Risk-free interest rate

Cash
and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Although cash balances are maintained in high quality financial institutions,
the balances at times exceed insurable amounts. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated principally using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to five years for computers and software, and five
to seven years for furniture and other. Purchased software and third-party costs incurred to develop software for internal use are capitalized and amortized principally over three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their
estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. GoodwillGoodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment on
an annual basis unless impairment indicators arise sooner. This statement eliminates goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires an initial assessment for goodwill impairment within six months of adoption and at least annually thereafter. The
Company adopted this pronouncement on January 1, 2002. The goodwill test for impairment consists of a two-step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step of the process is a screen for potential
impairment and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. SFAS No. 142 requires an entity to complete the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test within six months of adopting the statement. The Company performed the
required transitional fair value impairment test on our goodwill as of January 1, 2002. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company no longer records goodwill amortization see Note 5. The Company performed its annual goodwill
impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2002 and determined that no impairment had occurred. The Company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test annually, as well as when a triggering event indicating impairment may have occurred.

Net
Loss Income Per ShareIn accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic net loss income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net loss income
per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive securities that were outstanding during each period. The Company had net losses for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. As a result, none of the options outstanding during those
periods were included in the computations of net loss per share since they were antidilutive. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying values of the Companys assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these financial instruments.
Foreign Currency TranslationThe
Companys financial statements were prepared in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Under this method, net foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. Comprehensive IncomeThe Company reflects its comprehensive income such as unrealized gains and losses on the Companys foreign currency translation adjustments and available-for-sale securities as a separate
component of stockholders equity as required by SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. The Company has not recorded the tax effects related to the currency translation adjustments because such adjustments relate to indefinite
investments in international subsidiaries. The
components of accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are as follows:  December 31 2002

Accounting Pronouncements In July 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 replaces EITF No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including
Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred 
37 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan, as was required by EITF No. 94-3. Examples of costs covered by SFAS No.
146 include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or disposal activities. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied to exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Other, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements of
guarantees and obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur and the identification of those contingent obligations to make future payments if those triggering
events or conditions occur. Additional disclosures have been added to the Commitments and Contingencies footnote describing the nature of the guarantee, the amount and event triggering the Companys obligation under the guarantee and its
recourse to recover in such an event see Note 14. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of SFAS No. 123, which provides optional transition guidance for those companies
electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 123. In addition, the statement mandates certain interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by SFAS No. 123. The Company will continue to account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with APB No. 25. As such, the Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS
No. 148 as of December 31, 2002. NOTE
2.Discontinued Operations and Restatement of Prior Period Financial Results In the third quarter of 2002, the operations of the Companys offices in Toronto, Munich, Germany and Hong Kong ceased. In accordance
with SFAS No. 144, the results of these operations have been reclassified and are separately presented for all reporting periods as discontinued operations. Revenues for discontinued operations were $24 million, $92 million and $112 million for
the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In connection with the reclassification of the results of these operations, the Company also noted certain errors within accrued liabilities associated with its continuing operations that were generated in prior periods. Therefore,
the Company has restated its historical results to adjust for these items. The impact of these adjustments served to decrease or increase selling, general and administrative expenses and the loss from continuing operations before income taxes by
approximately $01 million in the first quarter of 2002, $01 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, $04 million in 2000 and increase the income from continuing operations before income taxes by $03 million unaudited in 1999. The correction
for these items had no impact on the timing or amount of the Companys revenue or cash flow. The impact of the restatement on the net income loss for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 1999

NOTE
3.CentrPort Transactions and Investment The Company and certain employees formed CentrPort LLC in November 1999 to focus on developing intelligent marketing platforms to build and enhance customer relationships across multiple communication channels. In December
2000, CentrPort LLC, which was originally organized as a Delaware limited liability company, was reorganized as CentrPort, Inc. CentrPort, a Delaware corporation. Immediately after this reorganization, the Company sold a portion of its
ownership in CentrPort, which was formerly our majority-owned subsidiary. A consortium of third party investors the CentrPort Investors purchased 8,332,000 shares of preferred stock of CentrPort from the Company CentrPort
Preferred Stock Sale in exchange for $25 million in cash and a $25 million note receivable originally due in December 2001, subject to certain conditions. In addition, the Company received a warrant to purchase 391,604 shares of CentrPort
common stock from CentrPort CentrPort Warrant. Concurrent with the CentrPort Preferred Stock Sale, the CentrPort Investors agreed to invest up to $220 million directly into CentrPort. At the closing of the transaction, $165 million was paid by the CentrPort Investors to
CentrPort in exchange for 36,660,800 shares of newly issued CentrPort preferred stock. Subject to CentrPorts securing certain revenue commitments by April 1, 2001, an additional payment of $55 million Contingent Payment would be
due from the CentrPort Investors to CentrPort in December 2001. CentrPort did not secure these certain commitments and as such the Contingent Payment was not made by the CentrPort Investors to CentrPort. In addition, concurrent with the CentrPort Preferred Stock
Sale, the Company purchased 1,842,657 shares ofCentrPort common stock from certain minority CentrPort stockholders in exchange for approximately $19million of its common stock, or 315,858 shares the Founders Stock
Transaction. In connection with the Founders Stock Transaction, the Company recorded a charge to equity of approximately $14 million based on the excess of the value paid for the founders stock and its estimated fair value on the
date we acquired the stock. The CentrPort
Preferred Stock Sale, the CentrPort Warrant, the investment by the CentrPort Investors directly into CentrPort and the Founders Stock Transaction are hereinafter collectively referred to as the CentrPort Transactions. As a result
of the CentrPort Transactions, the Companys ownership in CentrPort preferred and common stock, combined, was reduced from 590% to 152%, which was later reduced as discussed below. Through the date of the CentrPort Transactions, the
Companys consolidated CentrPort and recognized 100% of the losses incurred by CentrPort in consideration that the Company was CentrPorts sole funding source. Such losses aggregated approximately $57 million. Subsequent to the CentrPort
Transactions, the Company has accounted for its investment in CentrPort under the cost method. In conjunction with the CentrPort Transactions, the Company designated CentrPort as a preferred vendor and committed to resell at least $50 million of CentrPorts products and services during
2001 pursuant to a value added reseller agreement CentrPort Commitment. Based primarily on the uncertain nature of the Companys ability to meet this CentrPort Commitment, the Company deferred its gain of $41 million on the
CentrPort Preferred Stock Sale. The original agreement provided that, if the CentrPort Commitment was not met, the Company was to remit the value of the shortfall to CentrPort in either CentrPort common stock from the Companys holdings
pursuant to a contractual per share fixed value, or in cash, at the Companys election. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had sold $27 million in CentrPort products and services applicable to the CentrPort Commitment. As a result, the
Company recognized $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 of the $41 million deferred gain that was recorded as of December 31, 2000. The remaining balance of the deferred gain on the Companys balance sheet was equal to $23 million as of
December 31, 2001. In February 2002, the Company, CentrPort and the CentrPort Investors were party to agreements which amended various conditions and commitments including the extinguishment of the Companys CentrPort Commitment to sell further 39 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued CentrPort products and services, the extinguishment of the Companys obligation to pay the value of the shortfall in either cash or
CentrPort common stock and the extension of the Companys $25 million note receivable due from the CentrPort Investors to it until December 31, 2002, which was subsequently satisfied. Accordingly, the Company recognized the remaining deferred
gain of $23 million in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, as a result of a valuation the Company received from an independent firm regarding the Companys investment in CentrPort as of December 31, 2001, the Company concluded that its investment in CentrPort was impaired.
Accordingly, the Company reduced its investment in CentrPort from $37 million, reflected at December 31, 2000, to $05 million by recording a $32 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001. In October 2002, CentrPort closed on a second series of
equity financing whereby CentrPort issued new equity to some of the CentrPort Investors in exchange for cash the Secondary Financing. The Company did not participate in the Secondary Financing. As a result of the Secondary Financing,
the Companys ownership interest in CentrPorts common and preferred stock was reduced from 152% to 89%. NOTE 4.Acquisitions and Dispositions In March 2000, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding capital stock of its affiliate in So
Paulo, Brazil Modem Media Brazil from its former parent, True North Communications Inc. True North for $01 million in cash. Because the transaction occurred among True North and majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries,
the transaction was recorded at historical cost. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of Modem Media Brazil have been included in the Companys consolidated financial
statements from the date of its acquisition. In
February 2000, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Vivid Holdings, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary, Vivid Publishing, Inc. collectively, Vivid, for $636 million. Vivid was a professional services
company with approximately 100 employees that provided engineering and information architecture services primarily to internet start-ups. The consideration was comprised of $102 million in cash, 446,010 shares of Modem Media common stock at $144
million and $390 million in value related to employee stock options that were converted to Modem Media stock options. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of Vivid have
been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of its acquisition. The allocation of the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired of $645million was being amortized over a
five-year period. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company concluded that the goodwill associated with theVivid acquisition was impaired, resulting in the write-off of the unamortized balance of $528 million
seeNote5. In February 2000, the
Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Eurokapi Multimedia S.A. Eurokapi, a builder and marketer of e-businesses in Paris, France, for $05 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of Eurokapi have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements from the date of its acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the net assets acquired of $05 million was
being amortized over a five-year period. However, due to adverse market conditions and lower revenues in the Companys Paris office managements estimates of such offices future operating performance and cash flows declined
substantially. Based on the revised estimates, management determined that the value of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Eurokapi was not recoverable and recorded an impairment charge of $03 million in the third quarter of 2001 see
Note 5. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company ceased its operations in Paris, France. 
40 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
NOTE
5.Goodwill Impairment Modem Media MunichIn accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company performed the required transitional impairment test on its goodwill as of January 1, 2002. As a result of completing this test, the Company determined that
the goodwill associated with its Munich operation was fully impaired as of January 1, 2002. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $34 million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change retroactive to January 1, 2002.
There was no income tax benefit associated with this charge as the Company believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income in Germany will not be sufficient to realize the related income tax benefit. Modem Media FranceDuring 2001, Modem Media France
experienced material, adverse changes in market conditions, operating results and cash flows. As a result, the Company performed an evaluation of the recoverability of its long-lived assets. Based on this evaluation, the Company concluded that the
value of its goodwill associated with Modem Media France was impaired. As a result, the unamortized balance of $03million was written off during the third quarter of 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company made the decision to
restructure its operations in Paris, France. As a result of this planned restructuring, the Company recorded a $12 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2001 see Note 6. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company ceased its operations in Paris,
France. VividLate in the fourth
quarter of 2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the Vivid business weakened significantly. Specifically, the number of Vivid employees continued to decrease, new assignments that would utilize the skills of the remaining Vivid
employees were not secured and market conditions impacted the ability of Internet start-ups to utilize the Companys services. Due to the significance of these developments, the Company performed an evaluation of the recoverability of its
goodwill. Based on this evaluation, the Company concluded that the remaining value of its goodwill associated with the Vivid transaction was impaired. As a result, the unamortized balance of $528 million was written off in the fourth quarter of
2000 and is included in Impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. Modem Media JapanDuring 2000, Modem Media Japan experienced material adverse changes in market conditions and a gradual
worsening of its client relationships, which led to substantial declines in the offices operating results and cash flows. Due to these developments, the Company performed an evaluation of the recoverability of its goodwill. Based on this
evaluation, the Company concluded that the value of its goodwill associated with Modem Media Japan was impaired. As a result, the unamortized balance of $15 million was written off during the fourth quarter of 2000 and is included in
Impairment of goodwill in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. During 2001, the Company ceased operations and closed the office in Tokyo, Japan. NOTE 6.Restructuring and Other Charges, Net
Continuing Operations
The Company initiated a series
of restructuring actions in 2002 to align capacity with both revenue and the demand from its clients. These actions were completed in the third and fourth quarters of 2002 and included staff reductions of 35 employees and a reduction in office space
in the Companys U.S. and London offices. As a result of these actions, restructuring charges of $154 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2002. 
41 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
In 2001,
the Company implemented various restructuring plans to reduce the Companys operating expenses and strengthen its competitive and financial positions. These actions, which were completed in the third quarter of 2001 and first quarter of 2002,
included the following: a staff reductions and an increase in the Companys accrual for excess office space in the Companys San Francisco office, established in 2000, b the closure of the Companys New York City office and its
subsequent consolidation into the Companys Norwalk, Connecticut office, c the decision to cease operations and close the Companys office in Tokyo, Japan, d the decision made in the fourth quarter of 2001 to cease operations in our
office in Paris, France and e the permanent decline in the value of certain marketable securities. As a result of these actions, restructuring charges of $126 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2001. In 2000, the Company recorded charges primarily related to
leased office space reductions in San Francisco and Tokyo, Japan, the reduction in headcount and reorganization of capacity across multiple offices and the write-off of deferred costs related to the proposed secondary public offering of the
Companys common stock that was cancelled. As a result of these actions, restructuring charges of $70 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2000. As a result of these office closures, restructuring and staff attrition, the Companys full-time
equivalent employees defined as employees plus temporary workers, were reduced by 662%, from 922 full-time equivalents at September 30, 2000 to 312 full-time equivalents at December 31, 2002. Discontinued Operations As noted above, due to the decline in client demand, the
Company decided in the second quarter of 2002 to close its offices in Toronto, Munich and Hong Kong, which ceased their operations in the third quarter of 2002. As a result of this decision, there were staff reductions of 52 employees for the
closedown period during 2002 and restructuring charges of $34 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2002. These charges are recorded within the operating loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. In 2001, the Company
approved various restructuring plans to reduce the Companys operating expenses and strengthen its competitive and financial positions. These actions, which were completed by the fourth quarter of 2001, include staff reductions and the
cancellation of the Companys move to new office space in Toronto as a result of the landlords breach of contract. As a result of these actions, restructuring charges of $18 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2001.
These charges are recorded within the operating loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

$03 million, $05 million and $04 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. NOTE 8.Debt Investment in CentrPortIn June 2000, the Company entered into an agreement that obligated it to purchase prior to December 2000 approximately 85% of the common stock of CentrPort
representing approximately 39% of the common stock of CentrPort after the CentrPort Transactions from a minority interest holder in exchange for $26 million comprised of a note for $18 million and cash of $08 million. The Company fulfilled
such obligation during the fourth quarter of 2000 by issuing a note payable due in 17 equal monthly installments, which had an interest rate of 95% per annum. The principal balance of the note was paid in full in 2002. At December 31, 2001 the
balance of the note was $05 million. DLC
ManagementIn November 2000, DLC Management advanced to the Company funds for leasehold improvements at the Companys Norwalk, Connecticut office. Payments for these advances are to be made in 98 equal monthly installments and bear an
interest rate of 100% per annum. The total outstanding amount of these advances was $03 million and $04 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for which the current portion is included in Accrued expenses and other current
liabilities and the long-term portion is included in Other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Interest ExpenseThe Company incurred interest expense on all borrowings, including those from related parties, of $08
million, $06 million and $02 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Related party interest expense in the respective totals above are $01 million, $01 million and $00 million. Interest expense is reported
within other expenses, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. NOTE 9.Equity Stock Repurchase PlanIn October 2002, the Company established a program to repurchase over an eighteen month period up to $50 million of the Companys common stock. During 2002, the Company repurchased
12,690 shares of common stock at an average price of $249 per share under this program. Shares purchased are included in treasury stock. Stockholder Rights PlanIn June 2001, the Company announced the adoption of a Stockholder Rights Plan the Plan.
Under the Plan, each stockholder of record at the close of business on June 28, 2001 received a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held. The rights trade with the Companys common stock until they become exercisable. The
rights will become exercisable and will detach from the common stock only if 
44 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued any person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Companys common stock subject to certain exceptions, an
Acquiring Person or commences a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more of the Companys common stock. Each right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of new series of participating
preferred stock at an initial purchase price of $30 per share. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock for issuance on the exercise of the rights. If any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each
right will entitle the holder, other than the Acquiring Person, to purchase for the initial purchase price the Companys common stock having a value of twice the initial purchase price. If the Company is later acquired in a merger or similar
transaction, or sells or transfers more than 50% of its assets or earning power, each right will entitle the holder to purchase for the initial purchase price common stock of the other party to such transaction having a value of twice the initial
purchase price. The Board of Directors may redeem the rights at a price of $0001 per right at any time prior to a specified period of time after a person has become an Acquiring Person. The rights will expire in June 2011 unless earlier exchanged
or redeemed. The existing reported shareholdings
of the Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. IPG and its affiliates and associates will not trigger any rights under the Plan so long as IPG and its affiliates and associates do not acquire any additional shares of the Companys
common stock as IPG acquired True North during 2001 see Note 12. Generally, the holders of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of common stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, quarterly dividends
payable in cash in an amount per share equal to 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in shares of common stock payable on any common stock. Each
share of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock will entitle its holder to 100 votes. Stock Option Exchange OffersIn October 2001, the Company completed a voluntary stock option offer for its eligible employees. Participating employees had the opportunity to cancel
previously granted options with an exercise price greater than $600 per share in exchange for an equal number of new options which were granted on April 17, 2002. The exercise price of these new options was set at $415, which was the fair market
value of the Companys common stock as of April 17, 2002. As a result of this program, 75,800 options were canceled in October 2001 and 70,800 options were granted on April 17, 2002. In May 2001, the Company completed a voluntary stock option exchange offer for its eligible employees and
directors. Participating employees and directors had the opportunity to cancel previously granted options with an exercise price greater than $600 per share in exchange for an equal number of new options which were granted on November 30, 2001. The
exercise price of these new options was set at $394 which was the fair market value of the Companys common stock as of November 30, 2001. As a result of this program, 2,477,001 options were canceled in May 2001 and 2,250,251 options were
granted on November 30, 2001. Common
StockPrior to June 5, 2000, the Companys common stock consisted of Class A and Class B shares. On that date, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Companys certificate of incorporation to eliminate
references to the Companys Class B common stock, reclassify the Companys Class A common stock as common stock and increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance to 145,000,000. At the time of the amendment, no
shares of Class B common stock were outstanding. Conversion of Class B Common StockOn April 26, 2000, True North and its subsidiaries converted all of their shares of the Companys Class B common stock into shares of the Companys Class A common stock. As a
result, True North and its subsidiaries combined voting power in the Company was reduced below 50% of total voting power. 
45 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Stock
SplitsOn March 1, 2000, the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split, paid in the form of a stock dividend, of its outstanding common stock. On February 3, 1999, the Company effected a 095-for-1 reverse stock split of its outstanding common
stock. All historical share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect these stock splits. Registration Rights AgreementIn August 1999, the Company and True North entered into a registration rights agreement that
contains provisions granting certain holders of common stock the right to participate in certain registrations of the Companys common stock, subject to limitations outlined therein. In addition, the agreement also provides certain holders the
right to initiate the registration of their securities, subject to timing and other limitations. In June 2001, IPG acquired True North. As of August 2002, this agreement expired. Stockholders AgreementThe Company is party to a Stockholders Agreement dated May 4,
1999, as amended, with True North, G.M. OConnell, the Companys Chairman, and Robert C. Allen II, the Companys former President and Chief Operating Officer, currently a Managing Director, pursuant to which all of the parties have
agreed that until True North no longer owns at least 10% of the Companys outstanding capital stock, such parties would take all actions necessary in order to cause the election of a least one director designated by True North to the Board of
Directors of the Company and as long as each Messrs. OConnell and Allen serves the Company as an executive officer, the parties to such agreement have agreed to take all actions necessary in order to cause each of their election to the
Companys Board of Directors. In June 2001, IPG acquired True North. Since October 2001, two IPG designees serve on the Companys Board of Directors. WarrantIn August 1999, the Company entered into an agreement to provide $120 million of services to General Electric Company
GE through September 30, 2000. In conjunction with GEs commitment to purchase the aforementioned services, the Company granted General Electric Capital Corporation a warrant to purchase 190,000 shares of the Companys common
stock at $1216 per share, which is the average of the high and low trading prices during the five trading days prior to the grant date. The warrant vested immediately and expires in August 2004. The fair value of this warrant, as determined by
independent appraisal, was $06 million, which was reflected as a reduction of revenues ratably as services were provided. Revenues were reduced by $02 million and $02 million during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Since
GE did not fulfill its commitment prior to September 30, 2000, the unamortized balance of $02 million was written off in the third quarter of 2000 and is included in Selling, general and administrative in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations. Preferred
StockPreferred stock may be issued, from time to time, pursuant to a resolution by the Companys Board of Directors that will set forth the voting powers and other pertinent rights of each series. NOTE 10. Stock Purchase Plan In February 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan under which a total of 1,900,000 shares of its common stock have been reserved for issuance. The Purchase Plan, which is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase
plan within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, provides for consecutive, overlapping 24-month offering periods. Each offering period contains four six-month purchase periods. Each participant will be granted an option to
purchase the Companys common stock on the first day of each of the six-month purchase periods and such option will be automatically exercised on the last day of each such purchase period. The purchase price of each share of common stock under
the Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value per share of common stock on the starting date of that offering period or on the date of the purchase. Offering periods begin on the first trading day on or after February
15 and August 15 of every year and terminate twenty-four months later.

Employees
are eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan if they are employed by the Company, or a subsidiary of the Company designated by the Board of Directors, for at least 20 hours per week and for more than five months in any calendar year. The
Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of an employees compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employees may modify or end their participation in the
offering at any time during the offering period or on the date of purchase, subject to certain limitations. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with the Company. The purchase plan will terminate in 2009 unless sooner
terminated by the Companys Board of Directors. NOTE

the Companys senior management may be compensated. The compensation committee administers the MIP. Pursuant to the MIP, the compensation committee in the first 90 days of a performance period will establish the identity of participants in the
MIP for that period, goals for these participants and the percentage of these participants salary to be based on these goals. The MIP provides for the award of compensation in common stock, of which 800,000 shares were made available, and cash
of up to $25 million per participant per year. The allocation of an award between stock and cash is at the discretion of the compensation committee. The compensation committee will determine the amount of award a participant has earned within 90
days of the end of the performance period. As of December 31, 2002, no common stock or cash was issued under the MIP. 2000 Incentive PlanDuring 2000, the Company adopted a stock incentive plan pursuant to which a total of 400,000 shares of the
Companys common stock have been reserved for issuance. Pursuant to the stock incentive plan, the Company may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, merit awards, performance awards and other stock-based awards to the
Companys employees excluding executive officers, directors and consultants. The plan is administered by the compensation committee. The compensation committee interprets and construes the provisions of the plan, adopts rules for
administering the plan and specifies the vesting, exercise prices including but not limited to, exercise prices at below fair market value as of the date of grant, and other terms of grants of equity awards under the plan. As of December 31, 2002,
stock options to purchase 125,732 shares of the Companys common stock were outstanding under this plan. 2000 Restricted Stock PlanIn December 2000, the Modem Media 2000 Restricted Stock Plan became effective. This restricted

restricted stock plan representing 10% of the Companys common stock ownership in CentrPort. Under this restricted stock plan, the Company may grant common stock of CentrPort to its employees which will vest at the end of either a lock-up
period after the initial public offering of CentrPorts stock or upon a liquidity event any event in which the Company disposes of any of its stake in CentrPort in exchange for cash or property other than unregistered or restricted stock. An
employee could not resell the stock until it vests and, until an initial public offering of CentrPort, the Company retains the right to vote any stock granted to its employees. If the employee is terminated for any reason, all unvested stock will be
forfeited and reacquired by the Company at no cost. The Companys compensation committee administers this restricted stock plan. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had not granted any stock under this plan. As of March 3, 2003, the board of
directors terminated this restricted stock plan.

option plan and specifies the vesting, exercise price and other terms of options and stock purchase rights. The maximum term of an incentive stock option granted under the 1997 Plan is generally limited to ten years. The exercise price of incentive
stock options granted under the 1997 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, as defined. As of December 31, 2002, stock options to purchase 3,382,049 shares of the Companys
common stock were outstanding under this plan. In connection with the transfer to True North of the non-strategic digital interactive marketing operations by the Company, True North agreed to satisfy options to purchase up to an aggregate of 281,010 shares of the Companys
common stock held by employees of such operations, as well as options to purchase an aggregate of 298,022 shares of the Companys common stock held by former employees of the Poppe Tyson Strategic Interactive Marketing Operations under the 1997

Modem Partnership were reserved for issuance. The Modem Partnership ceased to have its own separate existence prior to the Companys initial public offering in February 1999 and the Company assumed the terms and the conditions of this option
plan. Pursuant to the terms of the option plan, Units acquired under the option plan were converted into shares of the Companys common stock and options to acquire Units were converted into options to acquire shares of the Companys
common stock. Options to purchase 690,492 shares of common stock, which vested immediately and expire on September 30, 2006, were issued under this plan at an exercise price of $032 per share, of which 90,630 were outstanding as of December 31,

12.Related Party Transactions CentrPort TransactionsIn conjunction with the CentrPort Transactions, the Company designated CentrPort as a preferred vendor and entered into the CentrPort Commitment see Notes 3 and 14. The Company paid CentrPort $17
million, $24 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for services performed. In 2000, certain of the Companys executive officers and employees were granted 810,000 options, in the
aggregate, to purchase shares of CentrPort pursuant to the CentrPort Stock Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2002, 525,000 of such options were outstanding to the Companys executive offices and employees. Pursuant to the CentrPort
Transactions, the Company designated G.M. OConnell, its Chairman of the Board, to be a member of CentrPorts Board of Directors. IPG RelationshipIn June 2001, IPG completed its acquisition of True North. On September 1, 1998, the Company entered
into a sublease with Bozell, Jacob, Kenyon and Eckhardt, Inc. Bozell, a subsidiary of IPG, pursuant to which the Company leases office space in New York City. The rent per square foot under the sublease agreement is based on the
average monthly rent per square foot and other related costs under Bozells underlying lease. Rental payments made to Bozell by the Company under the terms of the lease agreement for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $07
million, $09 million and $07 million, respectively. Lease GuaranteesIPG, through True North, is guarantor for the Companys obligations under its lease which expires in January 2009, subject to renewal, for office space at its Norwalk, Connecticut office. As of
December 31, 2002, the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses due under this lease was $185 million, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the lease. IPG, through True North, is also guarantor for the Companys
obligations under one capital lease for various furniture which expires November 2003. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate remaining balance under this furniture lease was $01 million. Pursuant to the Companys agreement with IPG, the
Company is responsible for certain of IPGs expenses related to the cost of this guarantee. This cost is calculated monthly at 05% of the remaining balance of each lease. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Companys expense related
to this guarantee was $01 million. NOTE 13.
Employee Benefit Plans The Company maintains a profit-sharing plan with a 401k feature for the benefit of its eligible employees. There is no minimum length of service required to participate in the plan and employees of the Company are eligible to begin
participation on designated quarterly enrollment dates provided that they have reached 21 years of age. The Company makes annual matching and/or profit-sharing contributions to the plan at its discretion. In addition, certain employees of the
Company have participated in other similar defined contribution plans. Such employees subsequently became participants of the aforementioned profit-sharing plan. The Company also maintains various benefit plans for its international employees. The
Company may make discretionary contribution to these plans. The aggregate cost of contributions made by the Company to all employee benefit plans was $06 million, $08 million and $06 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and

In
connection with certain leases of office space, the Company has $26 million invested in highly liquid, short-term investments as of both December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, against which the landlords of such space would be able to make
claims in the event of default by the Company of its lease obligations. Such amounts are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company is not aware of any existing defaults of its obligations under
these leases. Rent expense, including rent
expense resulting from leases with related parties see Note 12, was $43million, $55 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company is guarantor for CentrPorts obligations under its lease for office space at 450 Post Road
East, Westport, Connecticut for 16,900 square feet, which expires on June 30, 2010, subject to renewal. As of December 31, 2002, the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses due under this lease was $63million, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the terms of the lease. This balance reduces by approximately $08 million per year through June 30, 2010. The lease provides that once 50% of the original lease term has expired, which will occur in July 2005, this
guaranty may be replaced with an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount not to exceed the remaining base rent. Upon expiration of 50% of the lease term, CentrPort is required to obtain such a letter of credit.
Additionally, CentrPort has agreed to cooperate with the Company to secure the Companys release from its guaranty prior to that time, if possible. In the event that CentrPort were to default on its lease obligation, the Company would be liable
for the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses at the time of default by CentrPort. In the event of a default, the Company would take all appropriate action to be reimbursed for this liability. As of December 31, 2002, no
provision has been recorded for this potential liability. Employment AgreementsDuring January 2001, the Company entered into a three-year employment agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer for an initial base salary of $05 million. If the Company were to
terminate the executive, the minimum payout under such agreement would be $05 million and the executive would be entitled to a portion of his merit bonus earned in the year of termination calculated at the Companys performance levels as of
the date of the executives termination and projected through the end of the year in which the executives termination occurs.

Accrued
BonusesAccrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include accrued bonuses of $22 million and $29 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. LitigationBeginning in August 2001, a number of
substantially identical class action complaints alleging violations of the federal securities laws were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York naming as defendants Modem Media, Inc., certain of our officers
G.M. OConnell, Chairman, Steven Roberts, former Chief Financial Officer, and, in certain actions, Robert C. Allen II, board member, a Managing Director and former President, and certain named underwriters of our initial public offering
FleetBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., BankBoston Robertson Stephens, Inc., Bear Stearns Co., Inc., Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities and Banc of America Securities LLC. The complaints have since been consolidated into a single action, and a
consolidated amended complaint was filed on April 24, 2002. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the underwriters of our initial public offering violated the securities laws by failing to disclose certain alleged compensation
arrangements such as undisclosed commissions or stock stabilization practices in the offerings registration statement and by engaging in manipulative practices to artificially inflate the price of Modem Media stock in the after-market
subsequent to the IPO. We and the officers are named in the amended complaint pursuant to Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10b and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on the basis of an alleged failure to
disclose the underwriters alleged compensation arrangements and manipulative practices. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. Similar complaints have been filed against over 300 other issuers that have had initial public offerings since
1998 and all such actions have been included in a single coordinated proceeding. In October 2002, the actions against the individual defendants were dismissed without prejudice. In July 2002, we and the other issuers in the consolidated cases filed motions to dismiss the amended
complaint for failure to state a claim, which was denied as to us on February 19, 2003. We intend to defend these actions vigorously. However, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the
litigation. Any unfavorable outcome of this litigation could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In August 2001, the Companys subsidiary, Modem Media Canada, Inc. Modem Media Canada, brought suit against Citi Core
Properties, Ltd. Landlord in Ontario Supreme Court for breach of an office lease on the basis that the Landlord did not complete the building into which Modem Media Canada was to move the Space. Modem Media Canada is
claiming approximately $12 million in damages. The Landlord has counter-sued the Company, Modem Media Canada and certain of the Companys officers and directors for breach of lease and is seeking damages in the amount of approximately $160
million. After the Landlord counter-sued the Company, the Landlord went into receivership. The Space was repossessed by a mortgage holder and is being sold to an unrelated third party. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the
counter-claims and intends to defend this action vigorously. The Company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. 
52 Table of Contents MODEM MEDIA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
From time
to time, the Company becomes involved in various routine legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Other than as noted above, the Company believes that the outcome of pending legal proceedings and unasserted claims in the aggregate
will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. NOTE 15.Income Taxes The components of loss income from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:  Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 Restated inthousands Restated Domestic

At
December 31, 2002, the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of $324 million, which may be used to offset future taxable income, if any. The Companys net operating loss carryforward results from $182 million of unused tax benefits
from the exercise of stock options and $142 million of operating losses. Certain of the Companys net operating losses may be carried forward for periods ranging from five to twenty years and others may be carried forward indefinitely. A
valuation allowance of $13 million has been established for a portion of the total deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of certain of the Companys international subsidiaries. The Company has concluded that, as a result of
IPGs acquisition of True North see Note 12, it has undergone an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and estimates that its U.S. federal net operating loss carry forward generated prior to the ownership
change is subject to an annual limitation of approximately $45 million. NOTE 16.Geographic Information Information about the Companys operations in different geographic regions as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is as follows:  December 31 2002

The
quarterly earnings per share data above are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. As such, the sum of the quarterly per common share information may not equal the full year amounts due to rounding differences resulting from
changes in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company reduced staff, primarily in Europe, to better align capacity with the demand from its clients. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $06
million for the three months ended March 31, 2002. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company announced its decision to close its offices in Toronto, Munich and Hong Kong. Operations in these offices ceased in the third quarter of 2002 and as a result, in accordance with SFAS No.
144, the results of these operations have been reclassified and are separately presented in the consolidated statements of operations for all reporting periods as discontinued operations. The Company noted certain errors within accrued liabilities
associated with the Companys continuing operations that were generated in prior periods; therefore, the Company has restated its historical results to adjust for these items. The restatement of selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased the total amount of the first quarter 2002 net loss by $01 million and increased the fourth quarter 2001 net loss by $01 million. Net loss per share was not impacted see Note 2. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company initiated a series
of global restructuring actions to align capacity with revenue. These actions, which were completed in the third quarter of 2002, include a reduction in office space in Norwalk, Connecticut and London and staff reductions in most of the
Companys other offices including the Companys headquarters. As a result of these actions, restructuring charges of $73 million were recorded for the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2002, net income included $09 million of a pre-tax benefit from the favorable
settlement of previously accrued liabilities.

In the
fourth quarter of 2002, due to a significant and rapid deterioration in the commercial real estate market in San Francisco, Norwalk and London, the Company adjusted facility-related accruals previously established and recorded a restructuring charge
of $76 million for excess facilities. Such increase represents an adjustment to the Companys original estimate of the present value of future rent payments in excess of anticipated sublease income, expected subtenant allowances and estimated
brokers fees. In the first quarter of
2001, the Company implemented a series of restructuring actions across the entire organization that resulted in a decrease of approximately 10% of the Companys employees. These actions included a reduction in corporate staff, the decision to
close the Companys office in Tokyo, Japan, which ceased operations during the second quarter of 2001 and the realignment of capacity across multiple offices. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of
$24 million during the three months ended March 31, 2001. In addition, the Company recorded an other than temporary, non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge of $04 million related to a permanent decline in the value of certain marketable securities.
In the second quarter of 2001, due to the
significant and rapid deterioration in the San Francisco commercial real estate market, the Company increased its accrual for excess office space by $57 million. Such increase represents an adjustment to the Companys original estimate of the
present value of future rent payments in excess of anticipated sublease income, expected subtenant allowances and estimated brokers fees. The Company also canceled its plan to move its Toronto operations to new office space due to the
landlords breach of the lease agreement. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $11 million to write off certain leasehold improvements and other assets that no longer have future value to the Company. In addition, the Company
continued to realign capacity across multiple offices and reduce headcount, which resulted in a charge of $10million. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company made the decision to consolidate its office in New York City with its office in Norwalk,
Connecticut. In conjunction with such decision, the Company recorded a charge of $25million. In addition, due to adverse market conditions and lower revenues in the Companys Paris, France office, the Companys estimates of such
offices future performance and cash flows declined substantially. Based on these revised estimates, the Company concluded that the goodwill associated with such office was not recoverable. As such, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
$03 million during the three months ended September 30, 2001 to write off the unamortized balance of such goodwill. Also, the Company commenced a series of reorganization actions which reduced the Companys total staff by 26 employees, or
approximately 50%. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $07 million during the three months ended September 30, 2001. Partially offsetting these charges was a reversal of a $06 million accrual related to the closing of the Tokyo,
Japan office, which ceased operations in the second quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company announced that it would restructure its Paris, France operations, which ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $12 million in the
three-month period ending December 31, 2001. In addition, the Company continued to realign capacity across multiple offices and reduced headcount further, which resulted in a charge of $14 million. Primarily offsetting these items was a reversal to
the accrual for the New York City office closure for $13million since the Company was able to sub-let the office space earlier than anticipated.
