AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Vitran Corporation Inc. as at December31, 2004
and 2003 and the consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004. Our audit also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index under Part IV, a2. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as at December31, 2004 and 2003 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004 in accordance with Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly, in all material aspects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Vitran Corporation Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO and our report dated February7, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements

a
Description of the business     
Vitran Corporation Inc. Vitran or the Company is a North American provider of
freight services and distribution solutions to a wide variety of companies and
industries. Vitran offers less-than-truckload service throughout Canada and the United
States. Vitran Logistics offers supply chain solutions in Canada and the United States,
including warehousing, inventory management and flow-through distribution facilities, as
well as freight brokerage services. Vitran also provides same-day and next-day
truckload services in the United States.     
b
Basis of presentation     
These Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated on consolidation.     
All amounts in these Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in United States
dollars, unless otherwise stated.     
c
Foreign currency translation     
A majority of the Companys shareholders, customers and industry analysts are located in
the United States. Accordingly, the Company adopted the United States dollar as its
reporting currency effective December31, 2003 and all prior periods have been restated.     
The United States dollar is the functional currency of the Companys operations in the
United States. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Companys Canadian
operations.     
Each operation translates foreign currency-denominated transactions into its functional
currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction.     
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into
the functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving rise
to a gain or loss which is recognized in income during the current period.     
For reporting purposes, the Canadian operations are translated into United States
dollars using the current rate method. Under this method, all assets and liabilities
are translated at the year-end rate of exchange and all revenue and expense items are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. The resulting translation
adjustment is recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity. United States
dollar debt of $144million 2003-$261million is designated as a hedge of the
investment in the United States self-sustaining foreign operations. 30 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued
In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 1. Significant accounting policies continued   
In respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian
dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the
year-end rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on
the transaction dates. All of the exchange gains or losses resulting from these other
transactions are recognized in income.     
d
Revenue recognition     
The Companys less-than-truckload, truckload business units and freight brokerage
operations recognize revenue and direct shipment costs upon the delivery of the related
freight. Revenue for the Logistics operations is recognized as the management services
are provided.     
e
Cash and cash equivalents     
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on account and short-term investments with
maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and are stated at cost, which
approximates market value.     
f
Marketable securities     
Marketable securities are recorded at the lower of cost and market value. The
securities are classified as available for sale.     
g
Inventory     
Inventory consists of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost
and replacement cost.     
h
Capital assets     
Capital assets are recorded at cost. Depreciation of capital assets is provided on a
straight-line basis from the date assets are put in service over their estimated useful
lives as follows   
Buildings
20-315years   Leasehold interests and improvements
Over term of lease   Vehicles:
Trailers and containers
12years   Trucks
8years   Machinery and equipment
5-10years   31 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued
In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 1. Significant accounting policies continued   
Tires purchased as part of a vehicle are capitalized as a cost to the vehicle.
Replacement tires are expensed when placed in service.     
Effective January1, 2004, the Company changed the estimated useful life of its vehicles
and equipment to accurately reflect its actual useful life. The useful life of the
Companys trailers was changed from 10years to 12years and the trucks from 7years to
8years. As a result of the change, income from operations and net income were impacted
by $673 and $505, respectively, in 2004. Basic and diluted earnings per share were
impacted by $004, in 2004.     
i
Goodwill     
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired. Prior to January1, 2002, goodwill was amortized over 40years on
a straight-line basis. Effective January1, 2002, the Company no longer amortizes
goodwill but annually compares the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying
value to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. A transitional impairment was
recognized as an effect of a change in accounting policy and was charged to opening
retained earnings as of January1, 2002.     
At June30, 2002, the Company completed its initial goodwill impairment test and
concluded that an impairment existed. At September30, 2002, the amount of the charge
was quantified. Charges of $08million and $22million, respectively, were recorded
in the freight brokerage and the truckload reporting units to adjust the carrying value
of goodwill for each reporting unit to its implied fair value. Such amount has been
reflected as a direct charge to retained earnings effective January1, 2002.     
As at September30, 2004, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and
concluded there was no impairment. The change in goodwill is attributable to
translating the Canadian dollar denominated goodwill to the United States dollar
reporting currency.     
j
Income taxes     
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
the asset and liability method, future tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Future tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on future tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that
includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment. 32 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued
In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 1. Significant accounting policies continued   
k
Stock-based compensation     
Prior to January1, 2003, The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants CICA
Handbook Section3870, Stock-based Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments, required
that effective January1, 2002, all stock-based compensation to non-employees and direct
awards of stock to employees be accounted for using the fair value method. The Company
has not granted any such awards.     
The Company has a stock option plan for employees and directors. In 2002, in accordance
with the standard, the Company had elected to use the settlement method for stock
options granted to employees and no compensation expense was recorded. Consideration
paid by employees on the exercise of options is recorded as share capital.     
The CICA Accounting Standards Board amended CICA Handbook Section3870, Stock-based
Compensation and Other Stock-based Payments, to require entities to account for stock
options granted to employees and directors using the fair value-based method, beginning
January1, 2004, with the option to adopt effective January1, 2003. Under the fair
value-based method, compensation cost is measured at fair value at the date of grant and
is expensed over the awards vesting period, and forfeitures are accounted for as they
occur. In accordance with a transitional option permitted under amended CICA Handbook
Section3870, the Company has prospectively applied the fair value-based method to all
stock options granted on or after January1, 2003. Note 7d provides supplemental
disclosure for the Companys stock options.     
l
Advertising costs     
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $526 in 2004
2003-$501.     
m
Use of estimates     
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.     
n
Impairment of long-lived assets     
On January1, 2004, the Company adopted CICA Handbook Section3063, Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets, which establishes standards for recognizing, measuring and disclosing
impairment of long-lived assets held for use. An impairment is recognized when the
carrying amount of an asset to be held and used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash
flows expected from its use and disposal 33 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued
In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002   1.
Significant accounting policies continued   
and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeds its fair
value. A long-lived asset should be tested when events or circumstances indicate that
its carrying amount may not be recoverable. During 2004, the Company has not identified
any indicators that would require recognition of an impairment.     
o
Claims and insurance accruals     
Claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including
amounts for claims incurred but not reported, cargo loss and damage, bodily injury and
property damage, workers compensation, long-term disability and group health. In
Canada and the United States the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per
incident for auto liability, casualty and cargo claims. In the United States the
Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for workers compensation and
employee medical.   2.
Acquisitions and divestitures     
Environmental Services Group     
On May15, 2001, the Company determined that it planned to divest its Environmental Services
Business. A provision for the loss on sale of discontinued business was recorded to account
for the sale of capital assets and estimated realizable value of the remaining assets and
liabilities. Effective January2, 2002, the Company sold substantially all the capital
assets of the business for cash proceeds of $17million.     3.
Marketable securities     
The marketable securities are invested in highly rated treasury bills, investment grade notes
and investment grade commercial paper. A portion of the securities is invested in highly
rated preferred shares. The market value of all securities approximates the cost.     4.

The term bank credit facility is secured by accounts receivable and general
security agreements of the Company and of all its subsidiaries.     
During 2004, the Company repaid $117million of borrowings. At December31, 2004 144million 2003-$261million, bearing interest at 349% 2003-293%, was
drawn under this facility. The agreement requires approximately 21% of the total
principal to be repaid in 2005, with escalating annual repayments, payable in quarterly
instalments to September30, 2007. The provisions of the term facility impose certain
financial maintenance tests.     
b
The Company has financed certain equipment by entering into a capital leasing
arrangement expiring in 2007. The capital lease bears interest at approximately 679%.     
c
The Company has a revolving credit facility of up to $35million. At December
31, 2004, the Company had $306million unused in the credit facility, net of
outstanding letters of credit of $44million.   
At December31, 2004, the required future principal repayments on all long-term debt and
capital lease are as follows

Financial instruments The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate the carrying values because of the
short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt,
determined based on the future cash flows associated with each debt instrument discounted
using an estimate of the Companys current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of
comparable maturity, is approximately equal to the carrying values at December31, 2004 and

Total rental expense under operating leases was $167million for the year ended December31,

leases. If the market value of the assets at the end of the lease terms is less than the
guaranteed residual value, the Company must under certain circumstances compensate the lessor
for a portion of the shortfall. The maximum exposure under these guarantees is $83million.   12.
Contingent liabilities The Company is subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business.
In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these actions,
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of

In 2003, the Company had $264 of foreign exchange gains that
represented a substantially complete liquidation of a foreign operation that was
included in selling, general and administration expenses. As the foreign operation
was substantially liquidated, Canadian and United States GAAP require the transfer
into income of the related cumulative translation adjustment. In 2002, the Company had a $444 foreign exchange gain that did not represent a
substantially complete liquidation of a foreign operation included in selling,
general and administration expenses. This gain on repatriation of capital from a
subsidiary arose from the difference between the exchange rate in effect on the
date the capital was returned to Canada compared to the historical rate in effect
when the capital was invested. The gain was recognized upon the transfer into
income of the related cumulative translation adjustment under Canadian GAAP. Under
United States GAAP, there is no reduction of the cumulative translation adjustment
account, nor recognition of associated income resulting from such capital
restructurings. This transaction was not subject to income taxes. 47 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

A non-cash charge of $30million, to adjust the carrying value of
goodwill to its implied value, was included in opening retained earnings without the
restatement of prior period figures. This charge was the result of the Companys
adoption of the new Canadian accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles.
Under United States GAAP, FAS 142, the non-cash charge is not recorded as a charge
to opening retained earnings but rather as a charge to income in 2002.     
iii
The change in the fair value of the Companys obligation for its
interest rate swap, which is designated as a cash flow hedge, has been included net
of the income tax effect of nil 2003 $78; 2002 $474.

Stock-based compensation For all stock option grants prior to January1, 2003, stock-based compensation to
employees was accounted for based on the intrinsic value method under APB No25 and
related interpretations. In accordance with one of the transitional options permitted under amended FASB 148, the
Company has prospectively applied the fair value-based method to all stock options
granted on or after January1, 2003. Canadian GAAP requires pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosure for stock
option grants during 2002. United States GAAP requires pro forma net income and
earnings per share disclosure for stock options granted on or after January1, 1995.
For stock option grants on or after January1, 2003, there is no policy difference
between Canadian and United States GAAP. 49 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

New United States accounting pronouncement In May2003, FASB Statement No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity was issued. This Statement provides
guidance for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The requirements of FASB 150 do not
have an effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December2003, FASB Statement No132 revised, Employers Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits was issued. The Statement requires
additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic
benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans.
The requirements of FASB 132 reviseddo not have an effect on the Companys
Consolidated Financial Statements. In November2004, FASB Statement No 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4 was issued. The Statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of
idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. Additionally,
allocation of fixed overheads to the costs of conversion should be based on the normal
capacity of production facilities. The requirements of FASB 151 do not have an effect
on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December2004, FASB Statement No153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets An
Amendment to APB Opinion No29 was issued. The Statement eliminates the exception to
fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general
exception for exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance that is,
transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of
the reporting entity. The requirements of FASB 153 do not have an effect on the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. In December2004, FASB Statement No123 revised, Share-based Payment was issued.
This Statement requires an entity to recognize the grant-date fair value of stock
options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees in the income statement.
FASB 123 revisedeliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using the intrinsic value method in APB Opinion No25. The Company,
effective January1, 2003, adopted FASB Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation as amended by FASB Statement 148, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure, and will evaluate the effect of FASB No123 revisedon
the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Table of Contents Consolidated Supplemental Schedule of Quarterly Financial Information
