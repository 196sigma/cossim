22 This page intentionally blank 23 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
KMG Chemicals,Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KMG Chemicals,Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of July31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended July31, 2004. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, such
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of KMG Chemicals,Inc. and subsidiaries as of
July31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July31,2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES General
- - KMG Chemicals, Inc. the Company is principally involved in the
manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals in niche markets through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, KMG-Bernuth, Inc. The
Company sells three wood preserving chemicals - pentachlorophenol penta,
creosote and sodium pentachlorophenate sodium penta. The Company also sells
tetrachlorvinphos products, a pesticide sold to domestic livestock and poultry
growers under the Rabon trade name to protect animals from flies and other
pests; as well as an herbicide product consisting of monosodium and disodium
methanearsonic acids MSMA. The herbicide
product is sold by the Company in the United States as Bueno 6 to
protect cotton crops from weed growth and as Ansar 66 for
highway weed control. The Company manufactures penta, sodium penta and MSMA at its plant in
Matamoros, Mexico through KMG de Mexico KMEX, a Mexican corporation and a
9998% owned subsidiary of KMG-Bernuth.
The Company has three main suppliers of creosote, which it sells
throughout the United States. The
Company contracts with third parties for the supply of the Rabon active
ingredient, as well as the formulation and packaging of those products. The Companys significant accounting policies are as follows Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of KMG Chemicals, KMG-Bernuth, and KMEX. All significant inter-company accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The carrying value of financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable
approximate fair value because of the relatively short maturity of these
instruments. The fair value of the Companys
debt at July31, 2004 and 2003 was estimated to be the same as its
carrying value since the debt obligations bear interest at a rate consistent
with current market rates. In February2003,
the Company entered into an interest rate swap effectively to fix the interest
rate on the Companys term loan at 50% through December20, 2007 see
Note 8. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative and
Hedging Activities, this derivative instrument is accounted for as a cash flow
hedge. The swap is reported on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as
either an asset or a liability. As of July31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, an asset of $29,187 and $5,506 associated with this interest rate
swap was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gain or loss on the swap is
included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance
sheet. For the 29 year ended July31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, the Company recorded gains of $14,573 and $3,523
for other comprehensive income associated with this interest rate swap. The
effectiveness of the hedge was evaluated for the year ending July31,
2004. It was determined that the hedge
was successful at fixing the effective interest rate on the Companys term loan
at 50%. In accordance with
SFAS No. 133, certain criteria must be met before an interest rate swap or
other derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge. This includes
documentation at hedge inception of i the hedging relationship and the
Companys risk management objective and strategy for putting the hedge in place
and ii an indication that the hedging relationship is expected to be highly
effective in hedging the designated risk during the term of the hedge. The
effectiveness of the hedge is tested periodically and at least annually. The Companys hedging policy requires that
only risks i determined to have a potentially material impact on the
financial performance of the Company and ii for which there exists a perfect
hedge, employing financial instruments in a mature market, be considered for
hedging. Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in
first-out FIFO method. Property, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as
incurred. Income Taxes - Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the
asset and liability method in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Revenue Recognition The Company essentially has only one type of revenue
transaction in which the Companys chemical products sold in the open market
are recognized as revenue as risk and title to the products transfer to the
customers, which is usually at the time a shipment is made. Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per common share amounts are
calculated using the average number of common shares outstanding during each
period. Diluted earnings per share
assume the exercise of all stock options having exercise prices less than the
average market price of the common stock using the treasury stock method. Foreign Currency Translation - The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the
Companys foreign operations. For those
operations, re-measurements to U.S. dollars from currency translations are
included in the statement of income. Stock-Based Compensation - The Company has adopted SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Under SFAS No. 123, the Company is permitted to either record expenses
for stock options and other employee compensation plans based on their fair
value at the date of grant or to continue to apply its current accounting
policy under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB
No25 and recognize compensation expense, if any, based on the
intrinsic value of the equity instrument at the measurement date. The Company elected to continue following APB
No25 for stock options granted to employees; however, the Company
accounts for stock options granted to non-employees under the provisions of
SFAS No. 123. Intangible Assets For financial statement purposes, identifiable
intangible assets with a defined life are being amortized using the
straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets. Identifiable intangible assets of an
indefinite life are not amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other 30 Intangible Assets. These assets
are required to be tested for impairment annually at a minimum. The adoption of SFAS No. 142 by the Company
on August1, 2002 resulted in amortization expense decreasing by
approximately $300 thousand in fiscal year 2003 versus the previous year. Concentrations of Credit Risks - Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Although the amount of credit exposure to any
one institution may exceed federally insured amounts, the Company limits its
cash investments to high-quality financial institutions in order to minimize
its credit risk. With respect to accounts
receivable, such receivables are primarily from wood-treating manufacturers
located worldwide and agriculture chemicals distributors in the United
States. The Company extends credit based
on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without
requiring collateral. Exposure to losses
on receivables is dependent on each customers financial condition. At July31, 2004, one customer
represented 28% of the Companys accounts receivable. At July31, 2003, no customers
represented 10% or more of the Companys accounts receivable. Concentration of Operations in Other Countries The Company manufactures penta and MSMA at its plant in Matamoros,
Mexico. Property, plant and equipment on
the Companys consolidated balance sheet of $4,712,468 in 2004 and $5,034,443
in 2003 are assignable to the Companys plant in Mexico. This concentration of operations outside of
the Companys home country exposes the Company to the risk that its operations
may be disrupted in the future. New Accounting Standards Accounting pronouncements
that became effective in fiscal 2004 or that are expected to become effective
in fiscal2005 did not have, and are not expected to have, any significant
effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Effective August1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets, and requires that the balance sheet valuation
of goodwill and other intangible assets of indefinite life be evaluated for
impairment at least annually and requires that their regular charge, or
amortization, against income be discontinued. As of July31, 2004,
the Company has goodwill assets of $3,778,313 on its balance sheet and has performed
impairment analyses on its goodwill and intangible assets of indefinite life
which indicated as of July31, 2004 an impairment charge was not
appropriate. In February2003, SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement123
was issued. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No.
123 to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily
changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of that Statement
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an
entitys accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based
compensation. The Company has chosen not to voluntarily change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation but
has adopted the disclosure rules of SFAS No. 148. Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have
been made to conform to current year presentation. Segment Reporting - For purposes of financial disclosure, the Companys
operation is considered to be one business segment. 31 2. ACQUISITIONS In December2003, the Company purchased certain penta distribution
assets of Wood Protection Products, Inc.
As part of the purchase, the Company also granted an option to acquire
175,000 shares of its common stock, exercisable at $250 per share. The acquisition included distribution and
plant equipment, inventory, penta product registrations and a consulting and
non-compete agreement with the sellers principal shareholder. The cash purchase price was primarily
financed with a $6,000,000 term loan from SouthTrust Bank. The table summarizes the total amount paid
for the acquisition.

In June2004, the Company purchased
creosote product registrations from Trenton Sales, Inc. In connection with that purchase, the Company
entered into a supply agreement with Lufkin Creosoting Co., an affiliate of the
seller, by which the Company will sell Lufkin Creosoting its creosote
requirements for its wood treating operations.
The Company also obtained the sellers creosote supply agreement with a
Mexican producer of creosote. Although
the Company had been purchasing creosote from the Mexican 32 creosote producer prior to the acquisition,
the acquisition will have the effect of increasing the Companys purchases of
that lower cost creosote supply. The
Company also purchased the Ravap tradename and inventory from Boehringer
Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. in June2004.
That tradename is for a product that contains Rabon, the animal health
product registration line we acquired for $3,855,572 million in fiscal 2003
from Boehringer. This acquisition
extends our available Rabon product category.
The creosote distribution and Ravap acquisitions were completed using
available cash, borrowings under our revolving loan with SouthTrust Bank, and
by increasing one of our senior term loans with that bank by $2,954,000. Based on the size of these two acquisitions,
proforma information is not presented. 3. INVENTORIES Inventories are summarized as follows at July31

Approximately 84% of the Companys property, plant and equipment is
located in Matamoros, Mexico. Most of
the remaining long-lived assets are located at the Companys formulation and
distribution facility in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 33 Depreciation is principally computed using a straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation expense was $1,008,743, $955,911 and $648,503 in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The estimated
useful lives of classes of assets are as follows

5. FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT Monetary assets and liabilities and income items for KMEX are
re-measured to U.S. dollars at current rates, and certain assets notably plant
and production equipment are re-measured at historical rates. Expense items for KMEX are re-measured at
average monthly rates of exchange except for depreciation and amortization
expense. All gains and losses from
currency re-measurement for KMEX are included in operations. Foreign currency re-measurement resulted in
an aggregate exchange loss of $15,469, $37,798 and $2,971 in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. 6. INCOME TAXES The geographical sources of income before income taxes for each of the

8. LONG-TERM DEBT As of July31,2004 the Company had two term loans with
outstanding balances of $4,250,423 and $8,515,000 as well as a revolving credit
facility with no outstanding borrowings. Effective August1, 1996, the Company entered into a revolving
credit facility with SouthTrust Bank that provides for borrowings of up to
$3,500,000. The borrowing base under
this facility is limited by a formula based on the amount of the amount of
receivables and inventory. Interest
under the revolving note is due monthly at LIBOR plus 175% on outstanding
balances. The revolving note is secured
by the Companys receivables, inventory, and general intangible assets. The loan agreement includes, among other
things, restrictions on equity investments and loans made by the Company and
requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio and minimum
tangible net worth requirements. The
Company was in compliance with debt covenants as of July31, 2004. There were no amounts outstanding under the
revolving credit facility at July31, 2004 and 2003. The termination date of this loan agreement
is January31, 2005. The Company
anticipates no difficulties in renewing the revolving credit facility. The Companys fiscal 2003 purchase of the Rabon products category was
financed with a senior credit facility from SouthTrust Bank that also served to
refinance the Companys existing term loan facility with that bank. As refinanced, the principal balance outstanding
as of July31, 2004 was $4,250,423 while the principal balance was
$4,755,419 at July31, 2003. The
loan carries interest at a varying rate equal to LIBOR plus 18% 30% and 31%
at July31,2004 and 2003, respectively. In February2003, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap transaction with SouthTrust Bank that effectively
fixed the interest rate at 50% for the remainder of the term. At July31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with its various debt covenants which include restrictions on equity
investments and loans made by the 37 Company, and require the maintenance of a minimum fixed-charge coverage
ratio and minimum and ratio requirements on tangible net worth. The Companys debt matures at the rate of
$504,996 per year through December20, 2007, at which time $2,567,000 will
be due and payable. The acquisition of the Wood Protection Products assets in December2003,
and subsequently the Trenton Sales creosote distribution assets and the Ravap
tradename and inventory in June2004, were partially financed by a second
term loan from SouthTrust Bank. The
original principal amount of the second term loan was $6,000,000 on December5,
2003. In June 2004, after five months of
amortization, the loan was increased by an additional advance of $2,954,000 for
the purchase of the creosote business of Trenton Sales, Inc. and the Ravap
trade name. The principal amount is
being amortized monthly over seven years, but the maturity date is June1,
2009. The second term loan carries
interest at a varying rate initially equal to LIBOR plus 175% 29% at July31,2004. The principal amount of the loan was
$8,515,000 on July31,2004. Principal payments due under long-term debt agreements are as follows

Rent expense relating to the operating leases
was $424,210, $365,854 and $353,983 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Environmental The Companys operations are subject to extensive federal, state and
local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and abroad relating
to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of
certain materials, substances and waste into the environment, and various other
health and safety matters. Governmental
authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and
violators may be subject to fines, injunctions or both. The Company must devote substantial financial
resources to ensure compliance, and it believes that it is in substantial
compliance with all the applicable laws and regulations. Certain licenses, permits and product registrations are required for
the Companys products and operations in the United States, Mexico and other
countries in which it does business. The
licenses, permits and product registrations are subject to revocation,
modification and renewal by governmental authorities. In the United States in particular, producers
and distributors of chemicals such as penta, creosote, tetrachlorvinphos and
MSMA are subject to registration and notification requirements under 38 federal law including under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act FIFRA, and comparable state law in order to sell those products
in the United States. Compliance with
these requirements has had, and in the future will continue to have, a material
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company incurred expenses in connection with the FIFRA research and
testing programs of approximately $861,000, $704,700 and $520,000 in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. These costs are
included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Company intends to
expense such costs as incurred. Lawsuits
- - The Company may become a party in routine legal actions or proceedings in the
normal course of its business.
Management does not believe that the outcome of any of these routine
matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During 1991, the Company entered into split-dollar insurance plans
with two officers/stockholders. Each of
those arrangements have now been terminated, but the Company has advanced funds
in prior years for insurance premiums and recorded the advances as a
non-current asset. While the plans were
in effect, the Company had a security interest in the insurance policies to the
extent of the advances. In fiscal 1998,
the arrangement with one such officer was terminated under the provisions of a
five-year employment agreement and converted to a non-interest-bearing
promissory note. Since that time, the
employee has ceased serving as an officer of the Company, but has continued as
an employee. As a portion of the
employees compensation under the employment agreement, the Company is
amortizing the note to compensation expense over a five-year period beginning January1,
2000. The amortization was $34,180 52,034 and $74,023 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In fiscal 2004, the Company
terminated the split dollar insurance plan with the other
officer/stockholder. He transferred his
interest in the insurance policy on his life to the Company for $91,338, the
difference between the cash value of the policy and the premiums paid by the
Company under the terminated plan. 11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company has a defined contribution 401k plan covering
substantially all of its U.S. employees.
The participants may contribute from 3% to 15% of their compensation,
and the Company makes matching contributions under this plan up to 3% of the
participants compensation. Company
contributions to the plan totaled approximately $38,000, $34,000 and $31,000 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In July2001, the Company adopted a supplemental executive
retirement plan. Only persons
specifically designated by the company may be participants in the plan. The plan is unfunded and amounts payable to
participants are general obligations of the company. The plan provides that a participant will be
paid a supplemental retirement benefit for 10 years equal to a percentage of
the participants three-year average base salary at normal retirement. The benefit payable to participants is reduced
by the equivalent actuarial value of the Companys other pension plan payments
to the participant, if any, the Companys 401k plan and one-half social
security benefits. Normal retirement is
the earlier of age 65 and completion of 10 years credited service or age 60
with 30 years credited service. One
executive was designated as a participant in August2001, which resulted
in $57,184, $52,088 and $47,164 of expenses for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. As of July31,2004,
and 2003, the liability under this plan was $156,436 and $99,252, respectively. 39 12. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS The Company had only one customer to whom sales as a percentage of
total sales was 10% or more in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002. Sales to one customer were 14% of total sales
in fiscal 2004, and sales to another customer were 18% and 19% of total sales
in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. 13. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Plan on October15,
1996 and reserved 700,000 shares of its common stock for issuance under the
Stock Plan. The Plan was amended in August2003,
and the maximum shares that may be granted under the Plan was increased to
1,070,000 shares. The Stock Plan
provides for the grant of incentive stock options, as defined in Section422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock
options. The Stock Plan is administered
either by the Companys Board of Directors or by a committee of two or more
non-employee directors. Subject to the
terms of the Stock Plan, the Board of Directors or the committee has the
authority to grant options under the Stock Plan, to amend, construe, and
interpret it, and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions
necessary or advisable for its administration.
The directors, consultants, and key employees of the Company or any
subsidiary are eligible to receive nonqualified options under the Plan, but
only salaried employees of the Company or its subsidiaries are eligible to
receive incentive stock options. Options are exercisable during the period specified in each option
agreement and in accordance with a vesting scheduledesignated by the
Board of Directors or the committee. Any
option agreement may provide that options become immediately exercisable in the
event of a change or threatened change in control of the Company and in the
event of certain mergers and reorganizations of the Company. Options may be subject to early termination
within a designated period following the option holders cessation of service
with the Company. In fiscal 2000, the Company granted a warrant for the purchase of
25,000 shares of the Companys common stock to Gilman Financial Corporation, a
company that employs a Director of the Company, for assistance in developing,
studying, and evaluating merger and acquisition proposals. The warrant is immediately exercisable at a
price of $500 per share of common stock through March6, 2009. Options issued under the Companys Stock Plan in 2004, 2003 and 2002

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The
term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15e and
15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This term refers to the controls and
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
annual report Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. There
were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during our
last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonable likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
