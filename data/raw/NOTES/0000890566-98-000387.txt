REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Coach USA, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coach USA, Inc.
a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Coach
USA, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

1.  BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION
In September 1995, Coach USA, Inc. Coach USA, was founded to create a
national company providing motorcoach transportation services, including charter
and tour services, and related passenger ground transportation services.
In May 1996, Coach USA acquired, simultaneous with the closing of its
initial public offering the Offering, six established businesses.
Consideration for these businesses consisted of a combination of cash and common
stock of Coach USA the Common Stock. These six businesses are referred to
herein as the Founding Companies. Subsequent to the Offering, Coach USA
acquired forty-five additional businesses through December 31, 1997 See Note
3. The acquisition of nineteen of these businesses has been accounted for under
the poolings-of-interests method of accounting the Pooled Companies, three
of these businesses have been accounted for as immaterial poolings-of-interests
the Immaterial Pooled Companies, and twenty-three of these businesses have
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting the Purchased
Companies.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Coach USA and the Founding Companies from June 1, 1996, the effective date used
to account for the acquisitions of the Founding Companies, the Purchased
Companies since their respective dates of acquisition, and give retroactive
effect to the acquisitions of the Pooled Companies. The Pooled Companies, the
Founding Companies subsequent to May 31, 1996, the Immaterial Pooled Companies
from the beginning of the fiscal quarter in which they were acquired, and the
Purchased Companies since date of acquisition, are collectively referred to
herein as the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated for all periods presented. Certain reclassifications have
been made to the Consolidated Financial Statements to conform with the
presentation used in 1997.
Three of the Pooled Companies previously reported on an October fiscal year
end. As such, the accounts of these companies for their 1995 fiscal year have
been consolidated with the accounts of the Company as of December 31, 1995.
Unaudited revenues and net income for these three companies for the two-month
period ended December 31, 1995, were approximately $6,904,000 and $70,000,
respectively. Accordingly, an adjustment is included in the consolidated
statement of stockholders' equity for the net income attributed to this
two-month period.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

COACH USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
INVENTORIES
Inventories consist of motorcoach and taxicab replacement parts and
taxicabs held for sale. Inventory cost for replacement parts is accounted for on
the first-in, first-out basis and inventory cost for taxicabs held for sale or
on short-term leases are accounted for on the specific identification basis, and
both are reported at the lower of cost or market. Taxicabs held for sale are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives of three to five years.
Depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements includes $2,497,000, $2,995,000 and $3,420,000 of depreciation
related to taxicabs held for sale in 1995, 1996 and 1997.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
Notes receivable result from the sale of taxicabs to independent
contractors. The notes bear interest and are due in weekly installments over
periods ranging up to 42 months. Management estimates that the fair value of the
notes receivable approximates the historical value of $130 million at December
31, 1997.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance
and repairs, including replacement of engines and certain other significant
costs, are expensed as costs are incurred.
Depreciation on transportation equipment and other assets, for financial
reporting purposes, is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, net of their estimated residual values. Gains or
losses on the sale of equipment are included in operating expenses.
GOODWILL
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate price paid by the Company
in acquisitions of businesses accounted for as purchases over the fair market
value of the net tangible assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized using the
straight-line method over a period of 40 years. Goodwill on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets is presented net of accumulated amortization of
$377,000 and $2,779,000 as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
OTHER ASSETS
Taxicab permits are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. The
permit costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 40
years. Annual renewal fees are charged to expense as incurred. Also included in
other assets are deferred financing costs, primarily related to the Company
senior subordinated notes. These costs are being amortized using the
straight-line method over the life of the related financing.
The Company applies Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of. Management continually evaluates whether events or
circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining estimated useful
lives of property and equipment, other identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be
recoverable.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company provides services to a broad range of geographical regions. The
Company credit risk primarily consists of receivables from a variety of
customers, including tourism-based companies, governmental units and casinos. In
addition, the Company accounts and notes receivable include amounts due from
independent taxicab contractors. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers and independent taxicab contractors and provides allowances as
deemed necessary.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from recreation, excursion, commuter,
transit and taxicab support services and sales to independent taxicab
contractors when such services and sales are performed. The Company recognizes
financing income on notes receivable using the effective interest method over
the term of the notes. Costs associated with the revenues are recorded as
services and sales are performed.
INCOME TAXES
The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated return for
federal income tax purposes. Acquired companies file short-period federal
income tax returns through their respective acquisition dates and thereafter are
included in the Company consolidated return. For purposes of preparing these
consolidated financial statements, federal and state income taxes have been
provided for certain acquired companies which were Subchapter S corporations
prior to their acquisition by the Company as if these companies had filed
corporate tax returns. Income taxes are provided under the liability method
considering the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements
which are different from the tax return. The deferred income tax assets and
liabilities represent the future tax consequences of those differences, which
will either be taxable or deductible when the underlying assets or liabilities
are recovered or settled.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company Canadian subsidiaries maintain their books and records in
Canadian dollars. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of each accounting
period, and income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange
rate prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from such
translation are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies are reported in other income
and are not significant.
3.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  POOLINGS
During 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of six
companies in exchange for 3,284,336 shares of Common Stock. Five of these
companies provide motorcoach transportation services and one provides taxicab
and luxury sedan services. During 1997, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding stock of sixteen companies in exchange for 3,899,982 shares of
Common Stock. Thirteen of these companies provide motorcoach and other passenger
ground transportation services and three provide taxicab and luxury sedan

The historical financial statements for 1995 and 1996 include the
operations of the Pooled Companies prior to their acquisition by the Company.

PURCHASES
During 1996, the Company acquired the businesses of three motorcoach
companies in transactions accounted for as purchases. The aggregate
consideration paid in these transactions was $168 million in cash, net of cash
acquired, and $225 million in the form of subordinated notes convertible into
750,460 shares of Common Stock. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 1996 includes allocations of the respective purchase prices. The
allocations resulted in goodwill recognized of $365 million representing the
excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
During 1996, prior to merging with the Company, two of the Pooled Companies
completed acquisitions of businesses which were accounted for as purchase
transactions. The aggregate consideration paid in these transactions was $41
million in cash, net of cash acquired.
During 1997, the Company acquired the businesses of twenty companies in
transactions accounted for as purchases. Nineteen of these businesses provide
motorcoach transportation services and one provides taxicab services. The
aggregate consideration paid in these transactions was $646 million in cash,
net of cash acquired, 595,364 shares of the Company Common Stock and $338
million in subordinated notes convertible into 905,258 shares of Common Stock.
The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1997 includes
preliminary allocations of the respective purchase prices and is subject to
final adjustment. The allocations resulted in goodwill recognized of $1094
million representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net
assets acquired.

REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT
In August 1997, the Company amended and restated its credit agreement. The
credit agreement, as amended and restated, provides for a revolving credit
facility of $300 million through a bank syndicate and allows for an additional
$80 million of debt outside the credit facility in addition to fully
subordinated debt. The proceeds of the facility are to be used for working
capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, including refinancing of
indebtedness related to acquisitions. The facility is secured by substantially
all of the assets of the Company and matures in August 2000, at which time all
amounts then outstanding become due. Interest on outstanding borrowings is
charged, at the Company option, at the bank prime rate plus up to 025%, or
the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 050% to 175%, both as
determined by the ratio of the Company funded debt to cash flow, as defined. A
commitment fee is payable on the unused portion of the facility. Under the terms
of the credit agreement, the Company must maintain certain minimum financial
ratios. The credit agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had a total of $1708 million outstanding under
the revolving and other outside credit facilities and had utilized $168 million
of the facility for letters of credit securing certain insurance obligations and
performance bonds, resulting in a borrowing availability of $1924 million under
the revolving and other outside credit facilities.
SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES
In June 1997, the Company completed the sale of $1500 million of 9 3/8%
senior subordinated notes due 2007. The net proceeds from the offering were used
to repay amounts owed under the credit facility. These notes are subordinated to
all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Company, including amounts
outstanding under the Company credit facility, and are guaranteed by the
domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The notes are redeemable at the option of
the Company at prices decreasing from a premium of 1047% on July 1, 2002, to
par on July 1, 2005. Interest on the notes is paid semiannually.
CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES
During 1996 and 1997, the Company issued $563 million of convertible
subordinated notes to certain former owners of the Purchased Companies as
partial consideration of the acquisition purchase price. The notes bear interest
at a weighted average interest rate of 515% and are convertible by the
42
COACH USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
holder into shares of the Company Common Stock at a weighted average price of
$3483 per share. The notes are redeemable for cash or the Company Common
Stock at the option of the Company at any time after one year of issuance. The
terms of the notes require $306 million of principal payments in 1999 and $217
million in 2000. The Company made scheduled principal payments of $40 million
during 1997. Interest on the notes is paid quarterly.
Management estimates that the fair value of its debt obligations
approximates the historical value of $3731 million at December 31, 1997. 9.  INCOME TAXES   The Company has implemented SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,

of the Company. The net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various
dates through 2011. The Company also has tax credit carryforwards which have
been partially offset by a valuation allowance. Certain tax credit carryforwards
will expire at various periods through 2002. In connection with the acquisition
of the Pooled Companies, ownership changes occurred resulting in various
limitations on certain tax attributes of the Pooled Companies. However, the
Company expects full utilization of these tax attributes prior to their
expiration. The effect of differences in foreign versus domestic tax rates is
not material for the periods presented.

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  PURCHASE COMMITMENTS
As of December 31, 1997, the Company had entered into commitments to
purchase 107 motorcoaches for approximately $324 million. The Company intends
to finance these equipment purchases primarily through cash flows from
operations, trade-ins of older equipment and borrowings under the revolving and
other outside credit facilities.
LEASES
The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable
operating leases. Rental expense for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and
1997 was $6,089,000, $9,951,000, and $16,222,000, respectively. Concurrent with
the acquisitions of certain Founding and Purchased Companies, the Company
entered into various agreements with previous owners to lease land and buildings
used in the Company operations. The terms of these leases range through
October 2030 and provide for certain escalations in the rent expense each year.
Included in the 1997 rental expense above is approximately $828,000 of rent paid
to these related parties. The following represents future minimum rental
payments under noncancelable operating leases in thousands   Year ending December 31       11,275

CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS
The Company is subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal
course of business, most of which involve claims for personal injury and
property damage incurred in connection with its operations. The Company
maintains various insurance coverages in order to minimize financial risk
associated with the claims. The Company has provided accruals for certain of
these actions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the
opinion of management, uninsured losses, if any, resulting from the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
REGULATORY MATTERS
The Surface Transportation Board STB must approve or exempt any
consolidation or merger of two or more regulated interstate motorcoach operators
or the acquisition of one such operator by another. As of March 16, 1998, the
STB had exempted from regulatory approval requirements each of the acquisition
transactions involving federally-regulated interstate motorcoach operators
entered into by the Company through October 1997. There can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to obtain such approval or exemption with respect to
acquisitions completed after October 1997 or future acquisitions.
45
COACH USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
ESTIMATED INSURANCE CLAIMS PAYABLE
The primary risks in the Company operations are bodily injury and
property damage to third parties and workers' compensation. The Company has
commercial liability insurance policies that provide coverage by the insurance
company, subject to deductibles ranging from $5,000 to $250,000. The Company is
consolidating its insurance coverages under a program which provides for
deductibles ranging from $100,000 to $250,000. As such, any claim within the
deductible per incident would be the financial obligation of the Company.
The accrued insurance claims payable represents management estimate of
the Company potential claims costs in satisfying the deductible provisions of
the insurance policies for claims occurring through December 31, 1997. The
accrual is based on known facts and historical trends. Management believes such
accrual to be adequate.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company maintains certain 401k plans which allow eligible employees
to defer a portion of their income through contributions to the plans. The
Company contributed $303,000, $301,000 and $455,000 to these plans during the
years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS
The Company is a party to various collective bargaining agreements with
certain of its employees. The agreements require the Company to pay specified
wages and provide certain benefits to its union employees. These agreements will
expire at various times through 2002. 11. NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Earnings per share amounts are based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the
period. The weighted average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted

13.     EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN
The Company 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting
of options to key employees to purchase an aggregate of not more than the
greater of 1,500,000 shares or 15% of the total number of shares of the
Company Common Stock outstanding at the time of grant at fair market value on
the date of grant. One-fifth of granted options generally become exercisable
after one year, and continue to become exercisable in one-fifth increments each
year thereafter. The options expire after ten years from the date of grant if
unexercised. Outstanding options may be canceled and reissued under terms
specified in the plan.
The following table summarizes activity under the Company stock
option plan as of December 31, 1996 and 1997 in thousands, except per share

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation under Accounting
Principles Board Statement No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under this accounting method, no compensation expense is recognized in the
consolidated statements of income if no intrinsic value of the option exists at
the date of grant. In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS
51
COACH USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS No. 123 encourages
companies to account for stock based compensation awards based on the fair value
of the awards at the date they are granted. The resulting compensation cost
would be shown as an expense in the statement of income. Companies can choose
not to apply the new accounting method and continue to apply current accounting
requirements; however, disclosure is required as to what net income and earnings
per share would have been had the new accounting method been followed. While the
Company did not adopt SFAS No. 123 for accounting purposes, it has implemented
the disclosure requirements below which include annual pro forma disclosures of
its effects on options granted since the initial grant in May 1996. Had
compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123,
the Company net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
following pro forma amounts in thousands, except per share data                              1996      1997
Net Earnings        As reported. $ 16,788    $ 31,408

Diluted Earnings Per Share As reported. $  112    $  142
Pro forma. $  102    $  128
The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in the pro forma disclosure may not
be indicative of future amounts as additional awards in future years are
anticipated. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
assumptions for 1996 and 1997: i risk-free interest rates ranging from 573%
to 696%, ii expected life of 10 years in 1996 and 6 years in 1997, iii
average volatility of 35%, and iv dividend yield of 000%. 14.   EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS
During 1996, obligations due to stockholders of a Pooled Company of
$172 million were retired in exchange for shares of Coach USA Common Stock. The
transactions resulted in an extraordinary gain on early extinguishment of debt
of approximately $42 million, net of taxes, representing the excess of the
recorded value of the obligations exchanged over the market value of the Coach
USA Common Stock. This gain was partially offset by extraordinary losses of
approximately $16 million, net of taxes, resulting from early extinguishment of
debt at certain other companies.
The extraordinary items recorded in 1997 include extraordinary losses of
$09 million, net of taxes, related to prepayment penalties from the early
extinguishment of debt at certain companies. 15.   QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED
The table below sets forth the unaudited consolidated operating results
by quarter for the year ended December 31, 1997. All quarters presented have
been restated for subsequent acquisitions accounted for as
poolings-of-interests, except for the Immaterial Pooled Companies in thousands,
except per share data.

accompanying consolidated statements of income.
16.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED
Through March 16, 1998, the Company acquired seven additional businesses
subsequent to December 31, 1997. These subsequent acquisitions were accounted
for as purchases. The aggregate consideration paid in these transactions was
$163 million in cash, $49 million of subordinated notes convertible into
122,000 shares of the Company Common Stock, and 242,000 shares of the
Company Common Stock.
Subsequent to year end, the Company entered into a swap agreement which
effectively fixes the price the Company will pay for a significant portion of
diesel fuel purchases, the primary fuel consumed in the Company operations.
The swap agreement utilizes NYMEX No. 2 heating oil, which has a high degree of
correlation to diesel fuel. Under the swap agreement, the Company purchased a
notional quantity of 30 million gallons per month at prices ranging from
$04825 per gallon to $05215 per gallon from March 1 through December 31, 1998.
This notional quantity represents an amount less than the Company anticipated
average monthly consumption. The swap agreement will be accounted for on a
monthly settlement basis with the net amounts paid or received under the
agreement included in the cost of the commodity. The use of such a commodity
swap effectively protects the Company against an increase in the price of the
commodity or prevents the Company from benefitting in the event of a decrease in
the price of the commodity, to the extent of the notional quantity under
contract.
