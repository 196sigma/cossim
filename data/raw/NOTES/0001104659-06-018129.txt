8. FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of BioSphere Medical,Inc. and subsidiaries We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioSphere Medical,Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive
income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2005. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purposes
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of BioSphere Medical,Inc.
and subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated
results of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2005 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ANature of the Business
BioSphere Medical,Inc. the Company was
incorporated in Delaware in December1993. The Company is focused on
applying its proprietary EmbosphereMicrospheres and other ancillary embolotherapy
products for use in treating uterine fibroids, hypervascularized tumors and
arteriovenous malformations. The Companys wholly owned subsidiary, Biosphere
Medical S.A. BMSA, a French socit anonyme, holds the license to the
embolotherapy technology that is the main focus of the Companys business.
The Company believes that
its existing working capital as of December31, 2005, together with
anticipated proceeds from sales of microspheres, delivery systems and other
products, together with the proceeds from our placement of 2,075,000 shares of
common stock, which was completed on February22, 2006 see Note Q will
be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements, as currently planned
through 2007. In the longer term the Company expects to fund its operations and
sustaining capital requirements through a combination of expected proceeds from
product sales and capital equipment financing. However, cash requirements may
vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors, including,
without limitation, the Companys failure to achieve expected revenue amounts,
costs associated with changes in its uterine fibroid embolization UFE
marketing programs, anticipated research and development expenses, the scope
and results of pre-clinical and clinical testing, changes in the focus and
direction of research and development programs, competitive and technological
advances, the timing and results of regulatory review at the United States Food
and Drug Administration FDA or comparable regulatory agencies in other
countries and the markets acceptance of any approved products, including
Embosphere Microspheres for UFE and HepaSphere Microspheres.
BSummary
of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries BMSA, Biosphere Medical Japan,Inc. and BSMD
Ventures,Inc. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Translation of Foreign Currencies
The functional currency of
each of the Companys foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. The assets
and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rates in effect as of each balance sheet date.
Revenue and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange
rates prevailing during each reporting period. Resulting translation
adjustments are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in
stockholders equity. Aggregate foreign exchange transaction gains and losses
are included in the accompanying statement of operations for all periods
presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the following: 1the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, 2the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at  53 the date
of the financial statements, and 3the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less, as
of the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. In accordance with the Companys
investment policy, surplus cash is invested in investment grade corporate and
U.S. government debt as well as certain asset-backed securities. At December31,
2004, all marketable securities were classified as available for sale, since
the Company had the intent to use such securities to satisfy current
liabilities as needed. Available-for-sale marketable securities are carried at
their fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in the accompanying balance sheet.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Off-Balance Sheet
Risk
The Company has no
material concentrations of credit risk, nor is it a party to any financial
instruments with material off-balance sheet risk. Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist
primarily of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade accounts
receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt obligations. The estimated fair
value of the Companys financial instruments approximates their carrying value.
The Company places its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with
high credit quality financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of
customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. No single customer
accounted for greater than 10% of the outstanding receivables on December31,
2005 or 2004, and no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenues
in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts
Trade accounts receivable
are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for
doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable
credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the
allowance based on age of receivables and on historical write-off experience by
location. The Company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. Past
due balances over 90 days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually
for collectibility. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when
the Company feels it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The
Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its
customers.
Property and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation based
upon expected useful lives using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives 
Office equipment
3-5 years
Laboratory and manufacturing equipment
3-5 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or estimated usefullife
Maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of
disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to the statement
of operations. 54 Goodwill and Other Assets
Goodwill represents the difference between the
purchase price and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible
net assets acquired when accounted for in accordance with the purchase method
of accounting. Between February1999 and November2001, the Company
recorded goodwill upon the periodic step-acquisitions of BMSA.
The Company performs
annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. Goodwill was derived from the step
acquisition of BMSA, the consolidated subsidiary that holds the license to the
embolotherapy platform device that is the main focus of the Companys business.
Accordingly, impairment measurements are based upon the discounted cash flows
of BMSA statutory profitability and anticipated worldwide sales of the Companys
microspheres. Based upon the Companys review, the Company has not recorded any
impairment charges.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company periodically
evaluates the potential impairment of its long-lived assets in accordance with
SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, to
determine whether events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the
carrying amount of a recorded asset may not be recoverable. Based on managements
assessment as of December31, 2005, the Company has determined that no
impairment of long-lived assets exists.
Revenue Recognition
The Company complies with the revenue recognition
guidelines summarized in Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue
Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the
customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant
receivable is reasonably assured, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
a valid purchase order from an approved customer, and the sales price is
fixed or determinable. Revenue from licensing agreements is recognized ratably
over the period of the related agreement. The Company establishes reserves for
potential sales returns and evaluates, the adequacy of those reserves based
upon realized experience. Under the Companys current policy, only those
products on a customers initial order qualify for product satisfaction-related
credit returns. To date, returns related to product satisfaction have been
minimal and immaterial. While such returns have historically been within the
Companys expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot
guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has
in the past. Any significant change in product satisfaction and any resulting
credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the Companys operating
results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize. Shipping
and handling costs are included in costs of product sales.
In June2004, the
Company entered into an exclusive five-month development agreement with a third
party for the use of Embosphere Microspheres for gastroesophegal reflex
disease, or GERD. In exchange for this agreement, the Company received a
payment of $100,000. Based upon the application of the revenue recognition
policies and all related judgments and estimates, the Company recognized
$100,000 as licensing revenue over the life of the contract, which concluded in
November2004.
Research and Development
Research and development
costs, including product validation costs under FDA Good Manufacturing
Practices, are expensed in the period incurred. 55 Deferred Taxes
The Company uses the asset
and liability accounting method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statements and
tax bases of assets and liabilities using current statutory tax rates. A
valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if, based on
the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management evaluates, on a quarterly
basis, the ability to recover the deferred tax assets and the level of the
valuation allowance. Due to the size of the net operating loss carry forward in
relation to the Companys history of unprofitable operations, the Company has
not recognized any of its net deferred tax assets. However, future improvements
in operational performance could result in the increased certainty of the
ability to apply deferred tax assets against taxable income, which could, in
turn, result in a significant impact on the value of the Companys deferred tax
assets and reported operating results.
Comprehensive Income/Loss
Comprehensive
income/loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income/loss.
Other comprehensive income/loss includes certain changes in equity that are
excluded from net loss, specifically, the effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale
securities, which are reflected separately in stockholders equity in
accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. The components of accumulated
other comprehensive income/loss are as follows

convertible securities. Shares used to compute dilutive net loss per share
exclude common share equivalents as their inclusion would have an antidilutive
effect.

Stock Options
The Company applies the principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock incentive plans. Under APB No25, compensation
expense is measured as the difference, if any, between the option exercise
price and the fair value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant.
The Company has historically granted options to employees and directors at
exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Companys  56 common stock. Accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized for its employee stock-based
compensation plans.
SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
as amended, establishes a fair value based approach for valuing stock options.
The Company follows the disclosure-only alternative afforded by SFAS No123.
Had compensation expense for stock options issued to employees and directors
been determined based on the estimated fair value at the grant dates as
calculated in accordance with SFAS No123, the Companys reported net
loss and basic and diluted net loss per common share for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated
below

Stock-Based Compensation to Non-Employees
The Company accounts for
stock-based compensation to non-employees using the fair value method
prescribed by SFAS No123. As a result of stock options issued to
non-employee medical board advisors, the Company recognized $39,000 in
non-employee compensation expense during the year ended December31, 2003.
The fair value of the non-employee stock options was derived from the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications
have been made to prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to
the current year presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In December2004, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment as revised, SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R addresses the accounting for
transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for aequity
instruments of the enterprise, or bliabilities that are based on the
fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the
issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 and requires
that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method. SFAS
123R requires companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related
to share-based payment arrangements, including  57 stock option and employee
stock purchase plans. In April2005, the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC announced the adoption of a new rulethat amends the
compliance dates for SFAS 123R. The new ruleof the SEC requires companies
to implement SFAS 123R at the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins
after June15, 2005. Accordingly, the Company adopted SFAS 123R as of January1,
2006. The Company expects to use the modified-prospective transition method and
will not restate prior periods for the adoption of SFAS 123R.
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 SFAS 123, the Company currently accounts for
share-based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as
such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of
SFAS123Rfair value method will have a significant impact on the
Companys result of operations, although it will have no impact on its overall
financial position and cash position. The impact of adoption of SFAS123R
cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of
share-based payments granted in the future, expected volatilities and expected
useful lives, among other factors, present at the grant date. However, based on
the Companys current assumptions the adoption of SFAS123R is expected to
increase compensation costs by approximately $130 million in 2006.
In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151,
Inventory Costsan amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No43,
Chapter 4 SFAS 151. SFAS 151 is the result of a broader effort by the FASB
to improve the comparability of cross-border financial reporting by working
with the International Accounting Standards Board IASB toward development
of a single set of high quality accounting standards. The FASB and the IASB
noted that both ARB No43, Chapter 4 and International Accounting
Standard IAS No2, Inventories, require that abnormal amounts of
idle freight, handling costs, and wasted materials be recognized as period
costs; however, the FASB and the IASB noted that differences in the wording of
the two standards could lead to inconsistent application of those similar
requirements. The FASB concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in
ARB No43 by adopting language similar to that used in IAS No2 is
consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the United States
and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally. Adoption of
SFAS 151 is required for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005;
accordingly, the Company will adopt SFAS 151 as of January1, 2006. The
provisions of SFAS 151 will be applied prospectively. The Company is currently
in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS 151, but does not believe it
will have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position
of the Company. 58 CGoodwill

credit facility expires in June2007. There were no borrowings outstanding
under this agreement as of December31, 2005 or 2004. Each available 30 60-, 90- or 180- day advance will bear interest at a per
annum rate, at the Companys option, equal to either ia variable rate
as determined by the bank or iia rate equal to the corresponding 30 60-, 90- or 180-day LIBOR rate 44% as of December31,
2005 plus a LIBOR advance rate spread as determined by certain current working
capital balances at the time of the advance. In connection with the credit
facility, the Company entered into a security agreement pursuant to which the
Company has pledged to the bank all of the Companys U.S. assets, excluding our
equity ownership of our subsidiaries including BMSA, as collateral. Letters of
credit issued in the ordinary course of business totaled $453,000 as of December31,

JIncome Taxes
As of
December31, 2005, the Company had federal net operating loss NOL
carry forwards of approximately $6750 million, which will expire through the
year 2025, state NOL carry forwards of approximately $4256 million, which will
expire through the year 2010, and foreign NOL carry forwards of approximately
$370 million, which do not expire. As of December31, 2005, the Company
has $189,000 of research and development credit carry forwards to offset future
income taxes, which will expire through the year 2017. The components of the
Companys net deferred tax asset at December31, 2005 and 2004 are as

The Company has established a full valuation allowance
against its deferred tax assets as of December31, 2005 as it considers
the realizable value of any tax benefit against future taxable income to be
uncertain. The change in the valuation allowance from December31, 2004 to
December31, 2005 is a result of the increase in NOL carry forwards and
deferred compensation.
The 2005 income tax benefit of $93,000 primarily
represents the realization of income tax benefits, as a portion of the 2001
taxes paid in France were recovered.
The 2004 income tax provision of $117,000 primarily
represents the reversal of income tax benefits recorded during 2002 as
management determined in the fourth quarter of 2004 that a portion of the 2001
taxes paid would not be recovered. For the years ended December31, 2005,
2004, and 2003, the increase in the valuation allowance relating to losses not
resulting in a current period tax benefit is the primary difference between the
income tax provision benefit recorded by the Company and what the income tax
benefit would be at statutory income tax rates. 62 The
components of the Companys pre-tax loss by tax jurisdiction, net of any
intercompany transactions, are as follows

PContingencies
On August17, 2005, a
lawsuit commenced in the Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit,
St.Louis, Missouri captioned Brett
Pingel by next friend Dawn LaRose vs. BioSphere Medical,Inc., Bruce Kirke
Bieneman, M.D., St. Louis University Hospital, John Stith, M.D. and St. Louis
University. The lawsuit alleges, among other things, that a patient
suffered permanent bilateral blindness as a result of the use of the Companys
Embosphere Microspheres in a juvenile nasal angiofibroma embolization or the
negligence of the healthcare providers or both factors combined. All defendants
have denied the allegations against them. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and
punitive damages. The Company carries product liability insurance and this case
is currently being defended by the Companys insurer under reservation of
rights with respect to the claim of punitive damages, for which an exclusion
from coverage exists. The Company has filed an answer to this lawsuit in which
it has denied the claims being made. The Company believes that this lawsuit is
without merit and that it has viable defenses to the allegations in the
complaint. Accordingly, the Company intends to defend against the claims
vigorously. However, the Company cannot
give any assurance that it will prevail and it is currently unable to predict
the impact, financial or otherwise, of this product liability litigation. 66 QSubsequent Events
On February22, 2006, the Company sold 2,075,000
shares of the Companys common stock at a per share price of $700 to several
investors in a private placement. Net proceeds to the Company were
approximately $1340 million.
On February24, 2006,
the Company amended the lease for the Rockland, Massachusetts facility
increasing the total area of leased space to approximately 13,000 square feet
at a monthly cost of $19,500 per month, and extending the term of the lease
through February28, 2009.

STAFF COMMENTS
None. 31 Item 2. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES
Our management, with the
participation of the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as of December31, 2005. The term disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eunder
the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SECs rulesand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys
management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31,
2005, the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer
concluded that, as of such date, the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
No change in our internal control over financial
reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2005 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
