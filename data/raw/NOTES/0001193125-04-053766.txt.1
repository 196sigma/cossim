Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  Board of Directors Transgenomic, Inc. Omaha, Nebraska  We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Transgenomic, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Transgenomic, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As discussed in Note R, during the first quarter of 2004, the Company
obtained a waiver of the borrowing base limit on its existing line of credit and entered into a convertible note agreement. As discussed in Note A, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in
connection with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  Omaha, Nebraska March 26, 2004

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001  Tabular amounts in thousands except share and per share data  A.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Business Description.  Transgenomic, Inc., a
Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries the Company provide innovative products and services for the synthesis, purification and analysis of nucleic acids. The Companys products and services include automated instrument
systems, associated consumables, nucleic acid chemical building blocks, nucleic acid synthesis products, novel chemistry development for nucleic acids, process development services and genetic variation discovery services. The Company develops,
assembles, manufactures and markets its products and services to the life sciences industry to be used in research focused on molecular genetics of humans and other organisms. Such research could lead to development of new diagnostics and
therapeutics. The Companys business plan is to participate in the value chain associated with these activities by providing key technology, tools, consumables, biochemical reagents and services to those entities engaged in basic biomedical
research and the development of diagnostics and therapeutic agents.  Prior to 2002 the Company was managed and operated on a fully integrated basis in one operating segment. During 2002, management determined it was appropriate to evaluate the Companys operations based upon the nature of the products
and services provided. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in two reportable segments, BioSystems and Nucleic Acids. The BioSystems operating segment generates revenue from the sale of automated instrument systems and associated
consumable products and services. The Nucleic Acids operating segment generates revenue from the sale of nucleic acid-based products and services.  The Company markets and sells these products primarily through a direct sales and support group in North America and Europe and through a network of
distributors in the Pacific Rim and other international markets. These sales efforts are directed from the Company headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska and through a series of sales and support offices strategically located throughout the United States,
Europe and Japan.  Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Transgenomic,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Cash and Cash Equivalents.  For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and temporary investments with original maturities at acquisition of three
months or less.  Short Term Investments.  The Company classifies all of its short-term investments with maturities at
acquisition of greater than three months as available for sale securities. Such short term investments consist primarily of United States government and federal agency securities, corporate commercial paper and corporate debt which are stated at
market value, with unrealized gains and losses on such securities reflected, net of tax, as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on short term investments are included in earnings and are derived using
the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities. It is the Companys intent to maintain a liquid portfolio to take advantage of investment opportunities; therefore, all securities are considered to be available for
sale and are classified as current assets. The Company may from time to time accept common stock from its customers as payment. These shares may be classified as trading securities with changes in fair value being recognized in current income or
loss.

Accounts Receivable. 
Accounts receivable are shown net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $549,000 and $450,000 in 2003 and 2002, respectively. Payment terms generally
are 30 or 60 days. The Company has also provided extended payment terms of up to 90 days to some of its customers.  Inventories.  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard costs for finished goods and average or latest actual cost for raw
materials and work in process.  Property and Equipment.  Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed by the straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:  Buildings
15 years
Leasehold improvements
3 to 7 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 to 7 years
Production equipment
5 to 7 years
Computer equipment

Goodwill and other Intangible
Assets  The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, beginning on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized, but will be tested for
impairment annually. Impairment occurs when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If impaired, the assets carrying value is reduced to its fair value. The Company completes its annual impairment test during the fourth
quarter. Identifiable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Impairment occurs
when the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value.  Other
Assets.  Other assets include patents, intellectual
property, deferred financing costs and capitalized software development costs. The Company capitalizes the external and in-house legal costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on its new discoveries and amortizes these costs using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life, generally 17 years, beginning on the date the patent is issued. The Company capitalized software development costs for products offered for sale in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. This Standard allows for the capitalization of certain development costs once a
software product has reached technological feasibility.

Stock Based Compensation.  The Company accounts for its employee stock option grants under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which utilizes the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the deemed fair market value of the Companys common stock at
the date of grant over the stock option exercise price. Stock option grants to nonemployees are accounted for using the fair value method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation using the Black-Scholes model.  The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock based employee
compensation.  2003 2002 2001 Net Loss As reported 22,958 21,365 7,401 Pro forma 24,794 23,274 10,110 Basic and diluted loss per share As reported 094 091 033 Pro forma 101 099 045
Income Taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date using tax rates expected to be in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
to the extent that it is unlikely they will be realized.  Revenue
Recognition.  Revenue on the sales of products is
recognized in accordance with the terms of the sales arrangement. Such recognition is based on receipt of an unconditional customer order and transfer of title and risk of ownership to the customer, typically upon shipment of the product. Our sales
terms do not provide for the right of return unless the product is damaged or defective. Revenues from certain services associated with our analytical instruments, to be performed subsequent to shipment of the products, is deferred and recognized
when the services are provided. Such services, mainly limited to installation and training services that are not essential to the functionality of the instruments, typically are performed in a timely manner subsequent to shipment of the instrument.
The Company also enters into various service contracts that cover installed WAVE systems. These contracts cover specific time periods and revenue associated with these contracts is deferred and recognized over the service period. At December 31,
2003 and 2002 deferred revenue, mainly associated with our service contracts, included on the Companys balance sheet was approximately $18 million and $12 million respectively.  Research and Development.  Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred with the exception of certain software development costs that are capitalized.

A.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
Translation of Foreign Currency.  Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the U.S. are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The
adjustments to translate those amounts into U.S. dollars are accumulated in a separate account in stockholders equity and are included in other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from changes in
currency exchange rates are included in the determination of net income. Foreign currency transaction adjustments decreased net loss approximately $10 million in 2003 and 2002. Foreign currency transaction adjustments in 2001 were not significant.
Comprehensive Income.  Comprehensive income for all periods presented consists of net income,
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments. The Company deems its foreign investments to be permanent in nature and does not provide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising
from converting its investments in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. There were no reclassification adjustments to be reported in the periods presented.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The carrying amount of the Companys cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments. The Company derives the fair value of its short-term investments based on quoted market prices. The carrying value of long-term debt and the line of credit approximates fair value based upon existing interest
rates available to the Company for similar debt.  Earnings Per Share.
Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants or conversion of convertible notes, where dilutive. Potentially
dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share as they have an antidilutive effect due to the Companys net loss.  Use of Estimates.  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Reclassifications.  Certain reclassifications
may have been made to the 2002 and 2001 financial statements to conform to the current presentation.

short-term investments are due within one year.  In September
2003, the Company entered into an addendum to an existing supply agreement with Geron Corporation. The addendum allows Geron to pay for products being manufactured under the addendum with Geron common stock. As a result, Geron issued 31,080 shares
of common stock to the Company as a prepayment for products. These shares are being accounted for as available for sale securities.  In June 2003, the Company entered into a license agreement with Geron Corporation. As part of the agreement, the Company was required to purchase 310,000
shares of Geron common stock for $505 per share on June 3, 2003. On June 4, 2003, the Company sold the Geron shares. The purchase and sale of these shares was accounted for as a purchase and sale of trading securities. The purchase price was
$1,565,500 and the sale proceeds were $1,519,000 resulting in a trading loss of $46,500. This loss is reflected in current earnings and cash flows from operations.  C.INVENTORIES  At December 31, 2003 and 2002, inventories consist of the following:  2003

F.LINE OF CREDIT AND LONG-TERM DEBT  In June 2003, the Company entered into a loan agreement with a financial
institution for a secured line of credit up to a maximum of $50 million. In December 2003, the Company terminated the existing line of credit and entered into a new, $75 million line of credit facility with Laurus Master Fund, Ltd.
Laurus, of which the Company borrowed $40 million during 2003. The term of the agreement is three years carrying an interest rate of 20% over the prime rate or a minimum of 60%. Funds available under the line are equal to 90% of
eligible accounts receivable balances plus up to $10 million related to inventory balances. This line of credit is secured by most of the Companys assets. Payment of interest and principal can, under certain circumstances, be made with shares
of the Companys common stock at a fixed conversion price of $220 per share. Conversion of this debt to common stock may be made at the election of Laurus or the Company. The Company may elect to convert only if its shares trade at a price
exceeding $242 per share for ten consecutive trading days and is further subject to trading volume limitations and a limitation on the total beneficial ownership by Laurus of the Companys common stock. In connection with the line of credit
facility, the Company issued warrants to Laurus to acquire 550,000 shares of its common stock at exercise prices that exceed the average trading price of the Companys common stock over the ten trading days prior to execution of the new line of
credit.  Certain features of the line of credit facility
require the Company to separately account for the value of certain amounts related to the warrants issued and the conversion feature of the facility. Specifically, Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 00-27, Application of Issue No.
98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments, requires the Company to value the warrants issued and the beneficial conversion premium related to this convertible facility. The beneficial conversion premium was initially based upon the
Companys borrowings during 2003 of $40 million. Any additional borrowings under the line of credit facility in the future will result in additional beneficial conversion premiums. The value of the warrants and the beneficial conversion
premium are recorded on the balance sheet as a debt discount and an increase to additional paid in capital. The debt discount recorded for these items will be amortized as expense to the income statement over the term of the facility or as the
warrants are exercised or the debt converted into common stock thereby increasing the effective interest rate on the facility. In connection with the conversion of $20 million of debt incurred under the line of credit facility in January and
February 2004, the Company will accelerate the amortization of approximately $240,000 of the beneficial conversion premium.  During 2002, Cruachem Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a mortgage loan with The Royal Bank of Scotland. The original principal
amount of the loan was 10 million. Principal and interest are payable in quarterly installments. The loan carries a 15 year term and a fixed annual interest rate of 677%. Security for this loan is the Companys 45,000 square foot
manufacturing facility located in Glasgow, Scotland. The loan carries certain financial and non-financial covenants that must be met by Cruachem Ltd. that include a minimum net cash flow requirement. The net book value of the facility was
approximately $20 million at December 31, 2003. During February 2004, the Company repaid the principal balance of the mortgage loan and therefore, the Company has included the entire outstanding principal balance at December 31, 2003 within current
liabilities.

H.INCOME TAXES Continued 
The Companys provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
differs from the amounts determined by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate to loss before income taxes for the following reasons:  2003 2002 2001 Benefit at Federal Rate 7,784 7,228 2,508 Increase decrease resulting from State income taxesnet of federal benefit 485 518 154 Foreign subsidiary tax rate difference 427 224 17 Research and development tax credit 250 188 98 Othernet 82 137 345 Valuation allowance 8,075 7,678 2,456 Total income tax expense 65 105 24  The Companys
deferred income tax asset at December 31, 2003 and 2002 is comprised of the following temporary differences:  2003 2002 Net operating loss carryforward 30,480 23,099 Deferred revenue 400 218 Accrued vacation 134 116 Other 422 250 30,592 23,183 Less valuation allowance 30,592 23,183  At December 31, 2003,
the Company has unused federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $18 million which expire in 2008, $37 million which expire in 2009, $30 million which expire in 2010, $09 million which expire in 2011, $34 million which
expire in 2012, $18 million which expire in 2018, $82 million which expire in 2019, $97 million which expire in 2020, $82 million which expire in 2021, $168 million which will expire in 2022 and $210 million which will expire in 2023.
Approximately $118 million of the Companys total federal net operating loss carryforwards were obtained in the acquisition of Annovis, Inc. and may be subject to certain restrictions. Additionally, at December 31, 2003, the Company has unused
state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $287 million. These credits expire at various times between 2008 and 2023. A valuation allowance has been provided in 2003 and 2002 for the remaining deferred tax assets, due to the
Companys cumulative losses in recent years, expected losses in future years and an inability to utilize any additional losses as carrybacks. The Company will continue to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the related
valuation allowance. To the extent the Company begins to generate income in future years and it is determined that such valuation allowance is no longer required, the tax benefit of the remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time.

J.STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  Common Stock Warrants.  During 2002 the Company entered into an operating lease agreement with GE Capital. The agreement included the issuance of 13,762 warrants with an exercise
price of $327 per share and a term of five years expiring in 2007. In 2003 an additional 9,175 warrants with an exercise price of $327 per share and term of 5 years expiring in 2008 were issued to GE Capital in connection with the operating lease.

All warrants issued to GE Capital, Laurus and TN Capital Equities remain outstanding at December 31, 2003.  Preferred Stock.  The Companys Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more
series, from time to time, with such designations, powers, preferences and rights and such qualifications, limitations and restrictions as may be provided in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. The authority of the Board
of Directors includes, but is not limited to, the determination or fixing of the following with respect to shares of such class or any series thereof: i the number of shares; ii the dividend rate, whether dividends shall be cumulative and, if
so, from which date; iii whether shares are to be redeemable and, if so, the terms and amount of any sinking fund providing for the purchase or redemption of such shares; iv whether shares shall be convertible and, if so, the terms and
provisions thereof; v what restrictions are to apply, if any, on the issue or reissue of any additional preferred stock; and vi whether shares have voting rights. The preferred stock may be issued with a preference over the common stock as to
the payment of dividends. The Company has no current plans to issue any series of preferred stock. Classes of stock such as the preferred stock may be used, in certain circumstances, to create voting impediments on extraordinary corporate
transactions or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a merger or otherwise to gain control of the Company. For the foregoing reasons, any preferred stock issued by the Company could have an adverse effect on the rights of the holders of the common
stock.  Common Stock.  In September 2003, the Company issued 1,780,000 shares of our common stock
and in November 2003, the Company issued 2,720,000 shares of our common stock in privately-negotiated sales. These shares were sold pursuant to the terms of a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated August 27, 2003. The sale of these shares was exempt
from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Securities Act as a sale not involving a public offering. These shares have been registered for resale pursuant to a Registration Statement declared effective on
November 14, 2003. The net proceeds to the Company, after payment of transaction fees and other expenses of the offering, were approximately $43 million.

J.STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Continued 
In May 2001, the Company issued 1,889,523 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisition
of Annovis, Inc. See Footnote O for further discussion of this acquisition.  In May 2001, Company shareholders approved the adoption of the Transgenomic, Inc. 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that was subsequently implemented in November 2001. Substantially all of the Companys U.S.
employees are eligible to participate in the Plan. Eligible employees authorize payroll deductions to be made for the purchase of shares. Such deductions are accumulated during a defined participation period at the end of which each participant is
deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of stock from the Company at 85% of the fair market value of the Company stock as measured by the closing price of the stock on either the first or last business day of the participation
period, whichever is lower. The number of shares purchased under the option is based upon the participants elected withholding amount. At the end of the participation period such option is automatically exercised. This plan is structured to qualify
as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. During 2003 and 2002 there were 107,077 and 56,842 shares issued under this plan, respectively. During 2001 there were no shares
issued under this plan.  K.STOCK OPTIONS
The Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended
the Stock Option Plan, allows the Company to grant both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of the Companys common stock to employees and directors of the Company and to nonemployee advisors.
Either incentive or non-qualified stock options may be granted to employees of the Company, but only nonqualified stock options may be granted to nonemployee directors and advisors. The maximum number of shares for which options may be granted under
the Stock Option Plan is 7,000,000. The Stock Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee which has the authority to set the number, exercise price, term and vesting provisions of
the options granted under the Stock Option Plan, subject to the terms thereof. The options must be granted at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Generally, the stock options vest at a
rate of either 20% per year over a five-year period or 33 1/3% per year over a three-year period and expire 10 years after the date the option was granted. If the option holder ceases to be employed by the Company, the
Company will have the right to terminate any outstanding but unexercised options.

The weighted average
fair value per share of options granted in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $093, $292 and $232, respectively.  The Company has elected to follow the measurement provisions of APB No. 25, under which no recognition of expense is required in accounting for stock
options granted to employees for which the exercise price equals or exceeds the deemed fair market value of the stock at the grant date. In those cases where options have been granted with an exercise price below the deemed fair market value, the
Company recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting periods of the individual stock options.  Stock-based compensation expense recorded by the Company represents amortization of unearned compensation related to options granted to employees with an
exercise price less than the deemed fair market value at the date of grant and options granted to non-employees. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded compensation expense of $92,000, $131,000 and $139,000, respectively. The expense
amounts were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: no common stock dividends, risk-free interest rates ranging from 310% to 653%; volatility ranging from 35% to 85%; and an expected option life of
1 to 75 years.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  Prior to 2002 the
Company was managed and operated on a fully integrated basis in one operating segment. During 2002, management determined it was appropriate to evaluate the Companys operations based upon the nature of the products and services provided.
Accordingly, the Company has determined that it operates in two reportable segments, BioSystems and Nucleic Acids. Operations for these segments are evaluated based upon specific identification of revenues and expenses associated with the business
activities resulting in a segment operating income. Expenses that cannot be directly identified to an operating activity or are considered corporate overhead are not allocated to the segments in arriving at operating income for the segment.
Generally, decisions regarding asset allocation, financing, taxes or other items impacting the Companys Balance Sheet are made at the corporate level and, accordingly, operating segment Balance Sheet information is not typically reviewed by
operating decision makers.  The BioSystems operating segment
generates revenue from the sale of automated instrument systems and associated consumable products and services. This segments products are based upon two of the Companys three core competencies, separations chemistries and enzymology.
Specifically, this segments main products are the WAVE system, related bioconsumables and research services.  The Nucleic Acids operating segment generates revenue from the sale of products and services based upon all three of the Companys core competencies,
nucleic acid chemistries, separations chemistries and enzymology. Specifically, this segments main products are nucleic acid building blocks or phosphoramidites, oligonucleotides, fluorescent markers, dyes and associated reagents and
novel chemistry and process development services.

O.ACQUISITION  Effective May 1, 2001, the Company acquired Annovis, Inc, a privately held company, for approximately $169 million through the issuance of approximately 19 million shares of Transgenomic, Inc. common stock, the payment of approximately
$563,000 in cash in lieu of common stock to certain Annovis stockholders and the payment of approximately $32 million of direct acquisition related expenses. The acquisition was structured as a merger of Annovis with a subsidiary of the Company and
resulted in Annovis becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Annovis is a specialty chemicals company that develops, manufactures and markets a wide variety of nucleic acid based products and service for the life sciences industry.
Annoviss results of operations have been included in the accompanying financial statements beginning on May 1, 2001.

Q.CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING  The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from
operations. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2002 management formulated and executed a significant portion of a restructuring plan. The plan was developed to reduce expenses thereby better aligning the Companys expense structure with
current business prospects. The plan included employee terminations, office closures, termination of collaborations and write-offs of abandoned intellectual property. Specifically, in the fourth quarter of 2002 the Company notified approximately 60
employees of their termination, notified landlords of our intent to close four facilities and reduce our space commitment under lease at two other facilities, terminated certain consulting and collaboration agreements and abandoned certain patents.
As a result of the plan $33 million in restructuring charges were recorded and are included in operating expenses. These charges consisted of approximately $800,000 of employee severance costs, $12 million in office closure related costs, $400,000
of collaboration and other agreement termination charges and $900,000 in write-offs of abandoned intellectual property. Approximately 45% of the total charges were for non-cash items. Additional restructuring charges totaling $738,000 were incurred
in the first half of 2003. The Company had accrued expenses associated with the restructuring activities of approximately 227,000 at December 31, 2003, and $15 million at December 31, 2002. The accrued expenses at December 31, 2003, were related to
office closures. The accrued expenses at December 31, 2002, were primarily related to office closures and employee severance.  R.CORPORATE FINANCING SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  In February 2004, the Company entered into a $275 million convertible note with Laurus, our line of credit provider. The note carries an interest rate of
20% over the prime rate or a minimum of 60% and has a term of 3 years. The principal and interest on the note may be converted into common stock of the Company at a fixed conversion price of $261 per share. A portion of the proceeds from this
transaction were used to retire the current mortgage debt on the Glasgow facility. The remaining proceeds of approximately $750,000 will be used to complete the build-out of the Glasgow facility, complete the consolidation our operations into the
new facility and provide funds for operations.  In February
2004, Laurus waived the borrowing base limitation on the Companys line of credit, thereby making the full $75 million facility available to the Company regardless of the available collateral. The waiver will expire on December 19, 2004. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $30 million outstanding on this line of credit facility based upon its current eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances. The waiver, and the resulting access to the full amount of the line
of credit, provides additional access to liquidity for the Company. Additionally, in January and February 2004, Laurus exercised its conversion rights on the line of credit and converted $20 million of amounts outstanding on the line into
approximately 910,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
