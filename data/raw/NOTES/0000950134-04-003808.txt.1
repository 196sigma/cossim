Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis presents
factors, which we believe are relevant to an assessment and
understanding of our consolidated financial position and results
of operations. This financial and business analysis should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and the related notes included in Item8. Also see
Item6 for related financial information. Overview Dobson
Communications. We are one of the
largest providers of rural and suburban wireless communications
systems in the United States. We began providing wireless
telephone services in 1990 in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.
We have rapidly expanded our wireless operations with an
acquisition strategy targeting underdeveloped rural and suburban
areas, which we believe have a significant number of potential
customers with substantial needs for wireless communications. On
August19, 2003, American Cellular Corporation became our
wholly-owned subsidiary. At December31, 2003, American
Cellulars systems covered a total population of
50million and had approximately 709,200 subscribers,
giving American Cellular an aggregate market penetration of
142%. At December31, 2003, our wireless systems covered a
population of 106million and we had approximately
1,552,100 subscribers, with an aggregate market penetration of
146%. Concurrently with the August19, 2003
acquisition and restructuring of American Cellular described
below, we merged our indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries,
Dobson/ Sygnet Communications Company, Sygnet Wireless, Inc.,
and Sygnet Communications, Inc. with and into our wholly-owned
subsidiary, DCS. As a result of these mergers, and the
acquisition and restructuring of American Cellular, our
operations are encompassed in our two primary subsidiaries, DCS
and American Cellular. American Cellular does not guarantee any
debt or other obligations of DCS or us, and DCS and we do not
guarantee any debt or other obligations of American Cellular. As part of the American Cellular acquisition and
restructuring, we agreed to appoint to our Board of Directors
two persons who were recommended by the former holders of
American Cellulars 95% senior subordinated notes, and who
were acceptable to us and our principal shareholder, Dobson CC
Limited Partnership. We also agreed to limit the size of our
board of Directors to seven persons. Accordingly, on
February18, 2004, Messrs. Mark S. Feighner and Robert A.
Schriesheim became members of our Board, and Russell L. Dobson,
one of our founders and a long-time director, withdrew as a
director. Mr. Feighner is an experienced, strategic,
customer-focused wireless services executive. Mr. Schriesheim is
a highly qualified finance executive with significant experience
in maximizing shareholder value through operational and
financial improvements. American
Cellular. Until August18,
2003, we owned a 50% interest in a joint venture that owned
American Cellular. We accounted for our interest using the
equity method of accounting. As a result, through
August18, 2003, we reflected our equity share of the
American Cellular joint venture in a single line item entitled
Investment in joint venture in our balance sheet and
our share of the American Cellular joint ventures net
income or loss in a single line item entitled Loss from
investment in joint venture in our statement of operations. At June30, 2002 and continuing through
August2003, American Cellular was not in compliance with
its total debt leverage ratio covenant contained in its credit
facility. Due to this and other factors and circumstances in
existence in 2002, American Cellular re-evaluated the carrying
value of its goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets in
accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No142. These re-evaluations resulted in American
Cellulars recognition of impairment losses totaling
$3770million at June30, 2002 and
$4239million at December 31, 2002. After recognizing our
portion of the impairment at June30, 2002, our investment
in the American Cellular joint venture was written down to zero.
Therefore, the December31, 2002 impairment loss of
$4239million did not impact our results of operations or
financial condition. 26 Table of Contents On August19, 2003, we completed the
restructuring of American Cellulars indebtedness and
equity ownership. Pursuant to this restructuring, we completed
an exchange offer for American Cellulars then outstanding
95% senior subordinated notes due 2009 the existing
notes. Holders of $6819million of the existing
notes exchanged their notes for 439million shares of our
Class A common stock, 681,900 shares of our SeriesF
convertible preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation
preference of $1218million, convertible into a maximum of
139million shares of our Class A common stock, and $487
million in cash. We also issued 4,301 shares of our
SeriesF convertible preferred stock and 276,848 shares of
our Class A common stock in payment of certain fees. Upon
consummation of the restructuring, American Cellular became our
wholly-owned subsidiary. Subsequently, all significant
subsidiaries of American Cellular were merged into American
Cellular. On August8, 2003, ACC Escrow Corp., our
newly formed, wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary, completed an
offering of $900million aggregate principal amount of 10%
senior notes due 2011. The senior notes were issued at par and
were assumed by American Cellular when ACC Escrow Corp. merged
into American Cellular as part of the restructuring. The net
proceeds from the offering were used to fully repay American
Cellulars existing bank credit facility and to pay
expenses of the restructuring. American Cellular has filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission an Annual Report on Form10-K for
the year ended December31, 2003. While we provide you with
much of American Cellulars financial and operational
information for 2003, we refer you to American Cellulars
Annual Report to ensure you have a complete understanding of
American Cellulars financial and operational results. Acquisitions and Discontinued
Operations Maryland/ Michigan
Swap. On February17, 2004,
we transferred our Maryland RSA 2 wireless property in exchange
for Cingular Wireless Michigan RSA 5 wireless property 220million in cash and its one-percent ownership
interests in Texas RSA 2 and Oklahoma RSAs 5 and 7. We are the
majority owner of these three markets. As a result of a
definitive agreement that was entered into prior to
December31, 2003 and closed on February17, 2004, we
have reclassified our historical financial statements to reflect
the operations of our Maryland RSA 2 property as discontinued
operations as of December31, 2003. Acquisition of
NPI. On December23, 2003, we
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of NPI
for approximately $28million. NPI owns PCS licenses
covering a total population of 12million. Its GSM network
currently covers a total population of 10million in
northern Michigan. NPI has approximately 35,000 subscribers. The
transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004,
subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing
conditions. California/ Alaska
Swap. On June17, 2003, we
transferred our two remaining wireless properties in California
to ATT Wireless in exchange for its two wireless properties
in Alaska, and all of the outstanding shares of our Series AA
preferred stock that it previously held, which we then
cancelled. We have reclassified our historical financial
statements to reflect the operations of our California
properties as discontinued operations. As a result of the
completion of this transaction, our financial statements include
the operating results from June17, 2003 through
December31, 2003 and the assets and liabilities as of
December31, 2003 of the two Alaska properties. Verizon
Sales. On February8, 2002,
we sold three of our wireless properties to Verizon Wireless for
a total purchase price of $2630million. These properties
included California 7 RSA, Ohio 2 RSA and Georgia 1 RSA, which
covered a total population of approximately 659,000. On
February28, 2002, we sold our 75% ownership interest in
Arizona 5 RSA to Verizon Wireless for a total purchase price of
$850million. Arizona 5 RSA covered a total population of
approximately 199,200. On February8, 2002, American
Cellular sold Tennessee 4 RSA to Verizon Wireless for a total
purchase price of $2020million. Tennessee 4RSA
covered a total population of approximately 290,800. As a result
of these sales, the results of operations, assets and
liabilities of these markets during the periods presented are
included as discontinued operations in our consolidated
financial statements. American Cellular and we used the proceeds
from the sale of these properties primarily to pay down bank
debt under our respective credit facilities. 27 Table of Contents Trends and Guidance On February18, 2004, we held an
investors conference regarding our fourth quarter 2003
results of operations, certain trends in our roaming operations
and business plans and guidance for 2004. We believe that the
information provided during the investors conference is
important to an understanding of us, trends in our business and
our future operating expectations. While we summarize below much
of the information provided at the conference, we refer you to
our Form8-K filed with the Commission on February18,
2004, as well as to our website to obtain a copy of the
presentation used in the conference, as well as to listen to the
rebroadcast of the conference. Subscribers Our subscriber base contains three types of
subscribers; post-paid, reseller and pre-paid. At
December31, 2003, post-paid subscribers accounted for
935% of our subscriber base. These subscribers pay a monthly
access fee for a wireless service plan that generally includes a
fixed amount of minutes and certain service features. In
addition to the monthly access fee, these subscribers are
typically billed in arrears for long-distance charges, roaming
charges and rate plan overages. Our reseller subscribers are
similar to our post-paid subscribers in that they pay monthly
fees to utilize our network and services. However, these
subscribers are billed by a third party reseller, who has
effectively resold our service to the end user subscriber. We
in turn bill the third party resellerfor the monthly
usage of the end user subscriber. At December31, 2003,
the reseller base accounted for 46% of our total subscriber
base. Our pre-paid subscribers, which at December31, 2003
accounted for 19% of our subscriber base, are subscribers that
pre-pay for an agreed upon amount of usage. Our average monthly revenue per subscriber,
discussed below under Revenue, and our total gross
additions are calculated and reported based only on post-paid
subscriber information. We have experienced a decline in our
post-paid gross additions as a result of increased competition
attributable to an accelerating pace of improvements in quality
of digital technology, and increased products offered to the
consumer. Many of our competitors already provide market
enhanced data services, such as 1XRTT. Currently, we are in the
process of upgrading our network to GSM/ GPRS/ EDGE and expect
our gross subscriber additions to increase during 2004, as a
result of new services that will be available with GSM/ GPRS/
EDGE. Post-paid gross subscriber additions from our continuing
operations were 232,500, for the year ended December31,
2003. This included 78,400 from our recent acquisitions, from
the date of their respective acquisition. Post-paid gross
subscriber additions were 204,700 for the year ended
December31, 2002 and 214,800, for the year ended
December31, 2001. Revenue Our operating revenue consists of service
revenue, roaming revenue and equipment and other revenue. We derive service revenue by providing wireless
services to our subscribers. The wireless industry has
experienced declining average revenue per minute as competition
among wireless service providers has led to reductions in rates
for airtime. These declines have generally been offset by
significant increases in average minutes-of-use per subscriber.
As a result, our average monthly revenue per post-paid
subscriber has remained constant, amounting to $42 for the year
ended December31, 2003, $44 excluding the impact of our
2003 acquisitions, $44 for the year ended December31,
2002, and $44 for the year ended December31, 2001. We
believe there is an opportunity in 2004 for our average monthly
revenue per post-paid subscriber to increase from current levels
primarily due to additional voice and data services available as
a result of our providing GSM/ GPRS/ EDGE technology. We derive roaming revenue by providing service to
subscribers of other wireless providers when those subscribers
roam into our markets and use our systems to carry
their calls. Roaming revenues have traditionally had higher
margins than revenues from our subscribers. We achieve these
higher margins because we incur relatively lower incremental
costs related to network operations, billing, customer service
and collections in servicing roaming customers as compared to
our home subscribers. However, our roaming margins are declining
and are becoming more comparable to margins from our subscribers
due to increased 28 Table of Contents market pressures and competition among wireless
providers resulting in reduced rates in our new roaming
contracts and scheduled rate reductions in our existing roaming
contracts. Our roaming yield roaming service revenue, which
includes airtime, toll charges and surcharges, divided by
roaming minutes-of-use was $020 for the year ended
December31, 2003, $025 for the year ended
December31, 2002 and $035 for the year ended
December31, 2001. On a combined basis, DCS and American
Cellular, had a roaming yield of $020 for the year ended
December31, 2003. We expect our roaming yield to decline
by approximately 30% during 2004. Even though these roaming
contracts provide for decreasing rates over time, we believe
these roaming contracts are beneficial because they secure
existing traffic and provide opportunity for a continuing
increase in traffic volumes. Roaming revenue tends to be
impacted by seasonality. Historically, we have experienced
higher roaming minutes-of-use and related roaming revenue during
the second and third quarters of each year, as users tend to
travel more and, therefore, use their wireless phones more,
during the spring and summer months. We include long-distance revenue in service
revenue and roaming revenue. Equipment revenue is revenue from
selling wireless equipment to our subscribers. Equipment revenue
is recognized when the equipment is delivered to the customer. Costs and Expenses Our primary operating expense categories include
cost of service, cost of equipment, marketing and selling costs,
general and administrative costs and depreciation and
amortization. Our cost of service consists primarily of costs
to operate and maintain our facilities utilized in providing
service to customers and amounts paid to third-party wireless
providers for providing service to our subscribers when our
subscribers roam into their markets, referred to as
roaming costs. Consistent with the trend of
declining roaming revenue per minute, our roaming expense per
minute has declined as well. As a result, our cash cost per user
has continued to decline. Our cash cost per user was $22 for the
year ended December31, 2003, $25 for the year ended
December31, 2002, and $26 for the year ended
December31, 2001. This decline in expense per minute has
contributed significantly to the recent trend of declining cost
of service. Our cost of equipment represents the costs
associated with wireless equipment and accessories sold to
customers. In recent years, we and other wireless providers have
continued the use of discounts on phone equipment and free phone
promotions, as competition between service providers has
intensified. As a result, we have incurred, and expect to
continue to incur, losses on equipment sales. While we expect to
continue these discounts and promotions, we believe that these
promotions will result in increased revenue from increases in
the number of wireless subscribers. Our marketing and selling costs include
advertising, compensation paid to sales personnel and
independent agents and all other costs to market and sell
wireless products and services. We pay commissions to sales
personnel and independent dealers for new business generated. Our general and administrative costs include all
infrastructure costs, including costs for customer support,
billing, collections, and corporate administration. Our depreciation and amortization expense
represents the costs associated with the depreciation of our
fixed assets and the amortization of certain intangible assets. Critical Accounting Policies and
Practices It is necessary that we use estimates in the
presentation of our financial statements with respect to the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our use of
estimates and assumptions affects the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, and the amount of revenues and expenses we
recognize for and during the reporting period. Our general and administrative expenses and
certain other operating expenses include all infrastructure
costs, including costs for customer support, billing,
collections and corporate administration. We share our 29 Table of Contents corporate and shared call center costs with our
subsidiaries, which are costs allocated primarily based on the
estimated subscribers and populations in their respective
licensed areas. We depreciate our property, plant and equipment
and amortize our customer lists and certain other intangible
assets over their useful lives. These useful lives are based on
our estimates of the period that the assets will generate
revenue. With the implementation of SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which requires
companies to cease the amortization of existing goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives, we reassessed the
useful lives of our intangible assets. A significant portion of
our intangible assets is classified as Wireless license
acquisition costs, which represents our costs associated
with acquiring our FCC licenses. These licenses allow us to
provide wireless services by giving us the exclusive right to
utilize certain radio frequency spectrum. Although the FCC
licenses are issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years,
these licenses are renewed by the FCC on a routine basis and for
a nominal fee. In addition, we have determined that there are no
legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other
factors that limit the useful life of these FCC licenses. As a
result, our wireless license acquisition costs are treated as
indefinite life intangible assets. Therefore, upon implementing
SFAS No142 in its entirety, we ceased the amortization of
both goodwill and wireless license acquisition costs and now
test for impairment of goodwill and wireless license acquisition
costs at least annually and only adjust the carrying amount of
these intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill and
wireless license acquisition costs. We also determine on an
annual basis whether facts and circumstances continue to support
an indefinite useful life. This change in policy has and may continue to
have a significant impact on our results of operations and
financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the
aggregate amount of amortization expense, net of income tax
benefit, attributable to our wireless license acquisition costs
was $649 million. Without this amortization and before
considering the impact of this change on American Cellular, our
2001 operating results would have been

In addition, for the year ended December31,

benefit, related to its wireless license acquisition costs.

As stated above, through December31, 2001,
our accounting policy for impairment of long-lived assets was to
review the carrying value of our long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. If such circumstances were deemed to exist, the
carrying value of the asset would be compared to the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset. Our
definite life assets will continue to be amortized over their
estimated useful lives and are subject to the same impairment
criteria. As a result of fully implementing SFAS No142 on
January1, 2002, we are required to evaluate the carrying
value of our indefinite life intangible assets at least
annually, using their fair values. To complete this evaluation,
we compare the carrying amount of our wireless license
acquisition costs to the fair value of those assets. For
purposes of this comparison, it is our policy to aggregate our
wireless license acquisition costs. We determine the fair value
of our wireless license acquisition costs based on their
estimated future discounted cash flows. 30 Table of Contents Based on the comparison we performed upon
implementation, we concluded that the carrying amount of our
wireless license acquisition costs exceeded their estimated fair
value. Therefore, upon implementation of this new pronouncement
in its entirety, we recorded a charge, net of income tax
benefit, of $333million to reflect the write-down of our
wireless license acquisition costs to their fair value and a
charge of $1408 million to reflect our previously owned 50%
share in the write down to their fair value of the wireless
license acquisition costs of American Cellular. We believe it is necessary for an understanding
of our significant accounting policies to read the above in
conjunction with Note 2, Significant Accounting
Policies, to our financial statements included in
Item8 of this Form10-K. These other significant
accounting policies, while not involving the same level of
measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are
nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial
statements. Policies related to revenue recognition, financial
instruments and business combinations require judgments on
complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of
authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among
topics currently under re-examination by accounting standard
setters and regulatory authorities. Although no specific
conclusions reached by these standard setters or regulatory
authorities appear likely to cause a material change in our
accounting policies, we cannot predict the outcomes with
certainty. Results of Operations The financial statement numbers have been
rounded; however, the percentage changes are based on the actual
financial statement numbers.   
Year Ended December31, 2003 Compared
to Year Ended December31, 2002 Operating
revenue. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our total operating revenue increased
$2190million, or 424%, to $7358million from
$5168million for the comparable period in 2002. The
following table sets forth the components of our operating
revenue for the periods indicated

For the year ended December31, 2003, our
service revenue increased $1828 million, or 566%, to
$5059million from $3231million for the year ended
December31, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable
to our acquisition of American Cellular on August19, 2003,
and the two Alaska properties we acquired on June17, 2003,
the acquisitions. The acquisitions during 2003
accounted for $1639million of our service revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Before giving effect to these
acquisitions, our service revenue increased
$189million. This increase was primarily attributable to
our increased subscriber base in our non-acquisition markets.
Our average subscriber base in our non-acquisition markets
increased 84%, to 654,800, for the year ended December31,
2003, from 603,800, for the year ended December31, 2002. For the year ended December31, 2003, our
roaming revenue increased $251 million, or 142%, to
$2012million from $1761million for the year ended
December31, 2002. The acquisitions during 2003 accounted
for $446million of our roaming revenue for the year ended
December31, 2003. Before giving effect to these
acquisitions, our roaming revenue decreased $195million.
This is primarily a result of a 200% decline in our roaming
revenue per minute-of-use in our non-acquisition markets as
contractual rates decreased during 2003. This decline in our
roaming revenue per minute-of-use in our non-acquisition markets
was partially offset by a 128% increase in roaming minutes in
our non-acquisition markets due to expanded coverage areas and
increased usage. 31 Table of Contents For the year ended December31, 2003, our
equipment and other revenue increased $112million, or
639%, to $287million from $175million for the
year ended December31, 2002. The acquisitions during 2003
accounted for $79 million of our equipment and other revenue
for the year ended December31, 2003. Before giving effect
to these acquisitions, our equipment and other revenue
increased $33million. This is primarily due to increases
in amounts previously charged to our unconsolidated affiliates
for the use of shared assets. Cost of
service. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our total cost of service increased
$352million, or 255%, to $1734million from $1382
million for the comparable period in 2002. The acquisitions
during 2003 accounted for $504million of our cost of
service for the year ended December 31, 2003. Before giving
effect to these acquisitions, our cost of service
decreased $152million. The following table sets forth the

For the year ended December31, 2003, our
network costs, which are the costs incurred from operating our
wireless network and providing service to our customers,
increased by $282million, or 360% to $1064million
from $782 million for the comparable period in 2002. The
acquisitions during 2003 accounted for $313million of our
network costs for the year ended December 31, 2003. Before
giving effect to these acquisitions, network costs
declined $31million. This is primarily a result of
credits received from certain of our network service providers
and renegotiated lower local access rates charged to us by
third-party providers for use of local access across the network. For the year ended December31, 2003,
roaming costs increased by $70 million, or 117%, to
$670million from $600million for the comparable
period in 2002. The acquisitions during 2003 accounted for
$191million of our roaming costs for the year ended
December31, 2003. Before giving effect to these
acquisitions, roaming costs declined $121million.
This is primarily a result of a 250% decline in rates charged
by those providers resulting from new lower rate agreements,
offset by an 52% increase in the minutes used by our customers
on third-party wireless providers networks, in our
non-acquisition markets. Cost of
equipment. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our cost of equipment increased
$163million, or 404%, to $566million during 2003
from $403million in 2002. The acquisitions during 2003
accounted for $170million of our cost of equipment for
the year ended December31, 2003. Before giving effect to
these acquisitions, our cost of equipment decreased
$07million. This is primarily a result of a decrease in
gross subscriber additions in our non-acquisition markets. Marketing and selling
costs. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our marketing and selling costs
increased $179million, or 292%, to $795million
from $616million for the year ended December31,
2002. The acquisitions during 2003 accounted for
$245million of our marketing and selling costs for the
year ended December31, 2003. Before giving effect to these
acquisitions, our marketing and selling costs decreased
$66million. This is primarily a result of the decrease in
gross subscriber additions in our non-acquisition markets. General and administrative
costs. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our general and administrative costs
increased $396million, or 596%, to $1061million
from $665million for the year ended December31,
2002. The acquisitions during 2003 accounted for
$387million of our general and administrative costs for
the year ended December31, 2003. Before giving effect to
these acquisitions, our general and administrative costs
increased $09 million. This increase is a result of increased
infrastructure costs such as customer service, billing, and
administrative costs as a result of the overall growth of our
business, offset by the 32 Table of Contents reductions in bad debt expense as a result of
improved collections and efficiencies gained from further
integration of acquired companies and increased economies of
scale in our non-acquisition markets. Overall, our average
monthly general and administrative costs per average subscriber
decreased 56% to approximately $850 for 2003 compared to
approximately $900 for 2002 in our non-acquisition markets. Depreciation and amortization
expense. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our depreciation and amortization
expense increased $442million, or 588%, to
$1194million from $752million for 2002. The
acquisitions during 2003 accounted for $328million of our
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended
December31, 2003. Before giving effect to these
acquisitions, our depreciation and amortization expense
increased $114million. This increase in our
non-acquisition markets is a result of additional depreciation
on fixed assets acquired in 2002 and 2003. Interest
expense. For the year ended
December31, 2003, our interest expense increased
$298million, or 275%, to $1381million from $1083
million for the year ended December31, 2002. The
acquisitions during 2003 accounted for $378million of our
interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2003. Before
giving effect to these acquisitions, our interest expense
decreased $80million. This is primarily the result of the
repayment of our outstanding balance on our Dobson Operating Co.
LLC and Sygnet Wireless credit facilities and decreased variable
interest rates as a result of lower interest rates and the
expiration of our interest rate hedges, offset by the interest
expense on our new DCS credit facility. Loss gain from extinguishment of debt.
For the year ended
December31, 2003, our loss from extinguishment of debt was
$523million, compared to a gain of $22million for
the year ended December31, 2002. The loss from
extinguishment of debt for the year ended December31,
2003, was due to paying off the DOC LLC credit facility, the
Sygnet credit facility and $1833million principal amount
of the Dobson/ Sygnet senior notes. Our gain from extinguishment
of debt for the year ended December31, 2002, resulted from
the repurchase of $115million principal amount of Dobson/
Sygnet senior notes for the purchase price of $89million. Redemptions and repurchases of, and
dividends on, preferred stock. For
the year ended December31, 2003, our redemptions and
repurchases of and dividends on preferred stock are represented
as both a financing expense, included in our net loss, and as an
item below our net loss, reflected only in our net loss
applicable to common shareholders. This change in presentation
is the result of implementing SFAS No150 during 2003,
which requires dividends on mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock and any gains or losses on redemption and repurchases of
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to be reflected as a
financing expense included in net income lossfor periods
beginning after June15, 2003. Thus, our income statement
includes the following

Although our dividends on preferred stock are in
two separate lines items for the year ended December31,
2003, they totaled $739million, on a combined basis,
which compares to $945million for the year ended
December31, 2002. This decrease in dividends of
$206million is the result of the reduction in the number
of shares of our preferred stock outstanding due to redemptions
and repurchases of our preferred stock during 2002 and 2003. During the year ended December31, 2003,
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 150, we repurchased a total of
$327million liquidation preference amount of our 1225%
senior exchangeable preferred stock and $275million
liquidation preference amount of our 13% senior exchangeable
preferred stock, for an aggregate 33 Table of Contents purchase price of $366million. Including
deferred financing costs, this resulted in a gain on repurchase
of preferred stock totaling $221million. In addition,
ATT Wireless transferred to us all of our SeriesAA
preferred stock, which had a fair value that was substantially
lower than our carrying value, thus resulting in a gain on
redemption of $1962million. Therefore, our total gain on
redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock prior to adoption
of SFAS No150 or July1, 2003, was
$2183million. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 150,
in 2003, we repurchased a total of $2931million
liquidation preference amount of our 1225% senior exchangeable
preferred stock, for an aggregate purchase price of
$3110million, which, including fees and the related write
off of deferred financing costs, resulted in a loss from
redemptions and repurchases of preferred stock of
$268million. Although our redemptions and repurchases of
preferred stock are in two separate lines items for the year
ended December31, 2003, they netted to a gain of
$1915million on a combined basis. During 2002, we repurchased shares of our 1225%
senior exchangeable preferred stock having a carrying value of
$403million and shares of our 13% senior exchangeable
preferred stock having a carrying value of $687million,
including accrued dividends on the repurchased shares, for an
aggregate purchase price of $387million. Including
deferred financing costs, this resulted in a gain on redemptions
and repurchases of preferred stock totaling $678million
for the year ended December31, 2002. Other income expense, net.
For the year ended
December31, 2003, our other income
expenseincreased by $54million, or 3340%, to
income of $38 million from an expense of $16million for
the year ended December31, 2002, due to an increase in
interest income during 2003 and the write off of costs
associated with the eleven licenses we did not receive in the
FCC auction, which were written off during 2002. Loss from investment in joint
venture. For the year ended
December31, 2002, we incurred a loss, net of income tax
benefit, before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle, from our previously owned joint
venture totaling $1844million. This loss represents our
previous proportionate loss in American Cellular, limited to our
previous investment in American Cellular. Discontinued
operations. For the year ended
December31, 2003, we had income from discontinued
operations including the gain on the sale of $267 million
compared to $1192million in 2002. Discontinued operations
during 2003 relate to both the California/ Alaska swap with
ATT Wireless and the Michigan/ Maryland swap with Cingular
Wireless, while discontinued operations in 2002 relate to the
California/ Alaska swap with ATT Wireless, the Michigan/
Maryland swap with Cingular Wireless and the markets sold to
Verizon Wireless. Cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle. For the year ended
December31, 2002, we recognized a total impairment on our
wireless license acquisition costs of approximately
$1741million, net of tax benefit, as a result of
implementing SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Of this total, $333million
reflects our impairment and $1408million reflects the
impairment from our then 50% interest in American Cellular. Net loss. For
the year ended December31, 2003, our net loss was $240
million. Our net loss decreased $1425million, from a net
loss of $1665 million for the year ended December31,
2002. The decrease in our net loss was primarily attributable to
our loss recognized in 2002 from the cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle and on our loss from our previous
investment in joint venture, offset by the gain from the sale of
discontinued operations. 34 Table of Contents

For the year ended December31, 2002, our
service revenue increased $416 million, or 148%, to
$3231million from $2815million for the year ended
December31, 2001. The increase in revenue was primarily
attributable to increased market penetration and subscriber
usage. Our average subscriber base increased 132% to 603,800 at
December31, 2002 from 534,700 at December31, 2001.
Even though we have experienced increased competition and market
pressure, our average monthly service revenue per subscriber
remained constant, because our average monthly service revenue
per subscriber continues to be positively impacted by changes in
the mix of digital and analog subscribers in our subscriber
base. Our digital subscribers tend to use more minutes in a
larger home area than our analog subscribers. For the year ended December31, 2002, our
roaming revenue decreased $105 million, or 56%, to
$1762million from $1867million for the year ended
December31, 2001. This decline in revenue was attributable
to a 272% decline in our roaming revenue per minute-of-use,
partially offset by a 295% increase in roaming minutes in our
markets. For the year ended December31, 2002, our
equipment and other revenue decreased $17million, or
88%, to $175million from $192million for the year
ended December31, 2001. This decline in revenue is
primarily due to our slight decline in gross subscriber
additions and the slow-down in the migration of existing
subscribers from analog to digital service. The migration of
subscribers from analog to digital service was 40,900 for the
year ended December31, 2002 compared to 85,100 for the
year ended December31, 2001. Cost of Service.
For the year ended
December31, 2002, our total cost of service decreased
$04million, or 02%, to $1382million from
$1386million for the comparable period in 2001. The

For the year ended December31, 2002, our
network costs, which are the costs we incurred from operating
our wireless network and providing service to our customers,
increased $93million, or 135%, to $782million
from $689 million for the comparable period in 2001. This
increase was primarily the result of an increase in wholesale
toll charges, due to increases in customer usage, and an
increase in rent incurred from our cell site leases as a result
of the continued build-out of our network. For the year ended December31, 2002,
roaming costs decreased by $96 million, or 138%, to
$600million from $696million for the comparable
period in 2001. This decrease was the result of a 291 35 Table of Contents decline in rates charged by those providers
resulting from new lower rate agreements, offset by a 215%
increase in the minutes used by our customers on third-party
wireless providers networks. Cost of
equipment. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our cost of equipment decreased
$36million, or 82%, to $403million during 2002
from $439million in 2001, primarily from a slow-down in
the migration of existing subscribers from analog to digital
service. Marketing and selling
costs. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our marketing and selling costs
decreased $05million, or 08%, to $616million from
$621million for the year ended December31, 2001.
This decrease in our marketing and selling costs was primarily
the result of gross subscriber additions remaining fairly
constant and the costs associated with sales compensation
reducing slightly. General and administrative
costs. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our general and administrative costs
increased $60million, or 99%, to $665 million from
$605million for the year ended December31, 2001.
This increase was primarily the result of increased
infrastructure costs, including customer service, billing,
collections and administrative costs as a result of the overall
growth of our business. Our average monthly general and
administrative costs per subscriber remained constant at $9 for
2002 and 2001. This consistency in general and administrative
costs per subscriber was primarily from continued efficiencies
gained from further integration of acquired companies and
increased economies of scale. Depreciation and amortization
expense. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our depreciation and amortization
expense decreased $805million, or 517%, to
$752million from $1557million for 2001. This
decline in expense is a result of implementing SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
which required companies to stop amortizing existing goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective
January1, 2002. Under this new rule we treat our wireless
license acquisition costs as indefinite life intangible assets.
For the year ended December31, 2001, the aggregate amount
of amortization expense attributable to our wireless license
acquisition costs was $874million. Interest
expense. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our interest expense decreased
$209million, or 161%, to $1083million from $1292
million for the year ended December31, 2001. This decline
in expense resulted primarily from the reduction of our
outstanding balance on our credit facility and lower variable
interest rates. Loss gain from extinguishment of
debt. For the year ended
December31, 2002, we had a gain from extinguishment of
debt of $22million, net of tax expense, which resulted
primarily from the repurchase of $115million principal
amount of Dobson/ Sygnet senior notes for the purchase price of
$89 million. Other income expense,
net. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our other income
expensedecreased by $128million to an expense of
$16million from income of $112million for the year
ended December31, 2001 due to a decrease in interest
income and write off of costs associated with the eleven
licenses we did not receive in the FCC auction. Loss from investment in joint
venture. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our loss from investment in joint
venture increased $1152million, to $1844million,
from $692million for the year ended December31,
2001. This increase is primarily from impairments of goodwill
recognized by American Cellular. Income from discontinued
operations. For the year ended
December31, 2002, we had income from discontinued
operations including the gain on the sale of
$1192million, net of income tax expense, compared to
income of $11million, net of income tax expense, for the
year ended December31, 2001. This increase is primarily a
result of a gain of $951million from the sale of the
markets sold to Verizon Wireless during February2002.
Discontinued operations during 2002 and 2001 relate to the
California/ Alaska swap with ATT Wireless, the Michigan/
Maryland swap with Cingular Wireless and the markets sold to
Verizon Wireless. Cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle. For the year ended
December31, 2002, we recognized a total impairment on our
wireless license acquisition costs of $1741million, net
of tax benefit, as a result of implementing SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Of this total 333million 36 Table of Contents reflects our impairment and $1408million
reflects our share of the impairment from our then 50% interest
in American Cellular. Net loss. For
the year ended December31, 2002, our net loss was $1665
million. Our net loss increased $382million, or 298 from $1283million for the year ended December31,
2001. The increase in our net loss was primarily attributable to
our cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and our
loss from investment in joint venture, offset by the gain from
the sale of discontinued operations. Dividends on preferred
stock. For the year ended
December31, 2002, our dividends on preferred stock
increased $82million, or 94%, to $945million from
$863million for the year ended December31, 2001.
This increase was primarily the result of accrued dividends
related to our issuance of 200,000 shares of our SeriesAA
preferred stock on February8, 2001, and the additional
dividends accumulating on our 1225% and 13% senior exchangeable
preferred stock. Gain on redemption of preferred
stock. During 2002, we acquired
shares of our 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock having
a carrying value of $403 million and shares of our 13% senior
exchangeable preferred stock having a carrying value of
$687million through repurchases, including dividends
issued on the repurchased shares after the date of repurchase,
for an aggregate purchase price of $387million. Including
deferred financing costs, this resulted in a gain on redemption
of preferred stock totaling $678million. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have required, and will likely continue to
require, substantial capital to further develop, expand and
upgrade our wireless systems and those we may acquire. We plan
to finance our operations through cash flows from operating
activities, and if necessary, bank debt and the sale of debt and
equity securities.   
Cash Flow Activities At December31, 2003, we had working capital
of $1016million, a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities of 14:1 and an unrestricted cash balance of
$2082million, which compares to working capital of
$1701million, a ratio of current assets to current
liabilities of 19:1 and an unrestricted cash balance of
$2921million at December31, 2002. Working capital
has decreased due to our acquisition of American Cellular, our
capital expenditures for the build-out of the GSM/ GPRS/ EDGE
network and our preferred stock repurchases throughout the year. Our net cash provided by operating activities was
$2598million for the year ended December31, 2003
compared to $1875million for the year ended
December31, 2002 and $1072million for the year
ended December31, 2001. The increase of $723million
from 2002 to 2003 and $803million from 2001 to 2002 was
primarily due to an increase in operating income. Our net cash used in investing activities was
$1793million for the year ended December31, 2003,
compared to net cash provided by investing activities of
$3446million for the year ended December31, 2002,
and net cash used in investing activities of $2241million
for the year ended December31, 2001. The net cash used in
investing activities for the year ended December31, 2003
was primarily our capital expenditures of $1639million
and our purchase of outstanding interests in American Cellular
of $500million, offset by cash acquired through the
acquisition of American Cellular of $358million. The net
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended
December31, 2002 was primarily due to our receipt of a
refund of deposits of $1073million for eleven licenses in
the FCC auction and net proceeds from the sale of certain
markets to Verizon Wireless for a total of $3497million,
less $141million reserved in escrow. Our capital
expenditures were $1639million for the year ended
December31, 2003, $729million for the year ended
December31, 2002 and $828million for the year ended
December31, 2001. Our net cash used in financing activities was
$1643million for the year ended December31, 2003
and $4000million for the year ended December31,
2002 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of
$1349million for the year ended December31, 2001.
Financing activity sources for the year ended December31,
2003 consisted primarily of proceeds from long-term debt of $21
billion, which were more than 37 Table of Contents offset by repayments of long-term debt totaling
$19billion, distributions to partners of
$80million, purchases of preferred stock of
$3476million, preferred stock dividends of
$120million and deferred financing costs of
$471million. Financing activity sources for the year
ended December31, 2002 consisted primarily of proceeds
from long-term debt of $3895million, which was more than
offset by repayments of long-term debt totaling
$7259million, purchases of preferred stock of
$387million, purchases of common stock of
$78million and purchases of Dobson/ Sygnet senior notes
of $89million. The 2002 long-term debt payments were
partially funded by the proceeds of the sale of certain markets
to Verizon Wireless. For the year ended December31, 2001,
net cash provided by financing was considerably higher compared
to 2003 and 2002, due to issuance of preferred stock of $2000
million and proceeds of long-term debt of $6300million,
offset by repayments of long-term debt of $6994million.   
Capital Resources Current Capital Resources   
DCS Credit Facility On October23, 2003, our subsidiary, Sygnet
Wireless and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sygnet Communications,
were merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, DCS, and
immediately thereafter, Dobson Operating Co.LLC, or DOC
LLC, terminated its revolving credit facility. DCS then entered
into a new senior secured credit facility consisting of   
a 6-year $1500million senior secured
revolving credit facility, and
a 65-year $5500million senior secured
term loan facility.
The DCS credit facility is guaranteed by us, DOC
LLC and each of DCSs direct subsidiaries and is secured by
a first priority security interest in all of the tangible and
intangible assets of DCS. The DCS credit facility is not
guaranteed by American Cellular or any of its subsidiaries. Interest on the DCS credit facility is currently
based on a LIBOR formula plus a spread. At December31,
2003, we had $5486million outstanding under the term loan
of this credit facility, and we had the entire
$1500million of the revolving credit facility available. Under specified terms and conditions, including
covenant compliance, the amount available under the DCS credit
facility may be increased by an incremental facility of up to
$2000million. We have the right to make no more than four
requests to increase the amount of the credit facility and with
respect to the revolving credit facility, it must be made at
least 12months prior to the credit termination date and
with respect to the term loan facility, it must be made within
30months of the closing date. Any incremental facility
will have a maturity greater than the weighted average life of
the existing debt under the DCS credit facility. Under the DCS credit facility there are mandatory
scheduled principal or amortization payments of the term loan
facility and no reductions in commitments under the revolving
credit facility. The term loan facility will amortize 1% per
annum for the first 55years and in equal quarterly
installments for the balance in the final year. The revolving
credit facility is scheduled to mature in April2009 and
the term loan facility is scheduled to mature in
April2010. However, if we have not refinanced or repaid
our $300 million principal amount of 10875% senior notes by
January31, 2010, then the term loan facility will mature
on January31, 2010. DCS also is required to make mandatory reductions
of the credit facility with the net cash proceeds received from
certain issuances of debt and equity and upon any material sale
of assets by DCS and its subsidiaries. The DCS credit facility agreement contains
covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, limit our
ability to   
make capital expenditures;
sell or dispose of assets;
38 Table of Contents   
incur additional debt;
create liens;
merge with or acquire other companies;
engage in transactions with affiliates, including
dividend restrictions; and
make loans, advances or stock repurchases.
Dobson Senior Notes   
8875% Senior Notes On September26, 2003, we completed the
private sale of $6500million principal amount of 8875%
senior notes due 2013. The net proceeds from the sale of the
notes were used to irepay in full all amounts owing
under the bank credit facility of DOC LLC, and
iitogether with subsidiary funds, repay in part amounts
owing under the bank credit facility of Sygnet Wireless, Inc.
The senior notes rank pari passu in right of payment with any of
our existing and future senior indebtedness and are senior to
all existing and future subordinated indebtedness. American
Cellular is an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of our
8875% senior notes. In connection with the closing of the sale of the
notes, we entered into an indenture dated September26,
2003 with Bank of Oklahoma, National Association, as Trustee.
The indenture contains certain covenants including, but not
limited to, covenants that limit our ability and that of our
restricted subsidiaries to   
incur indebtedness;
incur or assume liens;
make restricted payments;
impose dividend or other payment restrictions
affecting our restricted subsidiaries;
issue and sell capital stock of our restricted
subsidiaries;
issue certain capital stock;
issue guarantees of indebtedness;
enter into transactions with affiliates;
sell assets;
engage in unpermitted lines of business;
enter into sale or leaseback transactions; and
make payments for the consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the provisions of the Indenture.
Our Board of Directors has authorized us to
expend up to $50million to repurchase some of our
outstanding 10875% senior notes and 8875% senior notes.
Through March11, 2004, we had repurchased
$555million principal amount of our 8875% senior notes
at an aggregate cost of $483 million, excluding accrued
interest.   
10875% Senior Notes On June15, 2000, we completed the private
sale of $3000million principal amount of our 10875%
senior notes due 2010. We used the proceeds to repay
indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of DOC LLC, and
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The
senior notes rank pari passu in right of payment with any of our
existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness and are senior
to all existing and future subordinated indebtedness. American
Cellular is an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of our
8875% senior notes. 39 Table of Contents In connection with the closing of the sale of the
notes, we entered into an indenture with United States Trust
Company of New York, as Trustee. The indenture contains certain
covenants including, but not limited to, covenants that limit
our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to   
incur indebtedness;
incur or assume liens;
make restricted payments;
impose dividend or other payment restrictions
affecting our restricted subsidiaries;
issue and sell capital stock of our restricted
subsidiaries;
issue certain capital stock;
issue guarantees of indebtedness;

enter into sale or leaseback transactions; and
make payments for the consent, waiver or

Preferred Stock During August2003, in conjunction with the
American Cellular reorganization, we issued 686,201 shares of
our SeriesF convertible preferred stock having an
aggregate liquidation preference of $1225million, plus
$487million in cash and 439million shares of our
ClassA common stock to the former holders of
$6819million principal amount of American Cellulars
outstanding 95%Senior Subordinated Notes due 2009 and
their advisors. Our outstanding SeriesF convertible
preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of
$1253 million, including accrued dividends, at
December31, 2003. As of December31, 2003, we had outstanding
60,997 shares of 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock with
an aggregate liquidation value of $610 million, including
accrued stock dividends, and 196,003 shares of our 13% senior
exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation value
of $2003million, including accrued stock dividends. Each
certificate of designation for our senior preferred stock
contains restrictive covenants, which may limit our ability to
incur indebtedness in the future. During 2002, we repurchased
shares of our 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock having
a carrying value of $403million and shares of our 13%
senior exchangeable preferred stock having a carrying value of
$687million, including accrued dividends attributable to
the repurchased shares, for an aggregate purchase price of
$387million. Including deferred financing costs, this
repurchase resulted in a gain on redemption and repurchase of
preferred stock totaling $678million. During the first
quarter of 2003, we repurchased a total of $327million
carrying value of our 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock
and $275million carrying value of our 13% senior
exchangeable preferred stock. The preferred stock repurchased
totaled 60,207 shares for $366million, all of which were
canceled by March31, 2003. Including deferred financing
costs, this repurchase resulted in a gain on redemption and
repurchase of preferred stock totaling $221million. On
October31, 2003, we repurchased an additional 246,967
shares of our 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock, and on
December30, 2003, we repurchased an additional 46,134
shares of our 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock. We
adopted SFASNo150 in July2003. Accordingly,
our October and December repurchases resulted in a loss from
extinguishment of debt totaling $268million, included in
income from continuing operations.   
American Cellular Senior
Notes In connection with the American Cellular
reorganization, on August8, 2003, ACC Escrow Corp. now
American Cellular completed an offering of $9000 million
aggregate principal amount of 10% senior notes 40 Table of Contents due 2011. These senior notes were issued at par.
On August19, 2003, ACC Escrow Corp. was merged into
American Cellular, and the net proceeds from the offering were
used to fully repay American Cellulars existing bank
credit facility, and to pay expenses of the offering and a
portion of the expenses of the restructuring. We are not a
guarantor of these senior notes. During 2001, American Cellular sold, in two
transactions, $700million principal amount of 95% senior
subordinated notes due 2009 at a discount of $69million.
The discount was being amortized over the life of the notes. In
August2003, as part of the restructuring of American
Cellular, holders of $6819million outstanding principal
amount of these senior notes received approximately
$487million in cash, 439million shares of newly
issued shares of our Class A common stock, and 681,900 shares of
a new series of our convertible preferred stock, which has an
aggregate liquidation preference of approximately
$1218million and is convertible into a maximum of
139million shares of our Class A common stock. There
remains outstanding $181million liquidation value of
American Cellulars 95% senior subordinated notes. American Cellular has required, and will likely
continue to require, substantial capital to further develop,
expand and upgrade its wireless systems. Terminated Capital Resources   
Dobson Operating Co., L.L.C. Credit
Facility On January14, 2000, our subsidiary, DOC
LLC, obtained an $8000million credit facility and
increased it by $1250million to $9250million on
May1, 2000. This credit facility was guaranteed by certain
subsidiaries of DOC LLC and by us. On September26, 2003,
we used a portion of the net proceeds of our offering of
$650million of our 8875% senior notes to repay all
amounts outstanding under this credit facility. This repayment
resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of
$110million due to the write-off of related deferred
financing costs.   
Dobson/ Sygnet Senior Notes Prior to September30, 2002, our subsidiary,
Dobson/Sygnet Communications Company, or Dobson/Sygnet, had
outstanding $2000million aggregate principal amount of
senior notes due 2008. On September30, 2002, we purchased
$115million principal amount of the Dobson/Sygnet notes
for the purchase price of $89million. This repurchase
resulted in a gain from extinguishment of debt of
$22million after the write-off of related deferred
financing costs. On October24, 2003, we purchased an
additional $1833million principal amount of these senior
notes. This repurchase resulted in a loss from extinguishment of
debt of $203million due to the write-off of related
deferred financing costs. In 2004, we redeemed the remaining
$52million of these senior notes.   
Sygnet Wireless Credit
Facility Our former subsidiary, Sygnet Wireless,was a
party to a secured credit agreement for an aggregate of
$2671million, consisting of a $34million revolving
credit facility and $2637million of term loans. Interest
on the revolving credit facility and the term loan facilities
was based on a prime rate or a LIBOR formula. The weighted
average interest rate for the year ended December31, 2003
was 42% and interest rates have ranged between 33% and 105%
since inception of the credit facility. On September26,
2003, we used a portion of the net proceeds of our offering of
$650million 8875% senior notes to repay
$2131million of this credit facility. In
October2003, the remaining balance on this credit facility
was paid off. For the year ended December31, 2003, this
repayment resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of
$210million due to the write-off of related deferred
financing costs.   
Dobson Senior Notes and Preferred
Stock On January14, 2000, we repurchased
$1597million and in May2002, we repurchased
$03million principal amount out of $1600million
aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 1175% senior
notes due 41 Table of Contents 2007. The notes were to mature in
April2007. We repurchased our outstanding senior notes
with funds available under our then outstanding DOC LLC credit
facility. On February8, 2001, we issued 200,000
shares of our SeriesAA preferred stock to ATT
Wireless for aggregate cash proceeds of $2000million.
Each share of SeriesAA preferred stock was entitled to
cumulative annual dividends of 596% on the liquidation
preference of $1,000 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
At December31, 2002, we had 200,000 shares of
SeriesAA preferred stock issued and outstanding. Our
December31, 2002, balance sheet included
$230million in accrued dividends payable related to this
issue. Upon the consummation of our exchange agreement with
ATT Wireless on June17, 2003, we acquired and
cancelled all 200,000 outstanding shares of SeriesAA
preferred stock.   
DCCLP Our principal shareholder, Dobson CC Limited
Partnership, or DCCLP, and certain of its affiliates are parties
to credit agreements with Bank of America. To secure their
obligations under the credit agreements, DCCLP and its
affiliates initially pledged certain assets, which included
beneficial ownership of securities representing controlling
interests in DCCLP and in us. On May19, 2003, DCCLP
entered into an agreement with Bank of America to amend and
restructure DCCLPs loan. The agreement eliminates the
change of control risk to us related to possible future default
on the DCCLP loan. Under the new five-year loan agreement, the
amount owed by DCCLP to Bank of America has been reduced to
$600million, with interest payable at Bank of
Americas prime interest rate. Under the terms of the
agreement, DCCLP transferred 325million shares of our
Class A common stock to Bank of America. During the fourth
quarter of 2003, Bank of America sold all of our Class A common
stock it had acquired from DCCLP. Capital Commitments We had capital expenditures of
$1639million for the year ended December31, 2003.
We have plans to spend approximately $110million to
$140million for capital expenditures in 2004. The majority
of these planned expenditures will be spent in the first half of
2004 in relation to the build-out of our GSM/ GPRS/ EDGE
network. However, the amount and timing of capital expenditures
may vary depending on the rate at which we expand and develop
our wireless systems and whether we consummate additional
acquisitions. We may require additional financing for future
acquisitions, to refinance our debt at its final maturities and
to meet the mandatory redemption provision on our senior
exchangeable preferred stock. On November7, 2002, our Board of Directors
adopted a new stock purchase plan, which authorized us to
purchase up to 10million shares of our outstanding Class A
common stock over the next twelve months. There were no
purchases made under this stock purchase plan and it expired by
terms on November6, 2003. From time to time we expect to
purchase our outstanding debt or shares of our outstanding
preferred stock. We were obligated under an agreement to purchase
approximately $1500million of cell site and switching
equipment from Nortel Networks Corp. prior to July15,
2005. This commitment has been fulfilled as of
September30, 2003. As discussed in our 2004 investors
conference on February18, 2004, our growth in gross
subscribers, net subscribers and roaming minutes of use was
materially lower in the fourth quarter of 2003 than expected.
Due to expected lower growth in roaming minutes of use and lower
roaming rates in 2004, we anticipate lower roaming revenues in
2004, resulting in lower net income and cash flow from
operations in 2004. We refer you to our Form8-K filed with
the Commission on February18, 2004 for a more in-depth
discussion of our guidance for 2004. Although we cannot provide
any assurance, assuming successful implementation of our
strategy, including the further development of our wireless
systems and realization of our cash flows as anticipated, we
believe that borrowings available to us under our credit
facilities, the remaining balance of our unrestricted cash and
cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our
currently expected capital expenditures, working capital and
debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. The actual
amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ
materially from our estimates as a result of, among other
things, the demand for our services and regulatory,
technological and competitive developments. We currently expect
that we may need to refinance our indebtedness at their
respective maturities commencing in 2010. We 42 Table of Contents may also need to refinance our mandatory
redemption obligations under our senior preferred stock
commencing in 2008. Sources of additional financing may include
commercial bank borrowings, vendor financing and the sale of
equity or debt securities. We cannot assure you that any such
financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The table below sets forth all of our contractual
cash obligations as of December31, 2003, which are
obligations during the following years.

In addition to the above cash obligations,
beginning in 2003, we were required to pay cash dividends on our
1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock, and after
May1, 2004, we will be required to pay cash dividends on
our 13% senior exchangeable preferred stock. Based on the shares
outstanding as of December31, 2003, our cash dividends
would total $340million during 2004, $346 annually
during 2005, 2006 and 2007, $290million in 2008 and
$136million in 2009. In addition, we are required to pay cash interest
payments on our 10875% senior notes due 2010, our 8875% senior
notes due 2013 and American Cellulars 10%senior
notes due 2011. Cash interest on our 10875% senior notes will
total $326million annually through maturity in 2010, cash
interest on our 8875% senior notes will total
$577million annually through maturity in 2013 and cash
interest on American Cellulars 10%senior notes will
total $900million annually through maturity in 2011. Related Party Transactions We receive a variety of telecommunication
services from Syniverse Technologies, Inc., or Syniverse. Our
former President and Chief Operating Officer is the Chief
Executive Officer of Syniverse. We paid Syniverse
$45million for services provided in 2003. All services
were negotiated on an arms-length basis, and we believe the
terms of all services agreed to are fair to us and our
subsidiaries. For a further discussion regarding additional
relationships and related party transactions, we refer you to
our Proxy Statement for our 2004 annual meeting of shareholders,
which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
within 120days after December31, 2003, and which is
incorporated herein by reference under Item13 below. Forward-Looking Statements The description of our plans set forth herein,
including planned capital expenditures and acquisitions, are
forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995. These plans involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
Important factors that could cause actual capital expenditures,
acquisition activity or our performance to differ materially
from the plans include, without limitation, our ability to
satisfy the financial covenants of our outstanding debt and
preferred stock instruments and to raise additional capital; our
ability to manage our business successfully and to compete
effectively in our wireless business against competitors with
greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources;
changes in end-user requirements and preferences; the
development of other technologies and products that may gain
more commercial acceptance than those of ours; and adverse
regulatory changes. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only
as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or
revise these forward-looking statements to reflect 43 Table of Contents events or circumstances after the date hereof
including, without limitation, changes in our business strategy
or planned capital expenditures, or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events.   
Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk Our primary market risk relates to changes in
interest rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from
adverse changes in market prices and rates, including interest
rates. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The objective
of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative
impact of interest rate fluctuations on our earnings and equity.
The counterparty was a major financial institution. As of
December31, 2003, we did not have any interest rate hedges
due to their expiration in April2003. The interest expense
related to the expired hedges was $22million for the year
ended December31, 2003 and $140million for the year
ended December31, 2002, due to the decline in current
market interest rates. At December31, 2003, we had long-term debt
outstanding of $24billion, of which, $5486million
bears interest at floating rates. These rates averaged 50% for
the twelve months ended December31, 2003. One percentage
point of an interest rate adjustment would change our cash
interest payments on an annual basis by approximately
$55million. 44 Table of Contents

45 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Dobson Communications Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Dobson Communications Corporation and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2003 and 2002
and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 2003. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We did not audit the financial statements of ACC
Acquisition LLC, a 50percent owned investee joint
venture for the period ended December31, 2001. The
Companys equity in losses of ACC Acquisition LLC was
$69,900,766 for 2001. The financial statements of ACC
Acquisition LLC were audited by other auditors whose report has
been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to
the amounts included for ACC Acquisition LLC for the period
ended December31, 2001, is based solely on the report of
the other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the
report of the other auditors, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Dobson
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2003 and 2002 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years in the three year
period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. As discussed in Notes2 and3, to the
consolidated financial statements, as of January1, 2001
the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities and disposal of long-lived
assets and as of January1, 2002, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142 related to the change in accounting for
identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives.

1.
ORGANIZATION The Company, through its predecessors, was
organized in 1936 as Dobson Telephone Company and adopted its
current organizational structure in 2000. The Company is a
provider of rural and suburban wireless telephone services in
portions of Alaska, Arizona, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas,
Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.   
Capital Resources and Growth The Company has substantial indebtedness and debt
service requirements and is subject to significant financial
restrictions and limitations. If the Company is unable to
satisfy any of the covenants under the credit facilities
described in Note 6, including financial covenants, the
Company will be unable to borrow under the credit facilities
during such time period to fund its ongoing operations, planned
capital expenditures or other permissible uses. The Companys ability to manage future
growth will depend upon its ability to monitor operations,
control costs and maintain effective quality controls, all of
which will result in higher operating expenses. Any failure to
expand these areas and to implement and improve such systems,
procedures and controls in an efficient manner at a pace
consistent with the growth of the Companys business could
have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,
financial condition and results of operations.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries.
For financial reporting purposes, the Company reports 100% of
revenue and expenses for the markets for which it provides
wireless services. However, in a few of its markets, the Company
holds less than 100% of the equity ownership. The minority
stockholders and partners shares of income or losses
in those markets are reflected in the consolidated statements of
operations as minority interests in income of subsidiaries. For
financial reporting purposes, the Company consolidates each
subsidiary and partnership in which it has a controlling
interest greater than 50%. Significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in
unconsolidated partnerships where the Company does not have a
controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method. The Company is responsible for managing and
providing administrative services for certain partnerships of
which the Company is the majority partner. The Company is
accountable to the partners and shareholders for the execution
and compliance with contracts and agreements and for filing of
instruments required by law, which are made on behalf of these
partnerships. The Company also maintains the books and records
of these partnerships.   
Business Segment The Company operates in one business segment
pursuant to SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents of $2082million
at December31, 2003 and $2921million at
December31, 2002 consist of cash and short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 51 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

Continued   
Restricted Cash and
Investments Restricted cash and investments totaling
$120million at December31, 2003, and
$143million at December31, 2002, primarily
consisted of an escrow reserve to cover any future contingencies
related to the Companys sale of certain markets to Verizon
Wireless during February2002. As a result of having no
further contingencies related to the Verizon Wireless
transaction, the Company received $71million of the
escrow reserve during February2003. Subsequent to year
end, the Company received the remaining escrow reserve of
$113million from the Verizon Wireless transactions.   
Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts of
$33million at December31, 2003 and
$11million at December31, 2002 are based on a
percentage of aging receivables. The Company reviews it
allowance for doubtful accounts monthly by evaluating balances
for collectibility.   
Inventory The Company values its inventory using the
weighted average costing method of accounting or, if lower,
estimated market value.   
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost. Newly constructed wireless systems are added to property,
plant and equipment at cost, which includes contracted services,
direct labor, materials and overhead. Existing property, plant
and equipment purchased through acquisitions is recorded at its
fair value at the date of the purchase. Repairs, minor
replacements and maintenance are charged to operations as
incurred. The provisions for depreciation are provided using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the
various classes of depreciable property. Depreciation expense
totaling $989million was recorded for the year ended
December31, 2003, $621million for the year ended
December31, 2002 and $551million for the year ended
December31, 2001. Listed below are the major classes of property,
plant and equipment, their estimated useful lives, in years, and

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of its
indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
which requires the Company to evaluate the carrying value using
its fair values at least annually. To complete this evaluation,
the Company performs a comparison of the carrying amount of its
wireless license acquisition costs to the fair value of those
assets. For purposes of this comparison, it is the
Companys policy to aggregate its wireless license
acquisition costs. The Company determines the fair value of its
wireless license acquisition costs based on its estimated future
discounted cash flows. For goodwill, there is a two-step
approach for assessing impairment. The first step requires a
comparison of the fair value of the Company to its carrying
amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds
its carrying amount, then the goodwill is not deemed to be
impaired. If the estimated fair value does not exceed its
carrying value, the second step of the impairment test is
performed, which measures the amount of impairment loss. The
Company has identified impairments relating to their indefinite
life intangible assets during 2002. See Recently Issued
Accounting Pronouncements below for further details. The Company continues to account for the
impairment of its definite life assets by comparing the carrying
value of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash
flows generated by those assets whenever an event or
circumstance indicates that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the Company would
impair the carrying value for the excess amount above the fair
value.   
Wireless License Acquisition
Costs Wireless license acquisition costs consist of
amounts paid to acquire FCC licenses to provide wireless
services. Prior to the implementation of SFAS No. 142, wireless
license acquisition costs were being amortized on a
straight-line basis over fifteen years. Amortization expense of
$874million was recorded in 2001. Upon implementation of
SFAS No142, effective January1, 2002, the Company
no longer amortizes wireless license acquisition costs. Instead,
the Company is testing for the impairment of indefinite life
intangible assets at least annually and will only adjust the
carrying amount of these intangible assets upon an impairment of
the indefinite life intangible assets. During 2002, the Company identified impairments
relating to its wireless license acquisition costs, see
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements below for
further discussion.   
Goodwill In accordance with SFAS No142, the Company
is testing for the impairment of goodwill at least annually and
will only adjust the carrying amount of goodwill upon an
impairment of the goodwill. The ongoing value and remaining
useful lives of intangible and other long-term assets are
subject to periodic evaluation.   
Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs consist primarily of
fees incurred to issue long-term debt. Deferred financing costs
are being amortized over the term of the debt of eight to ten
years. Interest expense related to this amortization of
$84million was recorded in 2003, $93million in
2002, and $92million in 2001. Based on the current
expected term of the Companys long-term debt, the
estimated amortization of deferred financing costs for the next
five succeeding years is approximately $69million per
year. 53 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Continued   
Customer list Customer list consists of amounts paid to acquire
wireless customer lists. Customer list acquisition costs are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years.
Amortization expense of $206million was recorded in 2003 131million in 2002 and $132million in 2001. Based
on the remaining term of the Companys customer list, the
future estimated amortization expense is approximately
$332million in 2004, $179million in 2005 160million in 2006 and 2007 and $113million in
2008.   
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities The Company accounts for derivatives and hedging
activities in accordance with SFAS No133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activity, which requires the Company to record an asset or
liability and a transition adjustment, net of income tax
benefit, to other comprehensive income or loss for its
derivative contracts. All derivatives are recognized on the
balance sheet at their fair value. All of the Companys
derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are
cash flow hedges. The Company designates its cash
flow hedge derivatives as such on the date the derivative
contract is entered into. The Company formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transaction. The Company also
assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash
flows of hedged items. The Companys accumulated other
comprehensive loss, net of income tax benefit, was
$11million as of December31, 2002 and
$91million as of December31, 2001. The remaining
contracts expired in April2003, and were reclassified and
expensed during 2003, leaving no balance as of December31,
2003. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, there were no gains or losses
reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of
hedge accounting treatment for any of the Companys
derivatives. See Note6 for further discussion of hedge
accounting. By using derivative instruments to hedge
exposures to changes in interest rates, the Company exposes
itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the
failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the
derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging
instruments are usually placed with counterparties that the
Company believes are minimal credit risks. It is the
Companys policy to only enter into derivative contracts
with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management
to be competent and competitive market makers.   
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes service revenue over the
period it is earned. The cost of providing service is recognized
as incurred. Airtime and toll revenue are billed in arrears. The
Company accrued estimated unbilled revenue for services provided
of $100million as of December31, 2003 and
$40million as of December31, 2002, which is
included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Monthly access charges are billed in advance and
are reflected as deferred revenue on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Equipment revenue is recognized
when the equipment is delivered to the customer. Subscriber
acquisition costs primarily commissions and losses on equipment
sales are expensed as incurred.   
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and
are included as marketing and selling expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. 54 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated income tax
return. Income taxes are allocated among the various entities
included in the consolidated tax return, as agreed, based on the
ratio of each entitys taxable income lossto
consolidated taxable income loss. Deferred income taxes
reflect the estimated future tax effects of differences between
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at
year-end. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.   
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets The Company accounts for the disposal of
long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. The discontinued operations described in Note 3
are reflected in the financial statements as Loss from
Discontinued Operations.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock option plans
under APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, under which no compensation cost is recognized.

Continued The weighted average fair value of options
granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $346
in 2003, $209 in 2002 and $1569 in 2001 assuming an expected
life of ten years.   
Earnings Per Share SFAS No128, Earnings Per
Share, requires two presentations of earnings per share
basic and diluted. Basic
lossincome per share is computed by dividing
lossincome available to shareholders the numerator by
the weighted-average number of shares the denominator for the
period. The computation of diluted lossincome per share
is similar to basic loss income per share, except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional
shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially
dilutive shares, such as options, had been issued. The Companys ClassC and ClassD
common stock is convertible into 11144 shares of ClassA
common stock at the option of the holder. Due to this conversion
feature, basic lossincome per common share is computed
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding on an as converted basis for the period described. The following table reconciles the net earnings
and common shares outstanding used in the calculations of basic
and diluted net income lossper share for 2003, 2002 and

Use of Estimates The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions
include the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment;
valuations of intangible assets; valuation allowances for
receivables and inventories; assets and 56 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Continued obligations related to employee benefits; and
obligations related to acquired and sold properties. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.   
Significant Concentrations In connection with providing wireless services to
customers of other wireless carriers, the Company has
contractual agreements with those carriers, which provide for
agreed-upon billing rates between the parties. Approximately 80%
during the year ended December31, 2003, 76% during the
year ended December 31, 2002 and 78% during the year ended
December31, 2001 of the Companys roaming revenue was
earned from twowireless carriers.   
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the
previously presented 2002 and 2001 balances to conform to the
current presentation.   
Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements In July2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No141, Business Combinations and
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
These standards prohibit the application of the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business
combinations effective June30, 2001 and require companies
to cease the amortization of existing goodwill and intangible
assets with indefinite lives effective January1, 2002. As
a result of the adoption of SFAS No142, the Company
reassessed the useful lives of its intangible assets. A
significant portion of its intangible assets is classified as
Wireless license acquisition costs, which represents
the Companys costs associated with acquiring its FCC
licenses. These licenses allow the Company to provide wireless
services by giving the Company the exclusive right to utilize
certain radio frequency spectrum. Although the FCC licenses are
issued for only a fixed time, generally ten years, these
licenses are renewed by the FCC on a routine basis and for a
nominal fee. In addition, the Company has determined that there
are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or
other factors that limit the useful life of these FCC licenses.
As a result, the Companys wireless license acquisition
costs are treated as indefinite life intangible assets.
Therefore, upon implementing SFAS No142 in its entirety,
the Company ceased the amortization of both its goodwill and its
wireless license acquisition costs and now tests for impairment
of its goodwill and its wireless license acquisition costs at
least annually and only adjusts the carrying amount of these
intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill or wireless
license acquisition costs. The Company also determines on an
annual basis whether facts and circumstances continue to support
an indefinite useful life. During the year ended December31, 2001, the
Company recorded $649 million of amortization expense, net of
income tax benefit, related to its wireless license acquisition
costs. Without this amortization and before considering American
Cellulars impact of this change, the Companys 2001

In accordance with SFASNo121, the
Companys accounting policy for impairment of long-lived
assets was to review the carrying value of long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. If such circumstances were deemed to exist, the
carrying value of the asset would be compared to the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset. The
Companys definite life assets will continue to be
amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to
the same impairment criteria. As a result of fully implementing
SFAS No142 on January1, 2002, the Company is
required to evaluate the carrying value of its indefinite life
intangible assets using their fair values, at least annually. If
the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair
value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal
to that excess. Upon implementation of SFAS No142, the
Company performed a comparison of the carrying amount of its
wireless license acquisition costs to the fair value of those
assets. For purposes of this comparison, it is the
Companys policy to aggregate its wireless license
acquisition costs. The Company determined the fair value of its
wireless license acquisition costs based on its estimated future
discounted cash flows. Based on the comparison, the Company
determined that the carrying amount of its wireless license
acquisition costs exceeded their estimated fair value. As a
result, the Company recorded a charge, net of income tax
benefit, of $333million to reflect the write-down of its
wireless license acquisition costs to their fair value and a
charge of $1408million to reflect its equity in the
write-down of the wireless license acquisition costs of its then
50% owned joint venture, American Cellular to their fair values.
In addition, at June30, 2002 and continuing through
August2003, American Cellular failed to comply with the
total debt leverage ratio required by its senior credit
facility. Due to factors and circumstances impacting American
Cellular, American Cellular concluded that it was necessary to
re-evaluate the carrying value of its goodwill and its
indefinite life intangible assets in accordance with SFAS
No142. Based on these evaluations at June30, 2002
and December31, 2002, American Cellular concluded that
there were impairments of its goodwill. Therefore, American
Cellular recorded an impairment loss totaling
$3770million at June30, 2002, and an additional
impairment loss of $4239 million at December31, 2002,
bringing its total impairment loss on goodwill to
$8009million for the year ended December31, 2002.
However, after recognizing the Companys 50% interest in
Americans impairment at June30, 2002, the
Companys investment in the joint venture was written down
to zero. Therefore, the additional impairment loss at
December31, 2002, did not impact the Companys
results of operations or financial condition. In April2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4,
44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and
Technical Corrections. SFAS No145 became effective
for fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002, and upon
adoption, the Company reclassified extraordinary losses on
extinguishment of debt as a financing expense in the prior
periods that have had extraordinary losses on debt
extinguishments. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the
Company had a loss from extinguishment of debt of
$523million, see Note 6. For the year ended
December31, 2002, the Company had a gain from
extinguishment of debt of $22million, see Note 6. 58 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Continued The FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force issued
EITF 00-21: Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables, to address certain revenue
recognition issues. The guidance provided from EITF 00-21
addresses both the timing and classification in accounting for
different earnings processes. The Company adopted EITF 00-21 in
July2003 and it did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial condition or operations. In May, 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity. This statement
was effective for interim periods beginning after June15,
2003 and required that mandatorily redeemable preferred stock be
classified as a liability and any related accretion of discount
and accrual of dividends be charged to the Companys
statement of operations. Prior to June15, 2003, the
charges related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock
were not reflected in net income loss, but were reflected in
determining net income lossapplicable to common
stockholder. At December31, 2003, the carrying value of
the Companys mandatorily redeemable preferred stock was
$2533 million. The related dividends that would have been
reflected as financing expense was $405million for the
six months ended June30, 2003. Subsequent to the adoption
of SFAS No150 for the six months ended December31,
2003, the Company has reflected $306million of its
dividends as a financing expense. In accordance with the provisions of EITF Topic
D-42, as amended at the July31, 2003 EITF meeting, the
Company has reduced the gain on the redemption of preferred
stock previously reported in the fourth quarter of 2002 and
first quarter of 2003 by the pro rata portion of the respective
preferred stock issuance costs associated with the redeemed
shares. The gains on the redemptions of preferred stock were
reduced by $25million and $16million respectively,
which reduced earnings per share for the respective periods by
$003 and $002.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On February17, 2004, the Company
transferred its ownership in Maryland RSA 2 wireless property in
exchange for Cingular Wireless ownership in Michigan RSA 5
wireless property, $22million in cash and its one-percent
ownership interest in Texas RSA 2 and Oklahoma RSAs 5 and 7. The
Company is the majority owner of these three markets. The
Maryland RSA 2 property has a total population of approximately
470,700, including the cities of Ocean City, Salisbury, Easton
and Cambridge. The Michigan RSA 5 property covers a population
of approximately 169,400, including the cities of Cadillac,
Manistee, and Ludington. The exchange resulted in a net loss of
approximately 15,500 subscribers for the Company. As a result of
a definitive agreement that was entered into prior to
December31, 2003, and closed on February17, 2004,
the Company has reclassified its historical financial statements
to reflect the operation of the Maryland RSA 2 property as
discontinued operations. The Company expects to recognize a loss
of $127million, net of tax, in connection with this
exchange transaction. On February8, 2002, the Company sold
California 7 RSA, Ohio 2 RSA and Georgia 1 RSA to Verizon
Wireless for a total purchase price of $2630million, and
American Cellular sold Tennessee 4 RSA to Verizon Wireless for a
total purchase price of $2020million. In addition, On
February28, 2002, the Company completed another
transaction with Verizon Wireless in which the Company sold its
75% ownership interest in Arizona 5 RSA for a total purchase
price of $850million. Proceeds from these transactions
were used primarily to pay down bank debt. However, at
December31, 2003, $113million of these proceeds
were being held in escrow to cover any future contingencies and
are shown as restricted assets on the Companys balance
sheet. On June17, 2003, the Company exchanged its
California properties with ATT Wireless, as described
below. The Companys historical financial statements have
been reclassified to reflect the exchange of these properties
with ATT Wireless, the exchange with Cingular Wireless
described above and the sale of these properties to Verizon
Wireless as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements. 59 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

The long-term debt of the Company is recorded at
the consolidated level and is not reflected by each individual
market. Thus, the Company has allocated a portion of interest
expense to the discontinued operations based on these
markets pro rata population coverage to properly reflect
the interest that was incurred to finance the operations for
these markets. The interest expense allocated to these
operations was $52million for the year ended
December31, 2003, $130million for the year ended
December31, 2002 and $314million for the year ended
December31, 2001. The Company completed the sale of Ohio 2 RSA,
California 7 RSA and Georgia 1 RSA on February8, 2002 and
the sale of Arizona 5 RSA on February28, 2002, and
recorded income from discontinued operations totaling
$51million, net of tax expense, for the year ended
December31, 2002 and recorded the related gains on the
sale totaling $883million, net of tax expense, for the
year ended December31, 2002. The net loss from discontinued operations from
the Companys previous investment in joint venture
represents the discontinued operations from American Cellular.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On August8, 2003, American Cellular
Corporation American Cellular, a 50%-owned joint
venture of the Company, and ACC Escrow Corp., a newly formed,
wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed the
offering of $9000million aggregate principal amount of
10% senior notes due 2011. The senior notes were issued at par
by ACC Escrow Corp. ACC Escrow Corp. was merged into American
Cellular as part of the restructuring, described below and
American Cellular assumed ACC Escrow Corp.s obligations
under these senior notes. The net proceeds from the offering
were used to fully repay American Cellulars existing bank
credit facility and to pay expenses of the restructuring. DCC is
not a guarantor of these senior notes. All material subsidiaries
of American Cellular are the guarantors of these senior notes. On August19, 2003, the Company and American
Cellular completed an exchange offer for American
Cellulars existing 95% senior subordinated notes due 2009
the existing notes. This exchange offer resulted
in the restructuring of American Cellulars indebtedness
and equity ownership. As part of the American Cellular
restructuring, holders of $6819million of the $7000
million of notes tendered their notes. In exchange for the
tendered notes, the old noteholders received from the Company
439million shares of the Companys Class A common
stock, 681,900 shares of the Companys convertible
preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of
$1218million, convertible into a maximum of
139million shares of the Companys Class A common
stock, and $487million in cash. In addition, the Company
issued an additional 4,301 shares of its SeriesF
convertible preferred stock and 276,848 shares of its Class A
common stock in payment of certain fees. Upon consummation of
the restructuring, American Cellular became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. Therefore, Americans assets,
liabilities and results of operations have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financials from the date of
acquisition. 61 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

The Company acquired the remaining equity
interest in American Cellular to continue the Companys
strategy of owning rural and suburban wireless telecommunication
service areas. As a result of the acquisition, the Company
increased the number of service areas in which it is licensed to
offer services and increased the number of its subscribers. The
Company previously managed the operations of American Cellular
under an arrangement with its joint venture partner. Prior to the restructuring, American Cellular had
net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately
$320million. The restructuring transactions resulted in
the reduction of approximately $200million of those NOL
carryforwards. After the restructuring, approximately
$120million of NOL carryforwards remain available to
American Cellular. However, the restructuring also resulted in
an ownership change within the meaning of the Internal Revenue
Code Section382 and the regulations thereunder. This
ownership change limits the amount of previously generated NOL
carryforwards that American Cellular can utilize to offset
future taxable income. American Cellular has reviewed the need
for a valuation allowance against these NOL carryforwards. Based
on a review of taxable income, history and trends, forecasted
taxable income, expiration of carryforwards and limitations on
the annual use of the carryforwards, American Cellular has not
provided a valuation allowance for the NOL carryforwards because
management believes that it is 62 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 4.BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:
Continued more likely than not that all of the NOL
carryforwards of American Cellular will be realized prior to
their expiration. On June17, 2003, the Company transferred
its two remaining wireless properties in California to ATT
Wireless in exchange for its two wireless properties in Alaska,
and all of the outstanding shares of its SeriesAA
preferred stock that it previously held, which, the Company then
cancelled. The cost of the acquired Alaska assets was
$1260million. As part of the exchange agreements, the
Company and ATT Wireless agreed to make or receive a
payment based on relative working capital balances for the
affected markets. The Company estimated a payment of
$102million would be required, $87 million of this
estimate has been paid, which leaves an estimate of $15 million
remaining. The Company has determined a preliminary purchase
price allocation and will finalize in future periods when the
determination of final tax basis assumed is completed. The
Alaska assets, liabilities and results of operations have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financials from the
date of acquisition. The Company has reclassified its financial
statements to reflect the operations of its California
properties as discontinued operations, see Note 3 above. The above business combinations are accounted for
as purchases. Accordingly, the related statement of financial
positions and their results of operations have been included in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the
date of acquisition. The unaudited pro forma information set
forth below includes all business combinations that occurred
during 2003, as if the combinations occurred at the beginning of

Subsequent to December31, 2003, the Company
transferred its ownership in Maryland RSA2 wireless
property in exchange for Cingular Wireless ownership in
Michigan RSA5. The Company is accounting for the exchange
as a sale of Maryland RSA2 and a purchase of Michigan
RSA5. The Maryland RSA2 property has a total
population of approximately 470,700, including the cities of
Ocean City, Salisbury, Easton and Cambridge. The Michigan
RSA5 property covers a population of approximately
169,400, including the cities of Cadillac, Manistee, and
Ludington. The exchange resulted in a net loss of approximately
15,500 subscribers for the Company. As part of the transaction,
Cingular Wireless paid the Company $22million in cash and
transferred to the Company its one-percent ownership interest in
Texas RSA2 and Oklahoma RSAs5 and7. The
Company is the majority owner of these three markets. On December23, 2003, the Company entered
into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of NPI for
approximately $28million. NPI owns PCS licenses covering a
total population of 12million. Its GSM network currently
covers a total population of 10million in northern
Michigan. NPI has approximately 35,000 subscribers. This
transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004
and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions. 63 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT
VENTURE Through August18, 2003, the Company owned a
50% interest in a joint venture that owned American Cellular.
This investment was accounted for on the equity method.
Beginning on June30, 2002 and continuing through
August2003, American Cellular failed to comply with a
financial covenant in its senior credit facility, which required
that American Cellular not exceed a certain total debt leverage
ratio. Due to factors and circumstances impacting American
Cellular, American Cellular concluded that it was necessary to
re-evaluate its carrying value of its goodwill and indefinite
life intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Based on
re-evaluations, American Cellular concluded that there was an
impairment of its goodwill at June30, 2002 and
December31, 2002. As a result, American Cellular
recognized an impairment loss totaling $3770million, at
June30, 2002, and an additional impairment loss of
$4239million, at December31, 2002. After
recognizing its 50% interest of the impairment at June30,
2002, the Companys investment in the joint venture was
written down to zero. Therefore, the additional impairment loss
of $4239million at December31, 2002, did not impact
the Companys results of operations or financial condition.
The Company did not guarantee any of American Cellulars
obligations. The following is a summary of the significant
financial information for joint venture and its subsidiary,
American Cellular, as of December31, 2002, and for the

$2796million remaining of term loan facilities consisting
of a Term A facility of $1302million, a Term B Facility
of $807million and an additional Term B Facility of
$687million. On September26, 2003, the Company used
a portion of the net proceeds of its offering of
$650million 8875% senior notes to repay all amounts
outstanding under this credit facility, as described below. This
prepayment resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of
$110million, due to the write off of related deferred
financing costs   
Sygnet Wireless Credit
Facility The Companys indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary, Sygnet Wireless, was a party to a secured credit
agreement for an aggregate of $2671million, consisting of
a $34million revolving credit facility and

in connection with the offering of $650 million 8875% senior
notes, as described below, $2131million of this credit
facility was repaid. On October24, 2003, the Company
repaid the remaining balance of this credit facility, as
described below. For the year ended December31, 2003, this
prepayment resulted in a loss from extinguishment of debt of
$210million, due to the write off of related deferred
financing costs.   
Dobson/ Sygnet Senior Notes The Companys subsidiary, Dobson/ Sygnet,
had outstanding $2000million aggregate principal amount

DCC Senior Notes On September26, 2003, the Company completed
its offering of $650million aggregate principal amount of
8875% senior notes due 2013. The net proceeds from the
offering, together with borrowings under a new $700million
credit facility that was obtained by the Companys
wholly-owned subsidiary, DCS, in October2003, were used to
refinance and replace the existing credit facilities of the
Companys subsidiaries, to fund the repurchase of
$1833million principal amount of Dobson/ Sygnets
1225% senior notes, to fund the repurchase of 246,967 shares of
the Companys 1225% senior exchangeable preferred stock
having an aggregate liquidation preference of
$2483million, and for general corporate purposes.
American Cellular is an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of
the Companys 8875% senior notes. The 8875% senior notes
contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit
the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, pay
dividends or distributions on equity, purchase or redeem junior
securities and make certain investments, place restrictions on
distributions and other payments from restricted subsidiaries,
sell assets, create or incur liens, merge or consolidate with or
transfer substantial assets to another entity, engage in

American Cellular Senior
Notes On August8, 2003, ACC Escrow Corp., a newly
formed, wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of the Company,
completed the offering of $9000million aggregate
principal amount of 10% senior notes due 2011. The senior notes
were issued at par on August8, 2003, by ACC Escrow Corp.
ACC Escrow Corp. merged into American Cellular as part of the
restructuring. The net proceeds from the offering were used to
fully repay American Cellulars existing bank credit
facility and to pay expenses of the restructuring. DCC is not a
guarantor of these senior notes. All material subsidiaries of
American Cellular are guarantors of these senior notes. The

transactions, $700million principal amount of 95% senior
subordinated notes due 2009 at a discount of $69million.
The discount was being amortized over the life of 66 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued 6.LONG-TERM DEBT: Continued the notes. As part of the restructuring of
American Cellular, holders of $6819million outstanding
principal amount of these senior notes received approximately
$487million in cash, 439million shares of newly
issued shares of the Companys Class A common stock, and
681,900 shares of a new series of the Companys convertible
preferred stock, which has an aggregate liquidation preference
of approximately $1218million and is convertible into a
maximum of 139million shares of the Companys Class
A common stock. There remains outstanding $181million
liquidation value of American Cellulars 95% senior
subordinated notes.   
DCS Credit Facility On October23, 2003, the Company caused
Sygnet Wireless, its parent, Dobson/ Sygnet Communications
Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sygnet Communications,
Inc., to be merged with and into the Companys
wholly-owned subsidiary, DCS, and caused DOC LLC immediately
thereafter to terminate its revolving credit facility and
replace it with a new senior secured credit facility consisting
of   
a 6-year $1500million senior secured
revolving credit facility, and
a 65-year $5500million senior secured
term loan facility.
The DCS credit facility is guaranteed by the
Company, DOC LLC and each of DCSs direct subsidiaries and
is secured by a first priority security interest in all of the
tangible and intangible assets of DCS. The DCS credit facility
is not guaranteed by American Cellular or any of its
subsidiaries. Interest on the DCS credit facility is currently
based on a LIBOR formula plus a spread. The weighted average
interest rate for the year ended December31, 2003, was
50%. At December31, 2003, the Company had
$5486million outstanding under the term loan of this
credit facility, and the Company had the entire
$1500million of the revolving credit facility available. Under specified terms and conditions, including
covenant compliance, the amount available under the DCS credit
facility may be increased by an incremental facility of up to
$2000million. The Company has the right to make no more
than four requests to increase the amount of the credit facility
and with respect to the revolving credit facility, it must be
made at least 12 months prior to the credit termination date and
with respect to the term loan facility, it must be made within
30months of the closing date. Any incremental facility
will have a maturity greater than the weighted average life of
the existing debt under the DCS credit facility. Under the DCS credit facility there are mandatory
scheduled principal or amortization payments of the term loan
facility and no reductions in commitments under the revolving
credit facility. The term loan facility will amortize 1% per
annum for the first 55years and in equal quarterly
installments for the balance in the final year. The revolving
credit facility is scheduled to mature in April2009 and
the term loan facility is scheduled to mature in
April2010. However, if the Company has not refinanced or
repaid its 10875% senior notes by January31, 2010, then
the term loan facility will mature on January31, 2010. DCS also is required to make mandatory reductions
of the credit facility with the net cash proceeds received from
certain issuances of debt and equity and upon any material sale
of assets by DCS and its subsidiaries. The DCS credit agreement contains covenants that,
subject to specified exceptions, limit the Companys
ability to   
make capital expenditures;
sell or dispose of assets;
incur additional debt;

Interest Rate Hedges The Company pays interest on its bank credit
facilities at a variable factor, based on a LIBOR formula plus a
spread. The Company will from time-to-time enter into derivative
contracts to reduce exposure against changes in interest rates. The Company had a $1350million derivative
contract on the credit facility of its wholly-owned subsidiary,
DOC LLC, whereby the interest rate was fixed at 69%, plus a
factor based on DOC LLCs leverage. This derivative
contract expired in April2003. The Company had a
$1900million derivative contract on the credit facility
of its wholly-owned subsidiary, DOC LLC, whereby the interest
rate was fixed at 65%, plus a factor based on DOC LLCs
leverage. This derivative contract expired in October2002.
Additionally, the Company previously entered into a
$3000million derivative contract on the DOC LLC credit
facility whereby the interest rate had a cap of 85% plus a
factor based on DOC LLCs leverage, this derivative
contract expired on March13, 2002. On January1, 2001, the Company implemented
SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activity. With this implementation, the
Company began recording a liability and a transition adjustment,
net of income tax benefit, to other comprehensive loss during
2001 in connection with these derivative contracts. The
Companys accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of
income tax benefit, was $11million at December31,
2002. These contracts were reclassified and expensed during 2003.   
Debt of DCCLP On May19, 2003, the Companys
principal stockholder DCCLP, entered into an agreement with Bank
of America to amend and restructure DCCLPs loan. The
agreement eliminates the change of control risk to the Company
related to possible future default on the DCCLP loan. Under the
new five-year loan agreement, the amount owed by DCCLP to Bank
of America has been reduced to $60 million, with interest
payable at Bank of Americas prime interest rate. Under the
terms of the agreement, DCCLP transferred 325million
shares of the Companys ClassA common stock to Bank
of America. During the fourth quarter 2003, Bank of America had
sold all of the Companys ClassA common stock that it
had acquired from DCCLP.

requirements for certain capital leases the Company entered into
during 2002 and 2001 for furniture and office equipment. These
capital leases have anywhere from a three to five year lease
term and offer a bargain purchase price at the end of the lease
term. The depreciation related to these assets is included in
the Companys depreciation expense and the obligation is
included in the Companys other non-current liabilities.   
Commitments The Company and its subsidiary, American
Cellular, entered into an equipment supply agreement in which
the Company agreed to purchase approximately $1500 million of
cell site and switching equipment between November16, 2001
and July 15, 2005, to update the wireless systems for existing
MSAs and RSAs. This commitment was fulfilled as of
September30, 2003.   
Contingencies The Company is party to various other legal
actions arising in the normal course of business. None of the
actions are believed by management to involve amounts that would
be material to the Companys consolidated financial
position, results of operation, or liquidity. 75 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

operations.   
Stock Option Plans The Company adopted its 1996 stock option plan
the 1996 plan, its 2000 stock option plan the
2000 plan and its 2002 stock option plan the
2002 plan to encourage its key employees by
providing opportunities to participate in the ownership and
future growth through the grant of incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options. The plans also permit the grant of
options to its directors. The Companys compensation
committee presently administers the 1996, 2000 and 2002 plans.
The Company expects to grant any future options pursuant to the
2000 or 2002 plan and does not expect to grant any additional
options under the 1996 plan. The Company accounts for the plans
under APB Opinion 25, under which no compensation cost is
recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
if the option price is equal to or greater than the fair market
value of the stock at the time the option is granted. Under the 1996 plan, the Board of Directors
granted both incentive and non-incentive stock options for
employees, officers and directors to acquire ClassC common
stock and ClassD common stock, which is convertible into
shares of ClassA common stock at a 11144 to 1 basis at
the time of exercise. Options granted under the 2000 and 2002
stock incentive plan can also be both incentive and
non-incentive stock options for employees, officers and
directors, however, all shares granted under these plans are
shares of ClassA common stock. Under all the plans, stock options have been
issued at the market price on the date of grant with an
expiration of ten years from the grant date. All options issued
under the 1996 and 2000 plans vest at a rate of 20% per year and
all options issued under the 2002 vest at a rate of 25% per
year. The maximum number of shares for which the Company may
grant options under the 2000 plan is 4,000,000 shares of
ClassA common stock and the maximum number under the 2002
plan is 7,000,000 shares of ClassA common stock, subject
to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, reorganization or certain defined change of
control events. As of December31, 2003, the Company had
outstanding options to purchase 5,759,252 shares of ClassA
common stock to approximately 100 employees, officers and
directors. Shares subject to previously expired, cancelled,
forfeited or terminated options become available again for
grants of options. The shares that the Company will issue under
the plan will be newly issued shares, or shares held as treasury
shares. In July2003, the Companys Board of
Directors adopted and approved a plan whereby options granted
under the 2000 Plan could, at the election of the option holder,
be exchanged for a specified number of new options to be granted
no sooner than January2004. The period to make the
election to exchange these options ended on July29, 2003.
Any new options to be granted would be subject to the same
vesting schedule as the surrendered options. As of July29, 2003, all eligible option
holders had elected to surrender their old options. Options
totaling 2,405,000 shares were surrendered by a total of 65
option holders. Stock options outstanding under the Plans are
presented for the periods indicated. In addition, all options
are presented on an as converted basis since all
shares are converted to ClassA common stock upon
exercising. 79 Table of Contents DOBSON COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND

At December31, 2003, the Company had NOL
carryforwards of approximately $795million, which may be
utilized to reduce future Federal income taxes payable. These
NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2019. Certain of the
Companys NOL carryforwards are subject to limitation,
under I.R.C. section382. The Company expects the annual
limitation under I.R.C. section382 to be $200million. The Company periodically reviews the need for a
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and recognizes
these assets. Based on a review of taxable income, history and
trends, forecasted taxable income and expiration of
carryforwards, the Company has provided a valuation allowance
for certain of its deferred tax assets.
