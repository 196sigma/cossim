To the Stockholders of I-Sector Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of I-Sector
Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of I-Sector Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003, and the results of their operations

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
I-Sector Corporation and subsidiaries I-Sector or the Company are
engaged in the business of providing computer services and of selling associated
hardware and telephony software products in the United States and abroad.
I-Sector operates through three wholly-owned subsidiaries   - Internetwork Experts, Inc. INX is a network professional services and
integration organization with areas of practice that include large-scale
enterprise network engineering consulting, network security, network
management, wireless networking and IP telephony.
- Stratasoft, Inc. Stratasoft creates and markets software related to
the integration of computer and telephone technologies.
- Valerent, Inc. Valerent provides information technology solutions
that lowers its client expense by utilizing centralized, remote enabled
computing management tools which predict, announce and manage service
interruptions. Additionally Valerent provides customers with traditional
computer services such as on-site and carry-in computer repair,
application support, operating system and network migration services,
turn-key outsourced IT helpdesk solutions, technical staff augmentation
for IT helpdesk operations, helpdesk solutions consulting services.
I-Sector significant accounting policies are as follows   Principles of Consolidation -- The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of I-Sector and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Inventory -- Inventory consists primarily of Cisco network equipment,
Stratasoft dialers, computer equipment and components and is valued at the lower
of cost or market with cost determined on the first-in first-out method.
Substantially all of I-Sector inventory is finished goods. The Company records
write downs of its inventory to net realizable value as appropriate.
Property and Equipment -- Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred,
while expenditures for betterments are capitalized. Disposals are removed at
cost less accumulated depreciation with the resulting gain or loss reflected in
operations in the year of disposal.
Intangible Assets -- Intangible assets are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives of five to sixteen years see Note 12.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets -- I-Sector records impairment losses on
long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that
the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets.
Income Taxes -- I-Sector accounts for income taxes under the liability
method, which requires, among other things, recognition of deferred income tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in I-Sector consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and the
recognition of available tax carryforwards.
Reclassifications -- Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated
financial statements presented herein have been reclassified to conform to
current period presentation.
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of the financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
48
I-SECTOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition -- I-Sector has a number of different revenue
components, which vary between its reportable operating segments. Each
reportable operating segment has more than one revenue component, and revenue is
recognized differently for each component or stream of revenue earned by
operating segment. The material revenue streams earned by I-Sector, some of
which are earned by more than one operating segment, and some by only one
operating segment, are      Products Revenue. Three of I-Sector operating segments earn revenue
from product shipments. Product shipment revenue occurs when products
manufactured by other parties are purchased and resold to a customer and
such products are contracted for independently of material services.
I-Sector recognizes revenue from product shipments when the product is
shipped or delivered to the customer. In all three segments, the four
criteria for revenue recognition have been met because: 1 there are
written, executed contracts, or in the case of INX and Valerent, in some
situations there are binding purchase orders; 2 delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered. Stratasoft, however, recognizes revenue on the
percentage of completion method, as described below; 3 the price is fixed
or determinable, and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured. Each of
I-Sector business segments perform credit research prior to extending
credit. In Stratasoft business segment, a substantial portion of the
total contract price is received in cash or letter of credit when the unit
is installed.
Services Revenue. All of I-Sector operating segments earn revenue
from providing stand-alone service revenue. This revenue consists of
billings for engineering and technician time, programming services, which
are provided on either a hourly basis or a flat-fee basis, support
contracts and the service component of maintenance and repair service
ticket transactions. These services are contracted for separately from any
product sale, and generally for contracts of short duration are recognized
when the service is performed and when collection is reasonably assured.
Two of I-Sector segments sometimes earn agency fee revenue from various
sources, the primary source of which is referring customers to other
organizations for which an agency fee is received. This revenue is
recognized at the earlier of when payment is received or when notification
of amounts being due is received from the entity paying such agency fee and
collectibility is reasonably assured.
INX has certain fixed and flat fee contracts that extend over three
months or more, and are accounted for on the percentage of completion
method of accounting. The percentage of revenue recognized in any
particular period is determined on the basis of the relationship of the
actual hours worked to estimated total hours to complete the contract.
Revisions of the estimated hours to complete are reflected in the period in
which the facts necessitating the revisions become known. When a contract
indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss.
Custom Project Revenue. Stratasoft earns revenue from projects that
are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting for
such revenue. The majority of Stratasoft revenue consists of system sales
in which it bundles its proprietary software, along with third-party
hardware products and related software customization services,
installation, training services, warranty services and incidental post
contract support PCS together under a single contract with the
customer. PCS is insignificant on such contracts for one year or less, and
therefore, we have determined that the value of such PCS should not be
unbundled from the project revenue as set forth in paragraph 59 of SOP
97-2. Accordingly, such PCS revenue is recognized together with the project
revenue, and the estimated cost to provide the PCS is accrued. The value of
the PCS is determinable within the contract, which defines the period that
the PCS is granted and offers renewals at stated amounts, thereby defining
the value of the PCS. The software customization, together with the
hardware customization and integration, represent a significant
modification, customization and/or production of the product and,
therefore, the entire
49
I-SECTOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
arrangement is required to be accounted for using the percentage of
completion method of accounting pursuant to SOP 81-1. The percentage of
revenue recognized in any particular period is determined principally on
the basis of the relationship of the cost of work performed on the contract
to estimated total costs. The percentage-of-completion method relies on
estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs. We follow this
method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs
applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Revisions of
estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts necessitating the
revisions become known. When a contract indicates a loss, a provision is
made for the total anticipated loss. The following reflects the amounts
relating to uncompleted contracts at                                DECEMBER 31,  DECEMBER 31,

$ 634     $1,190
During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company recorded
adjustments to defer revenue for certain custom projects that had more than
one year of free PCS and certain renewals of PCS paid in advance. The
adjustment includes approximately $152 related to years prior to 2003.
Management determined that the effect of these adjustments was not material
to the previously reported results or to the results expected for 2003.
During December 2003 I-Sector operating segment Stratasoft sold $408
of software products to a reseller for which the related revenue was
deferred at December 31, 2003. Revenue from this sale will be recognized in
the accounting periods that payments from the reseller become due, or in
the accounting period when it has been firmly established that the software
has been re-sold to an end-user of the software and that collection is
reasonably assured by the Company.
During 2001, 2002 and 2003, I-Sector has recognized revenue of $2,251,
$614 and $502, respectively, on the percentage-of-completion basis for
several projects associated with one reseller in South Asia. For these
projects, Stratasoft entered into a three-party contract between
Stratasoft, the South Asia reseller and the end-user customers. Stratasoft
was responsible for performing the substantial majority of the project for
the end-user customer, from whom Stratasoft was directly obligated to be
paid for such project by the end-user customer.
Credit Risk -- The Company extends credit to its customers in the normal
course of business and generally does not require collateral or other security.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and, in some instances, requires letters of credit or additional
guarantees in support of contracted amounts. Earnings are charged with a
provision for doubtful accounts based on a current review of the collectibility
of the accounts and using a systematic approach based on historical collections
and age of the amounts due. Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against
the allowance for doubtful accounts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Vendor Incentives -- From time to time, the Company participates in
programs provided by suppliers that enable it to earn incentives. These
incentives are generally earned by sales volume, sales growth and customer
satisfaction levels. The amounts earned under these programs are recorded as a
reduction of cost of goods when earned and determinable. The amount of vendor
incentives recognized can vary significantly between quarterly and annual
periods.
Advertising Costs -- Advertising costs consist of print advertising and
trade show materials and are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs for the
year ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 were $334, $370 and $323,
respectively.
Research and Development Costs -- Expenditures relating to the development
of new products and processes, including significant improvements and
refinements to existing products, are expensed as incurred.
Warranty Reserve -- I-Sector records a warranty reserve related to certain
software products sold by its Stratasoft subsidiary. That reserve is classified
in accrued expenses and is amortized over the life of the warranty, which is
generally twelve months, against actual warranty expenditures. This warranty
reserve relates to the estimate of warranty obligations from sales of
Stratasoft call center telephony systems, which consist of Stratasoft
software, configured hardware components as well as telephone support relating
to Stratasoft software products. This liability amount has been consistently
recorded within each period as a charge to cost of goods based upon five percent
of period revenue. This percentage was based upon a review of the costs of
providing the warranty work, which was initially performed in connection with
the acquisition of the Stratasoft technology. Stratasoft incurs numerous types
of costs related to the warranty work, which includes labor cost of technicians
and programmers, hardware cost, the cost of developing and uploading software
patches related to bug fixes, telephone support, and hardware parts cost
related to defective hardware sold as a part of a complete Stratasoft system.
The majority of these costs are individually insignificant amounts for which the
cost/benefit relationship does not warrant tracking, but which we periodically
assess and continue to estimate at approximately five percent of Stratasoft
sales. As the actual costs are not tracked, Stratasoft amortizes the recorded
amounts to cost of goods over the average life of the contractual warranty
period as costs are believed to be incurred ratably over the warranty period.
The difference between the actual warranty costs incurred and the amount of
amortization is not considered to be materially different. The following table
depicts the activity in the warranty reserve                                DECEMBER 31,

Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company has elected to account for employee
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method of accounting in
accordance with Accounting Principles Bulletin APB No. 25 Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. Under this method no compensation expense is
recognized when the number of shares granted is known and the exercise price of
the stock option is equal to or greater than the fair value of the common stock
on the grant date. The Company has recorded no stock-based compensation
associated with stock options granted to employees and directors in its
consolidated statement of operations. I-Sector and its subsidiaries apply the
fair value method as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, as interpreted and amended, for
stock and stock options issued to non-employees and during the year ended
December 31, 2003, recorded $337 of other additional paid in capital related to
compensation to the non-employees. If compensation cost for all option issuances
had been determined consistent with the

fair value method, I-Sector net loss and net loss per share would have
increased to the pro-forma amounts indicated below.
For purposes of estimating the fair value disclosures below, the fair value
of each stock option has been estimated on the grant date with a Black-Scholes
option pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions for the
2001, 2002 and 2003 periods; dividend yield of 0% for all periods; expected
volatility of 59%, 821% and 857%, respectively; risk-free interest rate of
55%, 363% and 363%, respectively; and expected lives of 80, 757 and 84
years, respectively, from the original date of the stock option grants.                                   DECEMBER 31,

of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods.
Diluted net income per share is computed based upon the weighted-average number
of common shares plus the assumed issuance of common shares for all potentially
dilutive securities using the treasury stock method See Note 6.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments -- I-Sector financial instruments
consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable
for which the carrying values approximate fair values given the short-term
maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of the Company debt
instruments approximate their fair value based on estimates of rates offered to
the Company for instruments with the same maturity dates and security
structures.
Cash and Cash Equivalents -- Cash and cash equivalents include any highly
liquid securities with an original maturity of three months or less when
purchased.
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145, among other things,
amends SFAS No. 4 and SFAS No. 64, to require that gains and losses from the
extinguishments of debt generally be classified within continuing operations.
The provisions of SFAS No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
May 15, 2002 and early application is encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS No.
145 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of this statement had no impact on the
financial statements.
52
I-SECTOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 replaces Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF Issue 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity. This standard
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal
activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an
exit or disposal plan. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. The
adoption of this statement had no impact on the financial statements.
In February 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation: Transition and Disclosure -- An Amendment of FASB Statement No.
123. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition
for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure
provisions of that Statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects
on reported net income of an entity accounting policy decisions with respect
to stock-based compensation. The statement also amends APB Opinion No. 28,
Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in
interim financial information. The Company has chosen not to voluntarily change
to the fair value based methods of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation but has adopted the disclosure rules of SFAS 148.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and
clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special
reporting in the statement of cash flows and amends certain other existing
pronouncements, resulting in more consistent reporting of contracts that are
derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant
separate accounting. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
modified after June 30, 2003. The Company does not believe that the adoption of
SFAS No. 149 will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities -- An Interpretation of ARB No.
51. FIN 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities. This Interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal
year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired
before February 1, 2003. On December 17, 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R,
providing a deferral of the application of FIN 46 for interests held by public
entities in a variable interest entity or potential variable interest entity
until fiscal periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Company has not fully
assessed the impact of FIN 46 on its financial statements, particularly its
relationship with Allstar Equities, Inc., but the adoption of this statement is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on EITF Issue 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF 00-21 addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a
vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue-generating
activities. Issue 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in
fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not
have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
In August 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF 03-05, Applicability
of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an
Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software. EITF 03-05 requires
revenue recognition under SOP 97-2 for all arrangements in which the software
sold is essential to the functionality of the hardware. The adoption of the EITF
03-05 had no impact on the Company financial statements.

2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On November 6, 2001, I-Sector approved a plan to sell or close its IT
Staffing business. This is the measurement date. A sale was finalized effective
December 31, 2001. Under the terms of the sale, I-Sector received a note
receivable for $52, $50 for the ongoing operations of IT Staffing, Inc. and $2
for certain fixed assets of I-Sector. The note receivable bears interest at 5%
per annum and is collectible in installments based on the total monthly revenue
of the buyer over 24 months beginning in April 2002. A disposal loss, including
an estimate of the operating results from the measurement date, November 6, 2001
to the closing date of the sale of $17, and estimates for impairment of assets
caused by the disposal decision of $43, totaling $9 net of tax of $5 was
recognized in 2001. Additional loss on disposal of $13 net of tax of $7 was
recognized in 2002. Net loss from discontinued operations was $167 and $0 net
of tax of $85 and $0 in 2001 and 2002, respectively. I-Sector retained accounts
receivable of approximately $82 and $0, net of reserves at December 31, 2001 and
2002, fixed assets of $52 and liabilities related to the IT Staffing business at
December 31, 2001. Fixed assets were redeployed in the continuing operations.
The balance sheet caption Liabilities related to discontinued operations
contains $36 and $0 of estimated future expenses relating to the wind-up of the
IT Staffing business at December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Revenue for
the IT Staffing business for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $967; there
was no revenue subsequent to 2001.
Prior to 2001, I-Sector sold two other businesses that have contributed to
discontinued operations in subsequent periods. In 1999, I-Sector decided to sell
both its computer products reselling business and its PBX telephone systems
dealer business, which together accounted for approximately 90% of total revenue
at the time. I-Sector closed the sale of its PBX telephone systems dealer
business, its Telecom Systems division, on March 16, 2000 and closed the sale of
its computer products reselling business, its Computer Products division, on May
19, 2000.
During the periods specified below, I-Sector recognized a gain on disposal,
net of income tax provision, of these three businesses as follows                                YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

future expenses related to the winding up of the IT Staffing business, the
Telecom Division and the Computer Products Division, and includes amounts
related to settlement of pending litigation and to Telecom warranties. In 2003
the Company settled liabilities of $285 and revised estimates of liabilities
related to discontinued operations by $62. The liability at December 31, 2003,
relates primarily to the estimated cost to settle pending litigation.

Kingdom, Germany, Greece, India, Egypt, the Philippines and Grenada.
6. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the
weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period and the assumed
exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants less the number of treasury

The potentially dilutive options of 0; 101,318 and 215,395 for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, were not used in the
calculation of diluted earnings since the effect of potentially dilutive
securities in computing a loss per share is antidilutive.
The potentially dilutive options of the Company wholly-owned subsidiary,
Internetwork Experts, Inc., see Note 14 did not impact the calculation of
I-Sector earnings per share for 2001 and 2002 since the effect would have been
antidilutive. In 2003, net loss from continuing operations for purposes of
computing the diluted loss per share increased $29 for the assumed exercise of
INX options under the treasury method.                                DECEMBER 31,

7. DEBT
On September 27, 2001, Stratasoft, a subsidiary of I-Sector, signed a note
payable to a third party for $725, payable in monthly installments through
February 2007. The note does not bear interest and I-Sector has imputed interest
at 55% to record the debt and related patent license asset and has recorded
interest of $9, $30 and $17 in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. This note is
collateralized by Stratasoft patent license assets and Stratasoft has granted
a security interest in its pending patent application and the next two patent
applications filed by Stratasoft. In connection with this note payable, I-Sector
has short-term debt maturing within one year of $68 and long-term debt of $184
at December 31, 2003.
In October 2001, I-Sector signed a non-interest bearing note payable for
$39 payable in monthly installments through October 2004. In connection with
this note payable, I-Sector has short-term debt maturing within one year of $10
at December 31, 2003.
In December 2003, I-Sector signed a 36 month non-cancelable capital lease
for the purchase of equipment. I-Sector imputed interest at 10% to record the
debt on which I-Sector has recorded $0 interest in

2003. In connection with this capital lease, I-Sector has recorded short-term
debt maturing within one year of $18 and long-term debt of $45 at December 31,
2003.
In connection with its credit agreement for the purchase of inventory
discussed immediately below, $1,688 of the outstanding balance on such credit
line was interest bearing at December 31, 2003 and is reflected as short-term
debt in the accompanying balance sheet.
On January 31, 2002, I-Sector entered into a credit agreement with Textron
Financial Corporation Textron for a revolving line of credit the Textron
Facility. The total credit available under the Textron facility, as amended,
was $7,500 subject to borrowing base limitations that are generally computed as
80% of eligible accounts receivable, and 90% of identifiable inventory purchased
under this agreement and 40% of all other inventory. The borrowing base
limitations restrict the eligibility of accounts receivable for
collateralization by disallowing as eligible any customer receivables in their
entirety that have balances over 90 days old and that exceed 25% of their total
balance. In November 2003 Textron agreed to increase the credit facility from
$7,500 to $10,000. The facility would increase to $15,000 upon the execution of
syndication loan documents and an activation of syndication for $5,000 with
Silicon Valley Bank. In February 2004, the syndication loan documents were
executed and the credit line increase to $15,000 became effective. Inventory
floor plan borrowings are reflected in accounts payable in the accompanying
balance sheets, except for $1,688 that is interest bearing and is reflected in
short term debt in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2003.
Borrowings accrue interest at the prime rate 40% at December 31, 2003 plus
25% on outstanding balances that extend beyond the vendor approved free
interest period. This agreement is collateralized by substantially all of
I-Sector assets except its patent license assets. The loan documents contain
restrictive covenants measured at each quarter end and effective at December 31,
2003, which requires us to maintain minimum tangible capital funds, maintain
minimum debt to tangible capital funds ratio, and effective at March 31, 2004,
to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio. At December 31, 2003 I-Sector was in
compliance with those loan covenants effective at that date and anticipates that
it will be able to comply with its loan covenants prospectively. In the event
I-Sector does not maintain compliance, it would be required to seek waivers from
Textron and Silicon Valley Bank for those events, which, if not obtained, could
accelerate repayment and require I-Sector to seek other sources of finance. At
December 31, 2003, I-Sector had $7,608 outstanding on inventory floor plan
finance borrowings, and the remaining credit availability was $2,392.
The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under all credit line
arrangements in effect during, 2001, 2002 and 2003 was 0%, 0% and 673 respectively. Interest expense on all credit lines was $0, $0 and $29 for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.
The aggregate amounts of installments due by calendar year on long-term
debt at December 31, 2003 are as follows

I-SECTOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
At December 31, 2003, I-Sector has a net operating loss NOL carryforward
for federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately $2,372. Since United
States tax laws limit the time during which an NOL may be applied against future
taxable income and tax liabilities, I-Sector may not be able to take full
advantage of its NOL carryforward for federal income tax purposes. The
carryforward will expire in 2023 if not otherwise used. A change in ownership,
as defined by federal income tax regulations, could significantly limit
I-Sector ability to utilize its carryforward.
During 2003, a significant number of non-qualified options were exercised
creating an excess income tax benefit for I-Sector. This benefit will be
utilized to the extent that I-Sector has tax basis income that was not offset by
net operating loss NOL carryforwards. At December 31, 2003, approximately $243
of the valuation allowance has been attributed to excess benefit due to
options. The company will use this portion only when the valuation allowance
has been reduced by $564. Any tax benefit that is realized in subsequent years
from the reduction of the valuation allowance established related to these
options will be recorded as an expense and additional paid-in capital.
On March 9, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Job Creation and
Worker Assistance Act of 2002. The law provides for the carryback of net
operating losses for any taxable year ending during 2001 and 2002 to each of the
5 tax years preceding the loss year. Previously, a net operating loss was only
eligible to be carried back to the 2 years preceding the year of loss. As a
result of the change in the carryback period, I-Sector recognized a tax benefit
of $1,459 and $73 in the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively.
On July 26, 2002 the Company received $1,123 in tax refunds. Additionally, on
July 24, 2003 the Company received $561 in tax refunds.

Litigation -- In August 2002, Inacom Corp. Inacom filed a lawsuit in
the District Court of Douglas County, Nebraska styled Inacom Corp v. I-Sector
Corporation, f/k/a Allstar Systems, Inc., claiming that I-Sector owed the sum of
approximately $570 to Inacom as a result of Inacom termination of a Vendor
Purchase Agreement between Inacom and I-Sector. I-Sector believes that the claim
is without merit and intends to vigorously contest the demand.
I-Sector had filed a claim to collect on a note receivable from E Z Talk
Communications E Z Talk and had entered into arbitration discussions with E
Z Talk. In July 2002, E Z Talk filed a lawsuit to set aside the arbitration and
claiming damages of $250. On March 7, 2003, the parties settled with E Z Talk
paying $25 over 5 months from April 2003 through August 2003 and agreeing to
release all equipment back to I-Sector

90 days after the final payment. All payments have been made with the last
payment occurring on August 22, 2003.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC filed a Charge of
Discrimination against Stratasoft on behalf of a former employee on August 1,
2002 in the EEOC Minneapolis, Minnesota office. Stratasoft reached agreement to
settle this claim, without admitting or denying, in September 2003 for $130, and
general and administrative expense of $130 was recognized in the year ended
December 31, 2003.
In March 2003, I-Sector and other parties were notified of a demand for
return of payments relating to the business activities of a call center
customer. In March 2004, I-Sector was informed by the claimant that claims will
not be pursued at this time. I-Sector believes that the claims against it, if
re-initiated, are without merit and intends to vigorously contest any demands
related to this matter.
I-Sector is also party to other litigation and claims which management
believes are normal in the course of its operations. While the results of such
litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, I-Sector believes the
final outcome of such matters will not have a materially adverse effect on its
results of operations or financial position.
Leases -- I-Sector leases office space from Allstar Equities, Inc. In 1999,
I-Sector renewed its office lease for a five year period with monthly rental
payments of $38 plus certain operating expenses through December 1, 2004. The
lease was renewed February 1, 2002 for a five year period with monthly rental
payments of $37 plus certain operating expenses through January 31, 2007. Rental
expense under this agreement amounted to approximately $452, $446, and $446
during years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Additionally,
future minimum rentals on other operating leases amount to approximately $185 in
2004, $159 in 2005, $112 in 2006 and $3 in 2007. Amounts paid during the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, under such agreements totaled
approximately $197, $131 and $295, respectively.
401k plan -- I-Sector maintains a 401k savings plan wherein I-Sector
matches a portion of the employee contribution. In addition, I-Sector has a
discretionary matching fund based on the net profitability of I-Sector. All
full-time employees who have completed 90 days of service with I-Sector are
eligible to participate in the plan. Declaration of the discretionary portion of
the matching fund is the decision of the Board. I-Sector has made no additional
contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 or 2003.
Under the standard I-Sector matching program, I-Sector match was $32, $27, and
$31 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively.

In October 2000, I-Sector wholly owned subsidiary INX acquired certain
assets and liabilities of Internetwork Experts, Inc., a professional services
firm focused on the architecture, design, implementation and support of high-end
network infrastructure. The purchase price was $225 in cash and assumed
liabilities of $116. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the
assets and liabilities acquired based on fair values at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets
acquired was approximately $341, $200 of which has been allocated to a customer
list and service agreements. The remaining has been allocated to other
intangibles. INX was contingently liable for future payments to the former owner
based on the level of service revenue generated within a specified period of
time and within certain ranges for the customers included on the customer list.
That contingent liability was settled in 2001 for $50. The customer list and
other intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5
years.
On April 7, 2003, I-Sector subsidiary, INX, acquired certain assets and
liabilities of one of its competitors, Digital Precision, Inc. Digital.
Under the terms of the purchase, INX acquired fixed assets valued at $63,
inventory valued at $101 and intellectual property, customer lists, trademarks,
trade names and service marks, contract rights and other intangibles of Digital
valued at $376, as well as assumed certain operating leases of equipment and
office space with a net future obligation of $548. The office space in Dallas,
Texas was subleased with future rentals of $234. The intangibles are subject to
amortization and have a three year expected life. The purchase price was $540 in
cash and, contingent upon the retention of certain key employees, the obligation
to issue 1,800,000 shares of INX common stock in April 2004. If that contingency
is resolved in April 2004, I-Sector will recognize a minority interest related
to the issuance of INX common stock see Note 14. No goodwill was recognized
in the acquisition. The results of operations subsequent to April 7, 2003 are
included in I-Sector consolidated statement of operations.

14. SUBSIDIARY STOCK OPTION PLAN
Each of I-Sector three primary subsidiaries had an incentive stock option
plan in place, but all of the subsidiary plans except for INX were terminated in
December 2003. The INX plan has not been presented to the shareholders of
I-Sector for approval. INX has granted incentive awards under its incentive
plan, and such awards have been granted to certain employees and to management
of INX. Under INX plan such options vest typically ratably over three to five
years. In December 2003, the Company amended option agreements with INX two
most senior executives to convert to a fixed 5-year vesting schedule from one
that was determined based on the percentage of attainment of predefined
financial goals by INX. No stock-based compensation was recorded as the exercise
price equaled or exceeded management estimated fair value of the INX common
stock. Any unvested INX stock options may vest immediately upon the occurrence
of a liquidity event for that subsidiary. 5,435,000 of the options contain an
exercise restriction which only allows vested options to be exercised upon the
occurrence of a liquidity event or one month prior to the option expiration
date. The INX options expire ten years after the grant date if they are not
exercised. The INX stock option grants are subject to dilution when I-Sector
purchases additional shares of the subsidiary stock in order to keep the
subsidiary sufficiently capitalized. INX has 9,490,692 options granted and
outstanding, of which 3,777,666 are vested and 500,000 are exercisable at
December 31, 2003. The outstanding options have exercise prices ranging from
$001 to $025 per share with a weighted average of $017 per share. There are
no shares in INX plan available to be issued at December 31, 2003 and INX
plan has been amended, effective December 31, 2003 so that no further options
may be granted under the plan. The tables below reflect the ownership of INX at
December 31, 2003 and summarize the potential dilutive effect on I-Sector
ownership in INX if all options granted at December 31, 2003 were fully vested
and option grants were exercised, and include the effects of the issuance of
stock in 2004 relating to INX acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of
Digital Precision, Inc. The table does not assume any repurchase of shares with
proceeds from option exercises.                                  INX    PERCENT OF

1 Options granted and outstanding at December 31, 2003 include option grants
for 4,100,000 shares of INX granted to the two senior executives of INX and
vesting of these option grants was performance-based relating to the
percentage of predefined financial goals attained by INX while these two
senior executives remain employed. In December 2003, these option agreements
were amended to convert to a fixed 5-year vesting schedule.
2 Included in the option grants outstanding at December 31, 2003 are grants
for 1,881,692 shares granted to key employees related to the acquisition
Digital Precision, Inc. Grants for 500,000 of these shares vested April
2003. The balance of the grants for 1,381,692 shares, which were granted in
November 2003, vest over three years, starting in April 2004

3 During the year ended December 31, 2003, INX granted fully vested options to
purchase 1,200,000 shares of INX at an exercise price of $025 per share to
the CEO and Chairman of the Board of I-Sector Corporation. Such option grant
was voluntarily canceled by the CEO and Chairman of the Board of I-Sector
Corporation in February 2004 concurrent with the issuance of a warrant for
12 million Shares to I-Sector on similar terms. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, INX granted fully vested options to purchase 300,000
shares at an exercise price of $025 per share to the President and CEO of
INX. In addition, INX granted options vesting over three years to various
other employees during the year ended December 31, 2003.
4 The remainder of the shares included in INX option grants outstanding at
December 31, 2003 vest over either three or five years based upon continued
employment by INX of the individuals to whom such grants have been made. All
options granted by INX expire in ten years if unexercised.
5 In connection with the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of
Digital Precision, Inc. see Note 12, a portion of the consideration given
by INX was the contingent obligation to issue 1,800,000 shares of INX Common
Stock to Digital Precision, Inc. when and if three key employees complete
one year of employment with INX. If any of such key employees terminates
employment without cause before completion of one year of employment, the
number of shares of Common Stock to be issued to all of the former
stockholders of Digital Precision is decreased by scheduled and agreed upon
percentages.
