NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company, which operates in a single segment, home fragrance products,
designs, manufactures, and markets an extensive line of candles and home
fragrance products including scented candles, outdoor lighting products,
potpourri and environmental fragrance products and markets a broad range of
related candle accessories and decorative seasonal products.
A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of
the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blyth Industries,
Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies which
are not majority owned or controlled are reported using the equity method and
are recorded in other assets. Certain of the Company subsidiaries operate on a
52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in January. European
operations maintain a calendar year accounting period which is consolidated with
the Company fiscal period.
ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CREDIT CONCENTRATION
The Company credit sales are principally to department and gift stores, mass
merchandisers and distributors who purchase the Company products for resale.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
does not require collateral. The Company makes provisions for estimated credit
losses.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Company international subsidiaries use their local currency as their
functional currency. Therefore all balance sheet accounts of international
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end rate of exchange,
and statement of earnings items are translated at the weighted average exchange
rates for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are included in
Accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses on foreign currency
transactions, which are included in income, were not material.
INVESTMENTS
The Company makes investments from time to time in the ordinary course of its
business which may include selected assets and product lines, long term
investments and/or joint ventures that either complement or expand its existing
business.                    26           BLYTH INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations on certain committed capital expenditures,
Canadian intercompany payables and on certain intercompany loans. The Company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
With regard to commitments for machinery and equipment in foreign currencies,
upon payment of each commitment the underlying forward contract is closed and
the corresponding gain or loss is included in the measurement of the cost of the
acquired asset. With regard to forward exchange contracts used to hedge Canadian
intercompany payables, gain or loss on such hedges is recognized in earnings in
the period in which the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Gains or losses on
foreign currency forward contracts related to intercompany loans are recognized
currently through income and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in
the foreign currency cash flows which they are intended to hedge. If a hedging
instrument is sold or terminated prior to maturity, gains and losses are
deferred until the hedged item is settled. However, if the hedged item is no
longer likely to occur, the resultant gain or loss on the terminated hedge is
recognized into earnings.
For consolidated financial statement presentation, net cash flows from such
hedges are classified in the categories of the cash flow with the items being
hedged See further discussion in Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments include accounts receivable, accounts
payable, short-term and long-term debt. Management believes the carrying value
of these items approximates their estimated fair values.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the
first-in, first-out method. The elements of cost are material, labor and
overhead.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided principally by use
of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the
service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.
The principal estimated lives used in determining depreciation and amortization
are as follows                                
Buildings                             27 to 40 years
Leasehold improvements                       5 to 10 years
Machinery and equipment                      5 to 12 years
Office furniture, data processing equipment and software      3 to 7 years                    27           BLYTH INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EXCESS OF COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED
The excess of costs of the acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable
assets acquired less liabilities assumed is being amortized on a straight-line
basis ranging from 15-40 years. On an ongoing basis, management reviews the
valuation of the intangible assets to determine possible impairment by comparing
the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows of the related assets.

Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in equity during a period from
non-owner sources. The Company reports, by major components and as a single
total, the change in comprehensive income during the period as part of the

assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts.
REVENUE RECOGNITION

At January 31, 2000, the Company had two stock-based compensation plans, which
are described below.
In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has
elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation under the intrinsic
value based method of accounting described by Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under APB No. 25, generally, no cost is recorded for stock options issued to
employees unless the option price is below market at the time options are
granted. The following pro forma net earnings and net earnings per common
share are presented for informational purposes and have been computed using
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation as set forth
in SFAS No. 123 In thousands, except per share data     1998     1999     2000

Diluted                  110    149     189
-  The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant, using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively: expected
volatility was 425% for 1998 and 437% for 1999 and 433% for 2000; risk-free
interest rates at 569% to 699% for 1998, 427% to 567% for 1999 and 489% to
663% for 2000; expected life of 7 years for all years and no dividend payments.
The Company has adopted the Amended and Restated 1994 Employee Stock Option Plan
the Employee Option Plan, which provides for the grant to officers and
employees of both incentive stock options and stock options that are
non-qualified for Federal income tax purposes. The total number of shares of
common stock for which options may be granted pursuant to the Employee Option
Plan, subject to shareholder approval for 1,000,000 additional shares, is
2,880,000.
The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the Employee Option
Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock at
the time of grant, and the term of any option may not exceed 10 years. Options
generally become exercisable over a five-year period. With respect to any
employee who owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of the
outstanding capital stock of the Company, the exercise price of any incentive
stock option may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of such shares
at the time of grant, and the term of such option may not exceed five years.
The Company has also adopted the 1994 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors the Non-Employee Director Plan. A total of 120,000 shares of
common stock may be issued through the exercise of options granted pursuant to
the Non-Employee Director Plan. No option may be granted under the Non-Employee
Director Plan after May 18, 2004.                    34           BLYTH INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
