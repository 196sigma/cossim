INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Stockholders and Board of Directors
JLM Industries, Inc.
Tampa, Florida
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JLM Industries,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8. These consolidated financial
statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the consolidated
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of JLM Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of JLM Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The Company principal operating subsidiaries are JLM Marketing, Inc., JLM
Chemicals, Inc., JLM Terminals, Inc., JLM International, Inc., Olefins
Marketing, Inc., JLM Industries Europe B.V., JLM Chemicals Canada, Inc., JLM
Industries de Venezuela, C.A., Tolson Holland B.V., Tolson Transport B.V.,
Tolson Asia, Ltd. the Tolson Group, Inquinosa International S.A.
Inquinosa, and JLM South Africa. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Included in the 1999
consolidated financial statements is the 501% owned subsidiary, Inquinosa,
that the Company acquired in July 1998 see Note16. Included in the 1997
consolidated financial statements is the 55% owned subsidiary, JLM Industries
Europe B.V. In July 1997, the Company purchased the 45% minority interest in
JLM Industries Europe B.V.
CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS - Cash equivalents consist of highly
liquid investments with original maturities from purchase date of three months
or less.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The
costs of JLM Marketing, Inc. inventories are determined on the last-in,
first-out LIFO method. As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, JLM Marketing,
Inc. inventory was approximately 40% and 34%, respectively, of total
inventory. The costs of the Company remaining inventories are determined on
the first-in, first-out FIFO method. If LIFO inventories were valued at
current costs, operating income would have been approximately $570,000 1,585,000 and $0 lower than those reported for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The supplement of the replacement cost over
the value of inventories based upon the LIFO method was approximately $539,000
as of December 31, 1998 and 1999.
JLM enters into contracts whereby parties to the contracts agree to
exchange various quantities of inventory over a specified period of time. JLM
records these exchanges of inventory at the lower of cost or market. As of
December 31, 1998, JLM owed approximately $1,439,000 and as of December 31,
1999, JLM was owed approximately $718,000 under these contracts which are
included in inventory.  30
JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
In 1996, JLM entered into a fixed price financial hedging contract in
order to minimize its exposure in the three months ended March 31, 1997 to the
fluctuations in the price of propylene, one of the two key raw materials used
by JLM Chemicals, Inc. The purpose of the financial hedging contract was to
secure an acceptable purchase price for JLM propylene requirements in the
three months ended March 31, 1997. The contract was for 13 million pounds of
propylene at $1225 per pound. In accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 80, Accounting for Futures Contracts, gains and losses for such contracts
are recognized as an adjustment to cost of sales at the time the finished goods
are sold by JLM. During the three months ended March 31, 1997, JLM purchased
and sold substantially all of the 13 million pounds of propylene covered under
the hedging contract. As a result, JLM recognized a gain of approximately
$493,000, which reduced cost of sales for the period. JLM can be exposed to
losses in connection with such contracts, generally the amount by which the
fixed hedged price on the contract is above the market price for such chemicals
at the time of purchase. The Company did not enter into any material financial
hedging contracts in 1997, 1998, or 1999.
OTHER INVESTMENTS - Other investments include investments in partnerships
and the investment in Olefins Terminal Corporation OTC. JLM accounts for
certain of its investments in partnerships on the equity basis and,
accordingly, records its respective share of profits and losses that are
allocated in accordance with the partnership agreements. Except for OTC, JLM
has no obligation to make any contributions beyond its initial investment. See
further discussion of OTC in Note 5.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are
computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or
the estimated useful lives.
A summary of the lives used for computing depreciation is as follows   Buildings          15 and 315 years
Vehicles and airplane    2 to 10 years
Equipment          5 to 10 years
Furniture and fixtures    3 to 5 years
Leasehold improvements    Life of lease
OTHER ASSETS - As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, other assets consist
primarily of the cash surrender values of life insurance policies held on key
employees, license fees, certain development costs and advances on consulting
agreements, an option to purchase 85% of the outstanding common shares of a
melamine resin manufacturer, and prepayments for product testing see Note 12.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES - Goodwill and other intangibles resulting
From business acquisitions see Note 16, comprising cost in excess of net
assets of businesses acquired, customer lists, tax credit carry forwards,
employee contracts and distribution rights are being amortized over their
respective useful lives ranging from 3 to 40 years.
INCOME TAXES - JLM accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability
method as required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this
method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of
temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect of a tax rate
change on deferred taxes is recognized in operations in the period that the
change in the rate is enacted.  31

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Assets and
liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Results of operations are translated at weighted average rates for the year.
The effects of exchange rate changes in translating foreign financial
statements are presented as a separate component of stockholders' equity,
except for the Company Venezuelan subsidiary which operates in a
hyperinflationary economy for which the translation gains and losses are
included in net income currently.
Foreign Exchange Contracts - From time to time, JLM enters into foreign
exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign accounts payable and receivables.
Market value gains and losses are recognized and the resulting credit or debit
offsets foreign exchange gains and losses on these payables and receivables.
At December 31, 1998 and 1999, JLM had no open foreign exchange contracts.
Stock-Based Compensation - As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, JLM has elected to recognize stock-based compensation
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and to disclose in the consolidated financial statements the
effects of SFAS No. 123 as if its fair value recognition provisions were
adopted. See Note 19 for additional information on the Company stock-based
compensation.
Income Loss Per Share - Basic income loss per share is computed by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted income loss per share
reflects the potential dilutive effect of securities which can consist of
stock options and restricted stocks that could share in earnings of the
Company, unless the inclusion of these potential dilutive effects results in
antidilution.
Revenue Recognition - The Company recognizes revenue from product sales
upon shipment and passage of title. The Company estimates and records
provisions for quantity rebates and sales allowances, if necessary, in the
period the sale is reported.
Uses of Estimates - The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimated.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The estimated fair value of amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements have been determined by using
available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The
carrying value of all current assets and current liabilities approximate their
fair value because of their short-term nature. The fair value of long-term debt
approximates its carrying value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - The Company evaluates the recoverability
of the net carrying value of its property and equipment, goodwill and other
intangibles, and other long-lived assets by comparing the carrying values to
the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A deficiency in these cash flows
relative to the carrying amounts is an indication of the need for a write-down
due to impairment. The impairment write-down would be the difference between
the carrying amounts and the fair value of these assets. An impairment would
be recognized by a charge to operations.  32
JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Continued
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of
trade accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of entities
comprising the Company customer base and their dispersion across many
different geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers' financial condition and requires collateral, such as letters
of credit or business insurance, in certain circumstances.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In June 1997, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components
in a full set of general-purpose financial statements and is effective for all
companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 130
requires that all items that are required to be recognized under accounting
standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial
statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial
statements. SFAS No. 130 does not require a specific format for that financial
statement but requires that an enterprise display an amount representing total
comprehensive income for the period in that financial statement. SFAS No. 130
requires that an enterprise i classify items of other comprehensive income by
their nature and ii display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive
income separately from retained earnings and additional paid-in capital in the
equity section of a statement of financial position. The Company has adopted
SFAS No. 130 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of income
and comprehensive income.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Segment Data, which requires
companies to report selected segment information in their quarterly reports
issued to shareholders for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1997. It
also requires, among other items, entity-wide disclosure about the products and
services an entity provides, the material countries in which it holds assets
and reports revenues and its major customers. The Company adopted SFAS No. 131
in 1998 see Note 21. However, there were no changes required to be made to
prior year amounts.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which requires that gains or losses be
recognized in earnings for a fair value hedge in the period of change together
with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk
being hedged. SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, is effective for all fiscal
quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company has not
completed its evaluation of the impact of SFAS No. 133, if any, on the
financial statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain amounts in the 1997 consolidated financial
statements are reclassified to conform to the 1998 and 1999 presentation.  33

December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Future minimum capital lease
payments for each of the years 2000 through 2003 are approximately $106,000 49,000, $14,000, and $9,000, respectively.
4.   INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS
Investments in partnerships at December 31, 1998 and 1999, consist principally
of the following   PHENOL PLANT PARTNERSHIP - The Company holds a 2% interest in the Mt.
Vernon Phenol Plant Partnership via its wholly owned subsidiary JLM Ind,
Inc., an Indiana corporation. The plant converts cumene into phenol that is
marketed under contractual agreements to GE Plastics. JLM has a long-term
exclusive agreement through 2002, and thereafter, unless the agreement is
terminated upon prior notice, to purchase all acetone not used internally by GE
Plastics produced at the Mt. Vernon Phenol Plant. Based on its percentage
ownership, JLM accounts for this investment using the cost method. As of
December 31, 1998 and 1999, the amount of this investment was approximately
$496,000. During 1998 and 1999, JLM did not contribute to the partnership or
receive any distributions.
ASIAN PARTNERSHIP - In April 1997, JLM entered into an agreement to
purchase 25% of the common stock of S.K. Chemicals Asia Pte. Ltd. SK
Chemicals, an international petrochemical distributor, for $500,000 cash. In
addition, in April 1997, JLM entered into an agreement to purchase for $500,000
cash a 127% interest in S.K. Chemical Trading Pte. SK Trading. As of
December 31, 1998 and 1999, these investments of approximately $1,069,000 were
included in other investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
and are carried on the equity method.
REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIPS - The Company holds a 99% interest in Len-Kel
Realty Limited Partnership Len-Kel. During 1987 and 1988, Len-Kel acquired
28 units in a development project converting historical buildings into
residential use. The units are currently operated as rental property. JLM is a
limited partner in Len-Kel and cannot exert control over the partnership.
Accordingly, the investment is carried on the equity method. As of
December 31, 1997 and 1998, the amount of this investment was approximately
$996,000 and $948,000, respectively.  In 1999, the investment property was
sold for approximately $600,000. The sale of the property generated a loss of
approximately $336,000.  34
JLM INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED
4.   INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS - Continued
JLM holds other investments through limited partnerships. The amount of
these partnerships totaled approximately $744,000 and $450,000 at December 31,
1998 and 1999, respectively, and are carried on the cost method in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, JLM recorded
losses from partnership investments of approximately $48,000, $48,000, and $0,
respectively. As a limited partner, the Company has no obligation to make any
contributions beyond its initial investment.
During 1999, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Polyform USA
LLC, with the objective of acquiring an equity interest in a plastics
manufacturing facility in Greece. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the
Company loaned $30 million and has a secured interest in all of the machinery
and equipment at the Greece facility. Depending on the results of ongoing
negotiations, the Company may convert the loan to equity in the plant and may
contribute additional funds towards purchasing a majority equity position.
5.   OLEFINS TERMINAL CORPORATION
During 1991, JLM formed a 100% owned subsidiary, OTC, to design and
construct a polymer grade propylene export facility in Bayport, Texas. On
August 15, 1991, OTC issued stock and stock warrants to other investors
reducing the Company ownership to 49% 32% on a fully diluted basis.
Construction was completed in July 1992. The Company accounts for its
investment in OTC on the equity basis. During the years ended December 31,
1997, 1998 and 1999, losses from the investment in OTC of approximately
$830,000 and $0, and $0, respectively, were recorded. At December 31, 1998
and 1999, the Company investment in OTC was $0 due to the cumulative losses
incurred by OTC.
During 1996, JLM provided OTC with financial and management services for a
fee of 25% on certain sales, as defined. As part of the refinancing of OTC
long-term debt discussed below, JLM switched its management fee to a fixed rate
of approximately $16,000 per month. JLM recorded management fees of
approximately $134,000, $196,000 and $196,000 for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively, under this agreement.
On May 7, 1997, OTC refinanced its existing long-term debt and replaced it
with an unsecured term loan the Term Loan. The proceeds from the Term Loan
was, among other items, used to repay all of OTC existing long-term debt,
purchase all outstanding stock warrants and repay all outstanding management
fees to JLM. After the purchase of the stock warrants, OTC was 50% owned by
JLM. In conjunction with the refinancing, JLM terminaling contract was
canceled and a new, renewable, one-year terminaling arrangement, which became
effective January 1, 1997, was entered into by all parties. The new
terminaling contract, which has no minimum throughput requirements, requires
JLM to pay for throughput at $16 per metric ton during the one-year term and it
cancels the carryover rights from the old terminaling contract. Also in
conjunction with the refinancing, JLM non-current note receivable, including
accrued interest, was converted to an investment in OTC and JLM account
payable to OTC was forgiven and accounted for as a reduction in JLM
investment in OTC. The amount of the accounts payable to OTC which was
forgiven was approximately $2 million. In addition, JLM has pledged its
ownership interest in OTC to the other 50% owner as security for certain
contingent payment obligations required to be made equally by JLM and the other
50% owner of OTC, if OTC has inadequate operating funds.  35

for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. During
1997, the Company investment in OTC was reduced to zero due to the
recognition of the Company pro rata share of OTC operating losses. As the
Company has no current financial commitments to OTC, the Company will not
record additional losses on its investment until future operating income from
OTC surpasses the cumulative unrecorded operating losses or until any
contingent payment obligations, discussed above, are required. As of December
31, 1999, the Company had cumulative unrecorded operating losses from OTC of
approximately $3,209,000.

The loans payable are collateralized by most of JLM inventory and
accounts receivable. As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, JLM had a total of
approximately $125,000,000 of credit facilities available with various
financial institutions of which approximately $95,116,000 and $56,866,000,
respectively, was unused. Additionally, as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, JLM
had guaranteed vendor letters of credit of approximately $12,836,000 and
$22,638,000, respectively.
In November 1999, the Company completed the restructuring of its unsecured
$30 million line of credit replacing it with a $345 million line of credit
the LOC. Under the terms of the restructuring, $145 million is a five
year secured term loan which will expire on November 1, 2004 and the remaining
$200 million will be used to fund working capital needs with terms that will
expire on November 1, 2001.
During 1998, the Company negotiated additional lines of credit with two
new financial institutions that are renewable each year in the amount of $520
million. These lines of credit are to be used primarily for the Company
international subsidiaries. The lines of credit are unused and are secured by
accounts receivable and inventory.
JLM loans payable contain certain financial covenants which must be met
with respect to, among other things, minimum consolidated net income levels,
minimum current ratio and debt service. JLM was not in compliance with certain
of such financial covenants as of December 31, 1999 related to quarterly income
levels. With respect to such noncompliance, the Company received a waiver from
the respective financial institutions. Certain provisions of the loans payable
to which JLM is subject restricts JLM ability to pay dividends.

9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In 1997, the Company entered into an agreement for sale and purchase of
common stock held by the majority stockholder of JLM and an unrelated third
party to purchase for a total purchase price of approximately $125 million all
of the issued and outstanding shares of Aurora. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company purchased from the majority owner of JLM his 80%
ownership interest in Aurora for a $10 million promissory note that matures on
June 1, 2002 and bears interest at a rate of 100% per annum. The other
shareholder of Aurora received consideration of $250,000 for the purchase of
his ownership interest. Of such amount, $150,000 was paid at closing in cash
and $100,000 was paid by a three year promissory note which bears interest at
the prime rate and is payable in three equal annual installments. During 1998,
the Company repaid the entire outstanding balance due to the unrelated third
party.  The transaction described above has been accounted for as a
combination of entities under common control using historical amounts. 38

In 1997, the Company leased chemical tank railcars from Phoenix, a
Connecticut corporation of which the sole owner is the majority stockholder of
JLM. The Company made payments in 1997 to Phoenix in respect of such leases of
approximately $203,000 and $6,000, respectively. In 1997, the Company entered
into an agreement for sale and purchase of common stock with JLM majority
stockholder to purchase for a total purchase price of $500,000 all of the
issued and outstanding shares of Phoenix. Under the terms of the agreement,
the Company purchased the majority stockholder of JLM ownership interest in
Phoenix for $500,000, of which $250,000 was offset against advances owed to the
Company by the majority stockholder of JLM and $250,000 paid by means of a
promissory note that matures on June 1, 2002 and bears interest at a rate of
100% per annum. The transaction described above has been accounted for as a
combination of entities under common control using historical amounts.
JLM has loans payable to its majority stockholder of $905,148 at December
31, 1998 and 1999. The loan payable bears interest at the prime rate, which
was 775% and 825% at December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively, and matures on
June 1, 2002. Additionally, the Company has approximately $1,700,000 of
miscellaneous receivables owed by the majority stockholder. These items are
netted together and included as part of other accounts receivable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

11.   TREASURY STOCK AND STOCK SPLIT
Chemical Trading, S.L. Trading, JLM Spanish distributor, is indebted
to JLM pursuant to an arrangement in which JLM pays the distributor operating
expenses. JLM treats the difference between such payments made by JLM and the
amount of commissions and other amounts due to the distributor in respect of
his activities on behalf of JLM as a loan by JLM to the distributor. Such
indebtedness was carried on an open account basis and in July 1996, $522,200
was repaid without interest through the sale to JLM at fair market value of 48
shares 267,264 shares after giving effect to the stock split in July 1997 of
common stock owned by Trading owner. On July 3, 1997, JLM approved the
retirement of the shares of the Company common stock held in treasury by the
Company and a stock split resulting in an exchange of 1 share for 5,568 shares
of common stock issued and outstanding. All share and per share amounts have
been retroactively adjusted for this split. Effective October 1, 1998 500,000 owed by Trading was repaid without interest through the sale to JLM at
fair market value of 90,909 shares of the Company common stock owned by
Trading owner.
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company purchased 3,290 shares of common
stock from certain officers of the Company valued at $72,000.  The Company
entered into the transaction in order to assume certain tax liabilities related
to the vested portion of the restricted stock received by the officers.
On October 16, 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a Stock
Repurchase Program the Program whereby the Company can purchase up to
500,000 shares of its common stock. During 1998 and 1999, the Company
purchased approximately 330,000 and 149,000 shares of its common stock for
approximately $1,818,000 and $713,000, respectively, under the Program.
12.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

JLM is subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws,
rules, regulations and ordinances concerning emissions to the air, discharges
to surface and subsurface waters, and the generation, handling, storage,
transportation, treatment, disposal and import and export of hazardous
materials. JLM has engaged environmental counsel for four of their facilities:
the JLM Chemicals, Inc., Blue Island, Illinois facility, the JLM Terminals,
Inc. facility, JLM Real Estate, Inc. property and the Polychem facility.
Regarding the JLM Chemicals facility, JLM believes that the low levels of
various organic compounds detected in the soil and groundwater at the facility
are the result of historical use of the facility prior to the acquisition by
JLM and/or migration from neighboring facilities. JLM also believes that the
likelihood of either state or federal environmental regulatory agencies seeking
remediation in the near term is low, based on the location of the facility, the
character of the area each of which are factors in assessing risk and the
fact that the site is pending removal from the federal list of contaminated
sites. Regarding the JLM Terminals, Inc. facility and the JLM Realty property,
JLM believes that ultimate liability for remediation of soil and groundwater
contamination rests with the previous owner of the facility and/or a
neighboring facility.
In 1998, the Company assumed from the previous owner of both the JLM
Terminal, Inc. and JLM Realty, Inc. the implementation of state approved
Remedial Action Plans RAPs to address onsite petroleum contamination at the
sites.  Compliance with the RAPs does not foreseeably require any capital
expenditures and the Company believes that the owners of the neighboring
properties may bear a significant portion of the responsibility or any
additional remediation. Regarding the Polychem facility, levels of organic
compounds slightly in excess of regulatory thresholds were detected in the
ground water. JLM addressed the problem and recent analytical results show the
levels of contamination have decreased to acceptable levels. Accordingly, JLM
has requested that state authorities permit closure of the remediation of the
Polychem facility. JLM does not believe that a material amount of funds will
be required to complete remediation at any of the sites. Accordingly, the
Company has not accrued any amounts related to the remediation of any of the
sites.
During 1997, the Internal Revenue Service IRS concluded its federal
income tax examination of JLM 1988 through 1990 and 1992 through 1994 tax
years. JLM subsequently made payments to the IRS as a result of these
examinations. The settlement of these IRS examinations did not materially
affect the Company financial condition or results of operations in 1997 or
1998.
On March 10, 1998, the Company executed a long-term purchase agreement
with Solutia, Inc. Solutia to purchase, on a take-or-pay basis, phenol to
be produced at a phenol plant to be built on the Gulf Coast of the United
States. Under terms of the agreement, the Company was required to advance over
three years $35 million to Solutia as a partial prepayment for future inventory
purchases. The prepayment was scheduled to be paid as follows: $5 million on
or about December 31, 1998, $65 million in equal quarterly payments in 1999,
and the remaining balance in equal quarterly payments in 2000. Under the
contract, Solutia is required to sell 125 million pounds of phenol per year to
JLM for 15 years at a specified price outlined in the agreement with a credit
on a per pound basis for the advancement mentioned above. Construction of the
plant was anticipated to commence in the beginning of 1999 and phenol
production was anticipated to begin at the plant in the fourth quarter of 2000.
The agreement also provides that if the Company available borrowing capacity
under its aggregate credit facilities is less than the total amount of the
advance payments owed to Solutia, Solutia may require the Company to deliver to
Solutia an executed, irrevocable bank guaranty equal to the total amount of the
advance payments owed to Solutia. Due to market conditions, the project and
any required payments were suspended prior to December 31, 1998 through the
mutual consent of both Solutia and the Company.  42

On May 26, 1999, the Company entered into an Option Agreement the
Option, for $11 million, to acquire 85% of the outstanding common shares of
GZ Holdings Inc. at a purchase price of $150 million. The Option expires
March 31, 2001. The Company did not exercise its option as of December 31,
1999. In March 2000, the parties extended the option expiration date to March
31, 2002 and amended the purchase price to $200 million. If the option is
exercised prior to March 31, 2001, the $11 million option price shall be
applied against the purchase price.
During 1999, the Company entered into a sales contract with a third party
to sell phenol on a formula based price. Upon entering the contract, the
Company received $416 million as a prepayment towards future purchases by the
third party. Volume commitments by the third party were 18 million pounds in
1999, 30 million pounds annually for each of the years 2000 through 2008. The
prepayment was recorded as deferred revenue and will be applied against future
purchases. Sales exceeding the yearly volume under the contract will be sold
at market price. Additionally, the third party has an option to increase the
volume up to 45 million pounds in 2002 for an additional prepayment of $17
million by December 31, 2001.
13.   EARNINGS PER SHARE
As described in Note 17, the Company Board of Directors adopted formal
plans to discontinue certain segments of its business. Additionally during
1997, the Company repaid certain debt from proceeds received from the initial
public offering of its Common Stock in July 1997. As part of the repayment of
the debt, the Company incurred $386,000 of extraordinary loss see Note 18.
Accordingly, the following table illustrates the impact of such items on income
per share for the year ended December 31, 1997                      1997
Basic earnings per share:
Discontinued operations        $ 003
Extraordinary item            007
Diluted earnings per share:
Discontinued operations        $ 003
Extraordinary item            007
The basic earnings per share calculation is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding adjusted for actual shares issued or
reacquired during the period. In conjunction with the initial public offering,
the Company issued 411,500 options to employees of the Company at an exercise
price of $10 per share of which 366,033 shares, reduced by employee turnover,
were still outstanding at December 31, 1999. The average market price of the
Company common stock was less than the exercise price of the options
throughout 1999.  43

14.   PROFIT-SHARING PLAN
The Company has a defined contribution profit-sharing plan covering
substantially all of its employees. The Company contributes 100% of the
contribution of eligible employees, up to a maximum amount of 6% of the
employees' compensation. The Company contribution rate is determined
annually at the beginning of each plan year. The costs for this plan were
approximately $348,000, $395,000 and $376,000 in 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively.
Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are profit-
sharing bonuses paid to employees based on performance or formulas. The bonuses
of the Company for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, were
approximately $529,000, $656,000 and $84,000, respectively.
15.   POLYCHEM LTD., INC.
During 1994, the Company formed and held a 95% ownership of a new
subsidiary, JLM Acquisition, Inc. On August 8, 1994, JLM Acquisition, Inc.
purchased substantially all the business assets of Polychem, a chemical dyes
distributor in Dalton, Georgia, for $900,000 in cash and a promissory note for
$1,240,000 payable in semi-annual installments over five years.
On October 26, 1995, JLM completed the sale of substantially all the
operating assets of Polychem for cash of $882,000 and the assumption of related
liabilities. The purchaser had an irrevocable option for a period of three
years to buy the Polychem real property for $1; however, such option was not
exercised by the purchaser. Therefore, the Company retained title to this real
property. In 1999, the property was sold for approximately $600,000. The sale
of the property generated a loss of approximately $336,000.  44

valuation date of March 31, 1998, less excluded receivables as defined in the
Share Purchase Agreement and the execution of a $29 million promissory note
that accrues interest at the LIBOR rate plus 1%. The promissory note is
payable in five semi-annual installments of $350,000 with a lump-sum payment of
$11 million due in May 2001 see Note 8. Based on the combined negative
shareholders' equity of the Tolson Group as of March 31, 1998, Tolson Holding.
B.V. contributed approximately $74 million to bring the combined negative
equity of the Tolson Group to zero.
The purchase of the Tolson Group excluded certain receivables, as defined
in the Share Purchase Agreement. For such excluded receivables, JLM will
collect such receivables on a best efforts basis and JLM will receive a
commission, as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement, for actual collections
made.  In 1999, goodwill was reduced by approximately $341,000 to reflect the
reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset which was realized in
1999.
On July 3, 1998, the Company acquired 501%, of the outstanding common
stock of Inquinosa, a Spanish company. The purchase price for Inquinosa was
$450,000 plus an estimated $135 million to be funded through a three-year
earn-out period based on a formula as defined in the agreement. The 1999
payment was approximately $689,000. The effective date of the acquisition was
July 1, 1998. Inquinosa is a worldwide marketer of the pesticide lindane.
Lindane is a preferred seed-treating pesticide that prevents insect damage
during the critical pre-germination stage for wheat, other grains and canola.
All of the above acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting.

22.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company has made the decision to discontinue it operations conducted
through its subsidiary, JLM Industries de Venezuela, C.A. The Company is
targeting an April 2000 shutdown. At this point, management does not believe
there will be any material costs related to closing the existing operations.
In order to maintain a presence in Venezuela, the Company will take a minority
equity interest in an old line distribution business which was a direct
competitor of JLM in the local markets.  Management believes joining forces
will not only reduce competition, but will also allow the new entity to take
advantage of cost synergies which under normal circumstances would not be
available. As a result, management believes that the new structure should
generate positive results for both partners. The agreement calls for both
partners to transfer selective assets into the venture receivables, inventory,
payables. Each partner will guarantee the solvency of the respective debtors
transferred as part of the joint venture agreement.  50
