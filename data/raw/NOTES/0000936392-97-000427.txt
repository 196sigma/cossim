REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Sequana Therapeutics, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sequana
Therapeutics, Inc. as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Sequana
Therapeutics, Inc. as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                           ERNST & YOUNG LLP San Diego, California

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996
1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Business Activity
Sequana Therapeutics, Inc. Sequana or the Company is a
genomics company that uses industrial-scale gene discovery technology and
functional genomics to discover and characterize genes that cause certain common
diseases. The Company proprietary gene discovery technology is based on
positional cloning, a method that uses statistical analysis of disease
inheritance patterns to isolate disease genes. The Company has ongoing discovery
programs in asthma, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, schizophrenia, manic
depression and other disease areas. The Company believes that identification of
disease genes and determination of their biological function will provide
insights into the causes of common diseases and may facilitate the development
of novel prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic products.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, NemaPharm, Inc. NemaPharm since the
date of acquisition see Note 2. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly-liquid investments with maturities
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company generally invests its excess cash in U.S. government
securities, high credit quality commercial paper, certificates of deposit and
money market accounts. Such investments are made in accordance with the
Company investment policy which establishes guidelines relative to
diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity. These
guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in
yields and interest rates.
Investment Securities
The Company classifies its investment securities as
available-for-sale. Such securities are carried at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses, if any, reported as a separate component of shareholders'
equity. The cost of investment securities classified as available-for-sale is
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity.
Such amortization and accretion is included in interest income. Realized gains
and losses are also included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method.                                        33

Furniture and Equipment
Furniture and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the
estimated useful lives of the assets generally four to seven years on a
straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of
the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets. Amortization of
equipment under capital leases is reported with depreciation of furniture and
equipment.
Research and Development Revenue and Expenses
Revenue under strategic alliances is recognized as research
activities are performed over the term of the agreements and upon the
achievement of certain milestones. Revenues for cost reimbursement are
recognized as the related costs are incurred. Advance payments received in
excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue. Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred.
Net Loss Per Share
Net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding during the periods, as adjusted for the effects of certain
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission for the periods prior to the
Company initial public offering IPO in July 1995. Shares issuable upon the
exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants are not reflected for the
periods subsequent to the Company IPO as their effect is anti-dilutive.
Stock Options
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted FASB Statement No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123. FAS 123 allows
companies to either account for stock-based compensation under the new
provisions of FAS 123 or under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, but
requires pro forma disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements as if
the measurement provisions of FAS 123 had been adopted. The Company elected to
continue to account for its stock-based compensation in accordance with
provisions of APB 25.
Asset Impairment
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of FAS 121. FAS
121 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the estimated
undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the
assets' carrying amount. The adoption of the new standard had no effect on the
Company financial position or results of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year classifications.                                        34
35
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
disclosures made in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
2. ACQUISITION
On October 15, 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of NemaPharm, a drug discovery company, through the issuance of
approximately 158,000 shares of the Company common stock and options to
acquire 38,000 shares of the Company common stock. The acquisition was
accounted for under the purchase method and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements include the operations of NemaPharm from the date of its
acquisition. The aggregate cost of NemaPharm of approximately $34 million was
charged to acquired in-process research and development during 1996. The
operations of NemaPharm had no material effect on the pro forma combined results
of operations of the Company and NemaPharm for the periods preceding the
Company acquisition.
3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES

million, respectively, all of which is pledged as security pursuant to the
Company equipment financing agreements. Accumulated amortization with respect
to such equipment totaled $37 million and $16 million at December 31, 1996 and
1995, respectively.
5. NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES
Notes receivable consist primarily of loans made to certain officers
and employees to facilitate their relocation. Such notes accrue interest at the
applicable federal rate, as adjusted yearly, and are due upon demand. The notes
are secured by approximately 88,000 shares of common stock and options to
purchase 219,000 shares of common stock at December 31, 1996.
6. LOAN AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The Company leases its facilities under operating leases that
generally provide for annual cost-of-living related increases. Certain equipment
is leased under operating and capital leases. Total rent expense under operating
leases was $21 million, $860,000 and $747,000, for the years ended December 31,
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
In October 1996, the Company entered into a credit agreement with a
bank which, subject to compliance with certain financial covenants and
conditions, may be used by the Company to finance up to $7 million of capital
expenditures or other working capital requirements through September 1997.
Included in loans and capital lease obligations at December 31, 1996 was $1
million of loans obtained pursuant to this agreement. The agreement provides for
equal principal installments over a four-year period commencing in September
1997, along with interest based on Eurodollar rates 719% at December 31,

7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Common Stock
In March 1996, the Company raised net proceeds of $30 million
through a follow-on public offering of its common stock.
In August 1995, the Company completed its IPO of common stock
providing net proceeds of $186 million. Upon the closing of the Company IPO,
all previously outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into common
stock. The holders of the common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred
stock remain entitled to certain registration rights with respect to such
shares.
Deferred Compensation
The Company has recorded deferred compensation for the difference
between the price per share of certain stock sold and stock options granted and
the deemed fair value of such shares for accounting purposes. Deferred
compensation is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the related
stock and options. The Company recorded deferred compensation of approximately
$13 million in connection with the issuance of 208,333 shares of common stock
to the Company President and Chief Executive Officer in exchange for a
$187,500 promissory note and the sale of 86,805 shares of common stock to two
affiliated shareholders for $78,125 in March 1995. The promissory note bears
interest at 72%, is secured by the 208,333 shares of common stock and becomes
due and payable upon the occurrence of certain events. Such shares vest over a
four year period, with the unvested shares subject to repurchase by the Company
at the original issue price in the event of this employee termination.
Stock Warrants
At December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding warrants to
purchase an aggregate of 111,471 shares of the Company common stock. The
warrants are exercisable at prices ranging from $3 to $24 per share and expire
at various dates through 2005.
Stock Option Plans
In April 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Incentive Stock Plan
the Plan, under which, as amended, 1,063,125 shares of the Company common
stock were reserved for issuance. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to employees and
consultants. Options under the Plan have a ten-year term and generally vest over
four years. The exercise price of incentive stock options must equal at least
the fair market value on the date of grant, and the exercise price of
nonstatutory stock options is as determined by the Board of Directors.
During 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Director Option Plan the
Director Plan, under which, as amended, 225,000 shares of the Company
common stock were reserved for issuance to all non-employee members of the Board
of Directors. The Director Plan provides for the automatic grant of an option to
purchase shares of the Company common stock at the time the non-employee joins
the Board of Directors. The options have a ten-year term, an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, and
vest over four years.                                        37
38
At December 31, 1996, options to purchase 75,000 shares of the Company common
stock were granted and outstanding under the Director Plan with a
weighted-average exercise price of $1090 per share.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share is
required by FAS 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock options under the alternative fair value method provided for
in FAS 123. The fair value for these options was estimated as of the date of
grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 1996 and 1995, respectively: risk-free interest
rates of 639% and 638% volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company common stock of 61%, and 33%; and a weighted-average expected life of
the option of 5 years. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during
the year ended December 31, 1996 was $1006.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. Because the Company stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in highly subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of
the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The
Company pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share totaled
approximately $234 million and $243 per share, respectively, for the year
ended December 31, 1996. The pro forma results for 1995 were not materially
different than the reported results for the period. The pro forma results are
not likely to be representative of the effects of applying FAS 123 on the
reported net income or loss for future years as these amounts reflect the
expense associated with only one or two years of vesting.

Plan the Purchase Plan, under which 200,000 shares of the Company common
stock were reserved for issuance. The Purchase Plan provides for all eligible
employees to purchase the Company common stock through payroll deductions at a
price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value per share on the start
date of each overlapping two year offering period or on the date on which each
semi-annual purchase period ends. The Purchase Plan will terminate in May 2005.

41
Genentech
In October 1994, Genentech, Inc. made a $2 million equity investment
in the Company and was granted first negotiation rights with respect to the
development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic or prophylactic
proteins. The Company retains the ability to license rights to develop
therapeutic or prophylactic proteins as part of any such strategic alliances.
Collaborative Agreements
In April 1996, the Company entered into a collaborative agreement
with Aurora Biosciences Corporation Aurora. Under the agreement, the Company
gained access to certain technologies and rights to contract with Aurora for the

9. INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 1996, the Company had federal and California income
tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $32,122,000 and
$1,191,000, respectively. The difference between the federal and California tax
loss carryforwards is primarily attributable to the capitalization of research
and development expenses for California income tax purposes and the fifty
percent limitation on California loss carryforwards.
The federal and California tax loss carryforwards will begin to
expire in 2008 and 1998, respectively, unless previously utilized. The Company
also has federal and California research tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $972,000 and $349,000, respectively, which will begin to expire in
2008 unless previously utilized.
Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code,
annual use of the Company net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be
limited because of cumulative changes in ownership of more than 50% which have
occurred. However, the Company does not believe such limitation will have a
material impact upon the utilization of these carryforwards.                                        41

Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets and
liabilities are shown below. A valuation allowance of $14,233,000 has been
recognized to offset the deferred tax assets, as realization of such assets is
uncertain.                                  DECEMBER 31,

The Company maintains a 401k profit sharing plan which allows
substantially all employees to contribute up to 15% of their salary, subject to
annual limitations. The Board of Directors may, at its sole discretion, approve
Company contributions. To date, there have been no Company contributions under
the plan.
11. JOINT VENTURE
In January 1997, the Company and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center MSK formed Genos Biosciences, Inc. Genos, a new company focused
on the research and identification of genes and related genetic information of
value in the prognosis, diagnosis and possible treatment of certain common
cancers. The Company and MSK each own 50% of Genos and have committed to
contribute approximately $5 million each to fund its initial operations. The
Company invested $12 million in Genos in connection with its formation and
anticipates that Sequana remaining commitment will be funded during 1997 and
early 1998. In connection with the formation of Genos, the Company sold a
warrant to MSK to purchase 350,000 shares of the Company common stock
exercisable at a price of $1738 per share. The Company Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer are members of the Board of Directors of
Genos.                                        42
