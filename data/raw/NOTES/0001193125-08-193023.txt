is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LeCroy Corporation and subsidiaries as of June28, 2008 and
June30, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended June28, 2008,June30, 2007, and July1, 2006, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No109, effective July1, 2007. We also have

LeCROY CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and
per share amounts 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization LeCroy Corporation the Company or LeCroy, was founded
and incorporated in the State of New York in 1964 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1995. The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses high-performance oscilloscopes and global communications protocol analyzers. Oscilloscopes
are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high-performance systems, to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market. Protocol analyzers are tools used by designers
and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high speed serial data interfaces, including USB20, Bluetooth, PCI Express, Serial ATA, Serial Attached SCSI SAS, Wireless USB, and others. The Companys products are sold worldwide into a
broad range of end markets, including  electronics, data storage, automotive/industrial, and military/aerospace. Revenues are also generated from the sale of probes, accessories, and applications solutions, and to a
lesser extent, extended warranty and maintenance contracts, repairs and calibrations performed on instruments after the expiration of their warranties. Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of LeCroy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-years amounts to conform to the current year
presentation. The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles US GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition, reserves for accounts receivable, allowance for excess and
obsolete inventory, valuation of long-lived and intangible assets, goodwill, income taxes, share-based compensation expense and estimation of warranty liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements judgment and available
information and, consequently, actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue LeCroy recognizes product and service revenue, net of allowances for anticipated returns, provided that 1persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, 2delivery has occurred, 3the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer, or when
services have been provided. The price is considered fixed or determinable when it is not subject to refund or adjustments. The Company
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivable estimated to be non-collectible. The Company analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in
customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company maintains an allowance for anticipated sales returns. The Company analyzes historical return trends as well as in-transit product
returns to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for anticipated returns. Test and measurement products revenue. The Company
generates Test and measurement product revenue from the sales of oscilloscopes and application solutions, protocol analyzers, probes and accessories. Provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped. 
61 Table of Contents
Application solutions, which provide oscilloscopes with additional analysis capabilities, are either
delivered via compact disc or are already loaded in the oscilloscopes and activated via a key code after the sale is made to the customer. No post-contract support is provided on the oscilloscope application solutions. All sales of test and
measurement products are based upon separately established prices for the items and are recorded as revenue according to the above revenue recognition criteria. Revenues from oscilloscope products are included in revenues from Test and measurement
products in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain software is embedded in the Companys oscilloscopes, but the embedded software component is considered incidental. Due to the significant software content of its protocol analyzer products, the Company recognizes revenue on the sale of these products, in accordance
with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by Statement of Position98-9, Modifications of SOP97-2 with
Respect to Certain Transactions SOP98-9, upon shipment, provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable. Software
maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods. In limited circumstances where VSOE does not exist for software
maintenance support, the Company recognizes revenue and accrues costs, if applicable, under the appropriate provisions of SOP 97-2 determined by the facts and circumstances of each transaction. Provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time
products are recognized as revenue. Revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in Test and measurement products in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal 2006, in an effort to provide end-user customers an alternative to purchasing the Companys higher end products under its standard terms and conditions, the Company began offering customers an
opportunity to enter into sales-type or direct financing leases for these products. The Company is accounting for these leases in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No13, Accounting for
Leases. Lease and rental revenues are reported within Test and measurement product revenue and were $07 million, $18 million and $07 million for the years ended June28, 2008,June30, 2007 and July1, 2006,
respectively. Service and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes extended warranty contracts, software maintenance
agreements, repairs and calibrations performed on instruments after the expiration of their normal warranty period and direct service accessories and packages. The Company records deferred revenue for extended warranty contracts, software
maintenance agreements and calibrations services and then recognizes such revenue on a straight-line basis over the related service period. When arrangements include multiple elements, the Company uses relative fair values in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, to allocate revenue to the elements and recognizes revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each
element. Deferred license revenue. Revenue from license fees under agreements that have exclusivity clauses and, from the
licensees perspective, have ongoing requirements or expectations that are more than perfunctory, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements. An ongoing requirement or expectation would be considered more
than perfunctory if any party to the contract considers it to be essential to the functionality of the delivered product or service or failure to complete the activities would result in the customer receiving a full or partial refund or
rejecting the products delivered or services performed to date. Beginning in fiscal 2001 with the adoption of the SECs Staff
Accounting Bulletin, SAB No101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, superseded by SAB 104, certain previously recognized license fee revenue was deferred and recognized in future
periods over the terms of the agreements. The adoption of SAB 101 was recorded as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 and resulted in a non-cash charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change of $44 million, net of a tax benefit of $27
million. The deferred revenue was being amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over 55 years, the remaining terms of the license agreements. The Company recognized pretax license fee revenue of $07 million during fiscal year 2006, which
is included in Service and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of July1, 2006, there was no remaining deferred license revenue from the adoption of SAB 101. 
62 Table of Contents
Share -Based Compensation In the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R which requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method under which
the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date. The fair value of the compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered that were outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining service
period after the adoption date based on the awards original estimate of fair value. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights. The fair value of stock options is
estimated on the date of grant, while the fair value for stock appreciation rights is estimated on the date of grant and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period, since it is liability-classified. Determining the fair value of options and
stock appreciation rights requires certain estimates by management including the expected volatility and expected term of the option. Management also makes decisions regarding the risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates
regarding forfeiture rates. Fluctuations in the market or other factors that affect these estimates could have a material impact on the resulting compensation cost. The fair value of restricted stock grants referred to as non-vested stock is
determined based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Related compensation expense is recognized ratably over the associated requisite service period, giving effect to estimated forfeitures. On November10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position 123R-3 FSP 123R-3,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-based Payment Awards, that provided an elective alternative transition method of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies
recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R the APIC Pool to the method otherwise required by paragraph 81 of SFAS 123R. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company made the election to use the alternative method;
however, the alternative method does not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or financial condition due to the Companys net operating loss position for tax purposes See Note 13 Share-based Compensation for
additional information. Warranty The Company provides a warranty on its products, generally extending between one and three years after delivery, and accounted for in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies
SFAS 5. Estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to Cost of revenues in the period that the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability
and, for certain new products, published by a third party expected failure rates. The expected failure rate is arrived at in terms of units, which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to
derive the amount of accrued warranty required. On a quarterly basis, the Company studies trends of warranty claims and performance of specific products and adjusts its warranty obligation through charges or credits to Cost of revenues See Note 10
Warranties and Guarantees for additional information. Business Realignment and Related Asset Impairment Costs
The Company records realignment charges related to workforce reductions in accordance with SFAS No112,
Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits SFAS 112, and SFAS No88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits
SFAS 88. Pursuant to SFAS 112, costs related to employee severance are recorded when probable and estimable in accordance with our ongoing severance policy. SFAS 88, paragraph 15, provides that contractual termination benefits are
recorded when it is probable and estimable. Charges for the impairment of long-lived assets are recognized in accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which establishes a single accounting
model for the impairment of long-lived assets, as described below in the policy titled, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets. 
63 Table of Contents
Restructuring Charges The Company records restructuring costs in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS 146, which requires that a liability for charges associated with an exit or disposal activity be measured and recognized initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. Related to restructuring exit activities, the
Company may also have involuntary terminations that are accounted for under SFAS 112 or SFAS 88 as applicable, or under SFAS 146 if the severance and related costs are considered to be a one-time benefit arrangement outside of the Companys
ongoing severance policy. Shipping and handling costs The Company records the costs and fees associated with transporting its products to customers as a component of Selling, general and administrative
expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs totaled approximately $31 million, $42 million and $35 million for the fiscal years ended June28, 2008,June30, 2007 and July1, 2006, respectively.
Advertising Costs The costs of general advertising, promotion and marketing programs are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the fiscal year incurred. The costs of advertising related to new
product introductions are deferred until such advertising first takes place, which generally coincides with product introduction. Advertising expense for the fiscal years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007 and July1, 2006 was
approximately $28 million, $30 million and $26 million, respectively. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company evaluates the requirement to capitalize certain software development costs for
protocol analyzers in accordance with SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86. Under SFAS 86, costs incurred to develop or significantly enhance
computer software products are charged to research and development expense as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. The nature of the Companys development for protocol analyzers is generally such that the Company can
measure technological feasibility most effectively using the working model method where the time between establishment of a working model and general availability is of short duration which results in very little or no costs that qualify for
capitalization. As such, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs for the years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007 and July1, 2006. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash in excess of current operating requirements are invested in
cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid interest bearing investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred and major betterments are
capitalized. Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life or related lease term, if shorter, as follows:  Building and improvements
10-32years
Furniture, machinery and equipment
2-10years
Computer software and hardware
2-7 years

Inventories Inventories, with the exception of demonstration units in finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. Costs include material, labor and overhead charges. Demonstration units
are accounted for as inventory since they are sold in the normal course of business and are stated at lower of cost specific identification method or market. The Company reviews the valuation of inventory on a quarterly basis and provides an allowance for the value of estimated excess and obsolete raw materials and work in process inventory. The Companys marketing
department plays a key role in the inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with the manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory. Based upon managements
forecast, inventory items no longer expected to be used in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventorys quantity and its forecasted usage are classified as excess. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required. Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets The Company monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate
carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair
value. During fiscal 2006, there were no impairment indicators. During fiscal 2007, an intangible asset failed the impairment test due to a change in the Companys product strategy and, accordingly, a $03 million pre-tax loss was recognized in
Cost of revenues in the fiscal 2007 Consolidated Statement of Operations. During fiscal 2008, an indefinite-lived intangible asset failed the impairment test due to a change in the Companys product strategy and, accordingly, a $07 million
pre-tax loss was recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fiscal 2008 Consolidated Statement of Operations See Note 8 Goodwill and Other Non-Current Assets for additional information. Goodwill Under SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might be
impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires the Company to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value. Testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely
than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Such an event may occur if, for an extended period of time, the market value of the Companys common stock plus a control premium were less than the carrying value
of the Company. The Company obtains information on sales of similar sized companies in the technology industry to estimate a control premium. Management also reviews the Companys financial position quarterly for other triggering events as described in SFAS No142. Should actual results not meet expectations or assumptions change in future years, the impairment
assessment could result in a lower fair value estimate which could result in an impairment charge that may materially affect the carrying value of the Companys assets and results from operations. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value-based test. A reporting unit is defined as the same as or one
level below the operating segment level as described in SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Company has one reporting unit, in the test and measurement business, because none of the
components of the Company constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and for which Company management regularly reviews the results of operations. The first step is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting 
65 Table of Contents
unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In this second step, the
implied fair value as defined in SFAS 142 of the reporting units goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. As the
Company consists of only one reporting unit, and is publicly traded, management estimates the fair value of its reporting unit utilizing the Companys market capitalization, multiplying the number of actual shares outstanding by a one year
average market price, as reflected on NASDAQ National Market, and applying an additional premium to give effect to the Companys best estimate of a control premium, as if the Company were to be acquired by a single stockholder, which seeks to
give effect to the increased consideration a potential acquirer would be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies, direct operations and make decisions related to the Company. As a result of the decline in the Companys stock price since June30, 2007, which affected the Companys market capitalization, the
Company updated its goodwill impairment test on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2008. A 30% control premium was utilized in the Companys interim and annual goodwill impairment testing. This control premium is not a standard amount based on broad
assumptions; rather, the amount is based on detailed analysis that considers appropriate industry, market, economic and other pertinent factors, including, indications of such premiums from data on recent acquisition transactions. The control
premium is reviewed periodically, taking into consideration current industry, market and economic conditions along with other factors or available information specific to the Companys business. Managements estimate of an appropriate control premium to apply in determining fair value is an important variable in the Companys goodwill
impairment assessment, and is subject to change. A significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial condition and operating results. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date from fiscal year end to the last day of the eleventh month
of the fiscal year. The Company believes the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year is preferable as it provides the Company additional time to complete the impairment test and report the results of that test in the Companys annual
filing on Form 10-K. No impairment charge resulted from the Companys interim goodwill impairment testing. Additionally, the Company
completed its annual impairment test required under SFAS 142 during the fourth quarter and determined that there was no impairment to the recorded goodwill balances in fiscal 2008, 2007, or 2006 See Note 8 Goodwill and Other Non-Current
Assets for additional information. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses high-performance oscilloscopes, serial data analyzers and global communication protocol test
solutions. The Companys products are sold into a broad range of end markets, including  electronics, data storage, automotive/industrial, and military/aerospace markets. Sales occur in all regions of the United
States as well as a many foreign countries. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years. There is no significant concentration of the Companys accounts receivable
portfolio in any customer or geographical region that presents a risk to the Company based on that concentration. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for sales on credit. The
Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Credit losses have been minimal in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. Income
Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the asset and liability method based upon the difference between
the amounts reported for financial reporting and tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying current enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided when it is 
66 Table of Contents
more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon
the generation of future taxable income, reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which related temporary differences become deductible and available tax planning strategies. The Companys policy is not to provide for U.S.
taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are determined to be permanently invested outside the United States. Effective July1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN 48, as amended by FASB Staff Position No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48 FSP-FIN 48-1. FIN 48 prescribes recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires the Company to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit
based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, the Company recognizes the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
upon effective settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit
in the financial statements. Both before and after adoption of FIN 48, interest related to income taxes is included in the provision of income taxes line of the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Foreign Exchange The
Companys foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as the functional currency and translate all assets and liabilities at fiscal year-end exchange rates and all income and expenses at average fiscal year exchange rates with translation
adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated
in a currency other than the functional currency are included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, related to short-term intercompany loans, are recorded in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations as incurred. Intercompany loans that are of a long-term nature are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency Translation, SFAS 52 whereby foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. In fiscal 2006, certain intercompany loans to foreign subsidiaries were considered long-term in nature. During fiscal 2007, management
changed its intention for one intercompany loan to be short-term in nature, and, as required under SFAS 52, foreign exchange gains and losses subsequent to this change in intent are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.
In fiscal 2008, managements intention for this intercompany loan remained short-term in nature and, as such, foreign exchange gains and losses were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred. Financial Instruments Cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, short-term bank debt, and note payable related party reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets equal or approximate their fair
value due to their short term to maturity. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit have variable interest rates and their carrying amounts are considered by management to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value. On October12, 2006,
the Company sold and issued $720 million 40% convertible senior subordinated notes. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $45 million of the outstanding convertible notes, resulting in a remaining balance of $675 million at June28,
2008. The market value of the convertible notes at June28, 2008 was $609 million. Fair value is determined through information obtained from a third party using the latest available market data. See Note 12 Long Term Debt and Capital
Leases for additional information. Derivative Instruments The Company accounts for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Investments and Hedging
Activities, as amended SFAS 133, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in the fair 
67 Table of Contents
value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument is dependent upon whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging
relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. The Companys foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements are not accounted for as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133; therefore, any changes in fair value
of these contracts are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These derivatives are also recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company enters into short-term foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on assets or liabilities denominated in other than the functional currency of
the Company or its subsidiaries. The fair value of the open foreign exchange forward contracts is a net liability of approximately $5,000 at June28, 2008 as compared to net liabilities of approximately $36,000 at June30, 2007 and $02
million at July1, 2006. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded in Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The changes in fair value of the foreign exchange contracts are inversely correlated to changes in the value of certain of the Companys foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. At June28, 2008
and June30, 2007, the notional amounts of the Companys open foreign exchange forward contracts, all with maturities of less than six months, were approximately $163 million and $129 million, respectively. On October16, 2006 in conjunction with the repayment of the term loan See Note 12 Long-term Debt and Capital Leases for additional
information, the Company terminated its interest rate swap with MT Bank. The net interest income earned on the swap was $03 million for the year ended June30, 2007 and is recognized in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and does not enter into
fair value hedges. New Accounting Pronouncements Recent pronouncements not yet adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard. Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding
financial instruments in one of the categories, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. In February2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP FAS
157-2. FSP FAS 157-2 amends FAS 157 to delay the effective date of FAS 157 for non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this statement will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159 SFAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115. This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of SFAS 159 apply only to entities that
elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. SFAS 159 is effective as
of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before November15, 2007, provided the entity also elects to
apply the provision of SFAS 157. Management does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In June 2007, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF 07-3, Accounting for
Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities EITF 07-3. EITF 07-3 addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non-refundable portion
of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities. The EITF concluded that an entity must defer and capitalize non-refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the
related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. EITF 07-3 is effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. Management does not expect that the adoption of EITF 07-3 will
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No141 revised 2007 SFAS 141R, Business Combinations. This statement establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value. SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
December15, 2008. Early adoption is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of SFAS 141R will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161 SFAS161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and
related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a companys financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. SFAS161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the
enhanced disclosures required by SFAS161. In April 2008, the FASB finalized Staff Position No142-3, Determination of
the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP 142-3. This position amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under
SFAS No142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP 142-3 applies to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets and both intangible assets acquired in business
combinations and asset acquisitions. This position is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FSP 142-3 will have on the Companys consolidated
financial position and results of operations. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement FSP APB14-1. This FSP requires cash settled convertible debt to be separated
into debt and equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference
between the bond cash proceeds and this estimated fair value will be recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the bond. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008 and for interim periods within those years and requires retrospective application. Management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will have on the Companys consolidated financial position and
results of operations, which may be material. Recent pronouncements adopted In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No155 SFAS 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Instruments, an amendment of FASB
Statements No133 and 140. SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to separate the derivative from its host if the holder 
69 Table of Contents
elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. It also clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to
the requirements of SFAS 133; establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative
requiring separation; clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and amends FASB Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding a derivative
financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that
begins after September15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF Abstract 06-2 EITF 06-2, Accounting for Sabbatical Leave
and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No43. EITF 06-2 provides guidance that an employees right to a compensated absence under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement should be accrued over the requisite
service period. EITF 06-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. EITF 06-2 allows for adoption through retrospective application to all prior periods or through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The
Company adopted EITF 06-2 beginning July1, 2007 using the cumulative-effect adjustment approach. The effect of this adoption resulted in a decrease to beginning Retained earnings of approximately $02 million, an increase to deferred tax
assets of approximately $01 million and an increase to Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and Deferred revenue and other non-current liabilities of approximately $02 million and $01 million, respectively. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48
was effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006, and was adopted by the Company effective July1, 2007 See Note 11 Income Taxes for additional information. In December 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position EITF 00-19-2, Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements FSP EITF
00-19-2. FSP EITF 00-19-2 specifies that registration payment arrangements should play no part in determining the initial classification and subsequent accounting for the securities to which they relate. FSP EITF 00-19-2 requires the
contingent obligation in a registration payment arrangement to be separately analyzed under SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FASB Interpretation No14, Reasonable Estimations of the Amount of a Loss.
If payment in a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated, a liability should be recorded. FSP EITF 00-19-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. The adoption of this FSP did not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In May 2007, the FASB issued FASB
Staff Position No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48 FSP-FIN 48-1. FSP-FIN 48-1 further clarifies if it is appropriate for an entity to recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit
when the only change since the initial determination is the completion of an examination or audit by a taxing authority. FSP-FIN 48-1 provides that the determination of whether a position is effectively settled should be taken on a case by case
basis; however, positions may be grouped by tax year and considered effectively settled. The adoption of this FSP on July1, 2007 did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements See Note 11 
Income Taxes for additional information. 2. Catalyst Acquisition On September29, 2006, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement among the Company, 2006 Franklin Congress Corporation, a California corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company Sub, Catalyst, and Nader Salehomoum, as Equityholder Representative, pursuant to which Sub merged with and into Catalyst the Catalyst Merger, with Catalyst continuing as the surviving
corporation and as a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. Catalyst is a manufacturer of data bus analysis and emulation tools for advanced serial data communications and strengthens the Companys position in protocol solutions. 
70 Table of Contents
The Catalyst Merger was recorded under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS 141. On
October2, 2006, the effective date of the Catalyst Merger, all shares of common stock of Catalyst issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Catalyst Merger were exchanged for approximately $267 million in cash immediately. In addition,
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, 10% of the stated consideration was placed into escrow for the twelve-month period following the closing of the Catalyst Merger to secure certain indemnification obligations under the terms of the
Merger Agreement. On October2, 2007, approximately $31 million was released from the escrow to the Catalyst stockholders, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company and the former Catalyst
owners agreed to a final indemnification release. The Company received approximately $02 million from the remaining Catalyst escrow balance, representing the indemnification obligation for certain Catalyst inventory, assumed at acquisition. This
amount was recorded as a component of operating income in fiscal 2008. LeCroy paid cash of $315 million, including direct transaction
costs of $26 million, net of cash acquired of $10 million, using proceeds from the Revolver under the Prior Credit Agreement Note 13 Long-term Debt and Capital Leases for additional information, issued a $35 million, 6% promissory note
payable on January2, 2008, to Nader Salehomoum, the former sole shareholder of Catalyst and current employee of the Company and assumed the fair value of certain vested Catalyst stock options totaling $05 million. The Catalyst Merger
consideration is summarized below in thousands:  Cash for shares and certain vested options 26,650
Cash paid in escrow 3,350
Note payable to former shareholder 3,500
Fair value of vested stock options assumed 450
Transaction costs 2,629 Total purchase price 36,579 In connection with the Catalyst Merger, LeCroy assumed Catalysts Stock Option Plan. On
October2, 2006, Catalyst stock option holders approved technical amendments to their stock option grants in anticipation of their assumption by LeCroy pursuant to the Catalyst Merger including, without limitation, amendments reflecting that
any stock option or other award granted thereunder would be exercisable for LeCroy common stock. Pursuant to SFAS No123R, of the 136,826 assumed stock options granted by the Company in exchange for the stock options held by the employees of
Catalyst, the fair value of 36,858 vested options or approximately $450,000 was considered part of the purchase price for Catalyst and the fair value of 99,968 unvested options or approximately $1,196,000, will be charged to compensation expense in
operations as earned by employees over their remaining requisite service periods. The fair value of assumed options was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model in accordance with EITF 99-12, Determination of the Measurement
Date for the Market Price of Acquiror Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination and SFAS 123R See Note 13 Share-Based Compensation for additional information. The Company was required to grant restricted stock to certain former Catalyst employees contingent on the continuation of employment and the percentage
of the escrow paid to the former shareholders of Catalyst twelve months subsequent to the Catalyst Merger. The value of the 26,733 restricted shares that were granted was approximately $02 million. The fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was established based upon the unaudited October1, 2006 balance
sheet of Catalyst, as well as certain assumptions made regarding fair values. The fair value of finished goods inventory is based on estimated selling prices less direct costs to sell and a reasonable profit margin on the selling effort. The fair
value of work in process inventory is based on estimated selling prices less cost to complete, direct costs to sell and a reasonable profit margin on the cost to complete and selling effort. The fair value of the IPRD, purchased technology,
trade name, backlog and manufacturers representative relationships was determined by considering a variety of factors, including; appraisal, comparable transactions, and discounted cash flow approaches. The fair value of the IPRD was
based on the total estimated costs to develop the related technologies less the costs incurred to date for the projects, and the intangible asset values were based on 
71 Table of Contents
estimates of future cash flows associated with those assets. The purchased technology, backlog and manufacturers representative relationships related
to this acquisition are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives ranging from two to fifteen months. It was originally determined that the Catalyst trade name valued at $07 million had an indefinite life. However, during fiscal
2008, the Catalyst trade name failed the impairment test due to a change in the Companys product strategy and, accordingly, a $07 million pre-tax loss was recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations See Note 8 Goodwill and Other Non-Current Assets for additional information. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill. The primary contributors to the Catalyst goodwill, included, isubstantial revenue benefits due to synergies in product offerings and platforms between the
Catalyst and CATC product portfolio; iiexpanded base of industry knowledge; iiieconomies of scale benefits for the protocol products and the complementary strategic fit with the CATC products, including the expansion of protocol
products; and ivopportunity to further strengthen direct sales model with Catalysts already experienced sales team. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.

3.Business Realignment, Restructuring Initiatives and Related Asset Impairments Fiscal 2008 Business Realignment and Related Asset Impairment In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Catalyst tradename failed the impairment test as a result of a change in the Companys product strategy, and therefore, the Company recorded an approximate $07 million
non-cash charge to Selling, general and administrative expense for the impairment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, as a result of
streamlining operational management processes and staffing requirements, the Company recorded severance of approximately $03 million, which was expensed to Selling, general and administrative. This resulted from headcount reductions of three
employees or 07% of the workforce as compared to June30, 2007. As of June28, 2008, approximately $01 million has been paid in cash and approximately $02 million remains in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Severance is estimated to be paid by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009. In the first quarter of
fiscal 2008, primarily as the result of an effort to improve sales effectiveness and channel management, the Company recorded severance of approximately $06 million, which was expensed to Selling, general and administrative. This resulted from
headcount reductions of twelve employees or 27% of the workforce as compared to June30, 2007. As of June28, 2008, approximately $05 million has been paid in cash and approximately $01 million remains in Accrued expenses and other
current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Severance is estimated to be paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2007
Restructuring Initiatives In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, as a result of local economic conditions in Japan, the Company changed
its Japan sales strategy and approved a restructuring plan related to the Japanese operations which resulted in the closure of certain office facilities in Japan, which included lease termination costs. As a result of the office closures, there were
headcount reductions of four employees or 09% of the workforce as compared to July1, 2006. As a result, the Company recorded severance and related expenses of approximately $01 million and facility closure costs of approximately $02
million, which was expensed to Selling, general and administrative. As of June28, 2008, approximately $03 million has been paid in cash and no accrual remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Fiscal 2007 Business Realignment and Related Asset Impairment In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, an intangible asset was written off due to a change in the Companys product strategy and, accordingly, the Company took an approximate $03 million non-cash charge to Cost
of revenues for the impairment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2007, prompted by the acquisition of Catalyst, the Company evaluated
certain business processes and staffing requirements. As a result, the Company recorded severance and related expense of approximately $16 million, of which approximately $03 million was expensed to Cost of revenues, $12 million was expensed to
Selling, general and administrative and $01 million was expensed to Research and development. The implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of thirty-three employees or 72% of the workforce as compared to July1, 2006. As
of June28, 2008, approximately $15 million has been paid in cash and approximately $01 million remains in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Severance and other related amounts under this plan are estimated to be paid by the end
of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, as a result of a change in the Companys organization
stemming from the Catalyst acquisition, the Company recorded severance and related expenses of approximately $04 million, of which approximately $01 million was expensed to Selling, general and administrative and $03 million was expensed to
Research and development. The implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of eleven employees or 24% of the workforce as compared to July1, 2006. Severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid by the end
of fiscal 2007. 
73 Table of Contents
Fiscal 2006 Business Realignment During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company realigned some of its business processes and as a result, incurred severance and related expenses of approximately $04 million, of which approximately $01
million was expensed to Cost of revenues, $01 million was expensed to Research and development and $02 million was expensed to Selling, general and administrative. The implementation of this plan resulted in headcount reductions of sixteen
employees or 35% of the workforce as compared to July2, 2005. As of June28, 2008, severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid.

The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory raw materials and work in progress, included above, amounted to $45 million and $27 million at June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, respectively. In fiscal 2008, the Company recorded an approximate $24 million inventory write-down as a result of a change in the Companys product strategy and
an approximate $08 million charge related to certain inventory recorded at fair value in the purchase accounting of Catalyst, a portion of which the Company was indemnified. These charges totaled approximately $32 million and were recorded to Cost
of revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2007, the Company made certain operational changes as well as realigned
its product strategy. These changes resulted in a write-down of inventory of approximately $34 million which was recorded in Cost of revenues, including inventory recorded at fair value in the purchase accounting of Catalyst. 6.Other Current Assets Other current assets

Other 856 970 12,934 14,453 Goodwill The Company completed the acquisition of its two complementary protocol businesses, CATC, on October29, 2004 and Catalyst, on October2, 2006. These acquisitions were completed because of their strategic
fit with the Companys existing business and because they were of such a nature and size as to establish new products for growth of the Company. Each of the acquisitions resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys consolidated
financial statements. This goodwill arose because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors, including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these products and the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors
at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers. The primary contributors to the CATC goodwill, included,
isubstantial revenue potential, due to synergies in geographic and end-market opportunities; iisynergy benefits derived through the termination of costly third party distributors, using a direct sales model, leveraging an existing
LeCroy worldwide sales-force and customer support infrastructure; iiiaccess to an expanded base of industry knowledge and workforce expertise; ivthe resulting synergies CATC brings to existing operations, particularly the ability to
capitalize on growing serial data test application standards; and vimmediate savings in general and administrative expenses due to elimination of CATCs public company costs. The primary contributors to the Catalyst goodwill, included, isubstantial revenue benefits due to synergies in product offerings and platforms
between the Catalyst and CATC product portfolio; iiexpanded base of industry knowledge; iiieconomies of scale benefits for the protocol products and the complementary strategic fit with the CATC products, including the expansion of
protocol products; and ivopportunity to further strengthen direct sales model with Catalysts already experienced sales team. Under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires the Company to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value. Testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would,
more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Such an event may occur if, for an extended period of time, the market value of the Companys common stock plus a control premium were less than the
carrying value of the Company. As a result of the decline in the Companys stock price since June30, 2007, which affected the
Companys market capitalization, the Company updated its goodwill impairment test as of September29, 2007,December29, 2007, and March29, 2008 respectively, to identify whether a potential impairment of the Companys
recorded goodwill existed. For the first quarter ended September29, 2007 the Companys market capitalization, without regard to a control premium, exceeded its carrying value. For the second quarter testing as of December29, 2007,
the fair value of the Companys reporting unit was determined to be $1428 million, using a 30% control premium, which exceeded the carrying amount by $256 million, or 21%. For the third quarter testing as of March29, 2008, the fair
value of the Companys reporting unit was determined to be $1378 million, using a 30% control premium, 
76 Table of Contents
which exceeded the carrying amount by $185 million, or 155%. For the fourth quarter testing as of May31, 2008, the fair value of the Companys
reporting unit was determined to be $1380 million, using a 30% control premium, which exceeded the carrying amount by $198 million, or 167%. A 30% control premium was utilized in the Companys second quarter, third quarter and annual goodwill impairment testing. This control premium is not a standard amount based on broad assumptions; rather, the amount is based on detailed
analysis that considers appropriate industry, market, economic and other pertinent factors, including, indications of such premiums from data on recent acquisition transactions. The control premium is reviewed periodically, taking into consideration
current industry, market and economic conditions along with other factors or available information specific to the Companys business. The Company determined that there was no impairment to the recorded goodwill balances in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Company did, however, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and 2006, reduce the goodwill by approximately $01
million and $04 million, respectively, as a result of a reversal of a pre-acquisition tax contingency reserve. Additionally, upon adoption of FIN48 on July1, 2007, some accruals for uncertain tax positions related to the acquisition of
CATC were reduced, resulting in a decrease to goodwill of approximately $01 million. Intangible Assets The following table reflects the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the Companys amortizable intangible assets included in Other

million related to amortizable intangible assets with finite lives. Additionally, approximately $07 million related to the Catalyst tradename was included in Intangibles, net at June30, 2007, which had been established as an indefinite-lived
intangible. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Catalyst tradename failed the annual impairment test due to a change in the
Companys product strategy and, accordingly, the Company took an approximate $07 million non-cash charge to Selling, general and administrative expense for the impairment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company realigned its product strategy and cancelled certain engineering programs. The cancellation of these
programs resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of an intangible asset of approximately $03 million which was recorded in Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Amortization expense for those intangible assets with finite lives was approximately $14 million, $30 million, and $26 million for fiscal 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. The cost of an amortizable intangible asset is 
77 Table of Contents
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset. Management estimates intangible assets amortization expense on a
straight-line basis in fiscal 2009 through 2013 will approximate $05 million, $01 million, $01 million, $01 million and $01 million, respectively. 9.Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities Accrued expenses and other liabilities consist of the following in

At June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, $55 million and $49 million, respectively, of the
Companys deferred tax assets were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other current assets, $92 million and $78 million, respectively, were included in Other noncurrent assets, and $03 million and $01 million of foreign
deferred tax liabilities, respectively, were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. During the year ended
June28, 2008, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $80,000. The increase was due to an increase in state investment tax credit carryforwards, which remain uncertain in their utilization, an increase in gross deferred tax assets
due to the adoption of FIN 48 on July1, 2007, partially offset by decreases in the valuation allowance due to the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards in Asia and Europe, and changes surrounding the utilization of such
foreign deferred tax assets. During the year ended June30, 2007, the valuation allowance increased by approximately $14 million.
The increase was primarily due to a change in state tax law, which reduced the probability of utilizing state investment tax credit carryforwards, and losses incurred in Asia, which increased foreign net operating loss carryforwards and uncertainty
surrounding the utilization of deferred tax assets in Asia. A valuation allowance of approximately $17 million existed as of both
June28, 2008 and June30, 2007 for certain tax credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets. Management believes that it
is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the Companys net deductible temporary differences, net of the valuation allowance. The factors that management considered in assessing the likelihood of realization included
forecasted future taxable income, reversal of taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Management will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax
assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and forecasted operating results. Historically, it has been the
practice of the Company to reinvest unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In a previous fiscal year, however, the Company determined that it would repatriate approximately $70 million in future periods from its foreign subsidiaries. The
Company believes repatriation of these earnings will result in additional taxes in the amount of $16 million and provided for that amount in the 2001 tax provision. The cumulative amount of all other undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign
subsidiaries, for which U.S. federal income tax has not been provided, was approximately $77 million and $57 million at June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, respectively. These earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income
taxes, are anticipated to be reinvested permanently outside the United States. Determining the U.S. income tax liability that might result if these earnings were remitted is not practicable. At June28, 2008, the Company had self-generated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $43 million and acquired net
operating loss carryforwards of $53 million available to offset future taxable income. The carryforwards begin to expire at various dates starting in fiscal 2022 through 2027. Self-generated Foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $05 million at June28, 2008 are available to offset future taxable income of certain foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $03 million of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2014, and approximately $02
million of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not have an expiration period. As of June28, 2008, the Company has approximately $14 million of self-generated foreign tax credit carryforwards, $35 million of self-generated state
tax credit carryforwards, $12 million of acquired state tax credit carryforwards, $46 million of self-generated federal general business tax credit carryforwards, and $09 million of acquired federal general business tax credit carryforwards. The
foreign, state and federal tax credits expire at various dates between fiscal 2009 and 2028. Effective July1, 2007, the Company
adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as amended by FASB Staff Position No48-1 FSP-FIN 48-1, Definition
of Settlement in FASB Interpretation 48. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to
take on a tax return. FIN 48 states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying
position is the largest amount of tax benefit greater than 50% 
80 Table of Contents
likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax benefit from an uncertain position
was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained. Under FIN 48, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as non-current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within twelve months of the reporting
date. The impact of adopting FIN 48 and FSP-FIN 48-1 on the Companys consolidated financial statements is summarized below:  BalanceatJune30,2007

The Company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within and outside the United States.
At July1, 2007 and June28, 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes and accrued interest was approximately $101 million and $104 million, respectively, of which approximately $75
million and $78 million, respectively, would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Approximately $26 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits are related to the CATC acquisition, and would reduce goodwill if recognized at
July1, 2007 and June28, 2008. As of June28, 2008, the Company has approximately $104 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which, approximately $27 million are reflected as a non-current liability and approximately $77
million are reflected as a reduction of gross deferred tax assets. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that approximately $11
million of net unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized during the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and impact the Companys effective tax rate. The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties which could be assessed related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of
July1, 2007 and June28, 2008, the total amount of accrued interest and penalties, before federal and, if applicable, state effect, was approximately $57,000 and $87,000, respectively. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S., various states and in foreign jurisdictions. For federal and foreign income tax purposes, the fiscal
2005 through 2008 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities. For state tax purposes, principally California and New York fiscal 2004 through 2008 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities. A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended June28, 2008 follows:  UnrecognizedTax Benefitsinthousands Balance as of July1, 2007 10,075 Additions for current year tax positions 379 Additions for prior year tax positions 272 Reductions of tax positions related to expiration of statute of limitations 347 Reductions of interest related to expiration of statute of limitations 8 Additional interest 38 Balance as of June28, 2008 10,409 In accordance with the Companys accounting policy, both before and after adoption of FIN 48,
interest related to income taxes is included in the provision of income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the year ended June28, 2008, the Company recognized approximately $38,000 for interest expense related to
uncertain tax positions. As of July1, 2007 and June28, 2008, the Company had recorded liabilities for interest expense related to uncertain tax positions in the amounts of $57,000 and $87,000, respectively. The Company made no accrual
for penalties related to income tax positions.

12. Long Term Debt and Capital Leases Credit Agreement On March30,
2007, the Company entered into a $400 million senior, secured, four-year credit agreement with the lenders listed therein and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company MT Bank, as administrative agent for such lenders the
New Credit Agreement, which replaced LeCroys existing credit facility that was entered into on October29, 2004 and subsequently amended. The terms of the New Credit Agreement provided LeCroy with a $400 million revolving
credit facility Revolver, which includes a $50 million swingline loan subfacility and a $50 million letter of credit subfacility. The performance by LeCroy of its obligations under the New Credit Agreement is secured by all of the
assets of LeCroy and its domestic subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by LeCroys domestic subsidiaries. On March30, 2007, the Company borrowed $94 million under the New Credit Agreement which was used to pay the outstanding balance under
LeCroys Prior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes, including the financing of working capital requirements and capital expenditures. Additionally, the termination of the Prior Credit Agreement resulted in a $10 million
write-off of bank deferred financing fees in fiscal 2007. As of June28, 2008, the Company has zero outstanding borrowings against
the Revolver, the letter of credit subfacility or the swingline loan subfacility. Effective as of April26, 2007, LeCroy, in
accordance with New Credit Agreement, entered into a First Modification and Lender Joinder Agreement Joinder Agreement. This Joinder Agreement increased the Companys credit limit to $500 million and added Capital One Bank
formally North Fork Bank to the New Credit Agreement. On May7, 2008, the Company entered into a Second Modification Agreement to modify certain financial and negative covenants of its New Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates equal to, at LeCroys election, 1the higher of athe prime
rate or bthe federal funds rate plus 05% plus an applicable margin based on LeCroys leverage ratio or 2LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on LeCroys leverage ratio. In addition, LeCroy must pay commitment fees during
the term of the New Credit Agreement at rates dependent on LeCroys leverage ratio. The New Credit Agreement contains, among other
things, conditions precedent, covenants, representations and warranties and events of default customary for facilities of this size, type and purpose. Negative covenants include certain restrictions or limitations on, among other things, the
incurrence of indebtedness; liens; consolidations and mergers; investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions; sales of assets subject to customary exceptions for sales of inventory in the ordinary course and sales of equipment in
connection with the replacement thereof in the ordinary course; sale and lease-back transactions; hedging agreements; and restricted payments, including repurchase of a portion of the convertible notes exceeding $220 million, dividends and stock
repurchases. The Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants, measured quarterly, including a minimum interest coverage
ratio, minimum total net worth, maximum leverage ratio, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures. As of June28, 2008, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the New Credit Agreement.
The New Credit Agreement will expire on July15, 2011, unless, in the absence of any default, extended by LeCroy to April1,
2012, contingent on the waiver or extension of the first redemption date of the Companys convertible notes. The Company incurred
approximately $06 million of financing costs in connection with entering into the New Credit Agreement, which were deferred and are being amortized, on a straight line basis, over the term of the New Credit Agreement. At June28, 2008,
approximately $01 million of deferred financing costs were included in Other current assets, and approximately $03 million were included in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Prior Credit Agreement On October29, 2004, the Company entered into a $750 million senior, secured, five-year credit agreement with the lenders listed therein and JP
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., successor to The Bank of New York, as administrative agent for such lenders the Prior Credit Agreement. The terms of the Prior Credit Agreement, as amended thereafter, provided the Company with a $500 million
term loan and a $500 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $10 million swing-line loan sub-facility and a $10 million letter of credit sub-facility. Borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement, reflected interest at variable rates
equal to, at the Companys election, 1the higher of athe prime rate or bthe federal funds rate plus 05%, plus an applicable margin of between 000% and 150% based on the Companys leverage ratio, as defined in the
Prior Credit Agreement, or 2the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR plus an applicable margin of between 125% and 275% based on the Companys leverage ratio. In addition, the Company must pay commitment fees on unused
revolver borrowings during the term of the Prior Credit Agreement at rates between 0375% and 05% dependent upon its leverage ratio. Convertible Debt On October12, 2006, the Company sold and issued $720million in convertible senior
subordinated notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 400%per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on
each April15 and October15, beginning April15, 2007. The Notes are direct, unsecured, senior subordinated obligations of the Company and rank: isubordinate in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and
future secured indebtedness; iiequal in right of payment with all of the Companys existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, and iiisenior in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future
subordinated indebtedness, except that the Notes ranked equally with the $35 million note issued in connection with the Catalyst acquisition, which was subordinated to the Companys credit facility. In connection with the issuance and sale of
the Notes, the Company entered into an indenture dated as of October12, 2006, with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. The terms of the Notes are governed by the indenture. The Notes mature on October15, 2026 unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require the
Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes on each of October15, 2011,October15, 2016 and October15, 2021, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not including, the repurchase date. The Company may, from time to time, at its option repurchase the Notes in the open market. In addition, the Company may redeem the Notes for cash, either in whole or
in part, anytime after October20, 2011 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not including the redemption date. The Notes are convertible
into Company common stock by the holders at an initial conversion rate equal to 687285 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $1455 per share, subject to adjustment as described in
the indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of $1,000 and the conversion value as defined in the indenture and, to the extent that the
conversion value exceeds $1,000, at the Companys election, cash or shares of Company common stock in respect of the remainder. Prior to September15, 2026, holders may convert their notes into cash and shares of the Companys common
stock, if any, at the applicable conversion rate, at their option, only under limited circumstances described in the indenture. On or after September15, 2026, holders may convert their notes into cash and shares of the Companys common
stock, if any, at the applicable conversion price, at the Companys option, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of the notes,
the holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of i$1,000 or iithe conversion value, as described in the indenture; if the conversion value exceeds $1,000 on the conversion date, the Company will also deliver, at the
Companys election, cash or common stock or combination of each with a value equal to such excess. During fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $45 million of the outstanding Notes, leaving a balance of $675 million at June28, 2008. At
June28, 2008 it was the Companys intent to repurchase approximately $55 million of the outstanding notes during fiscal 2009 based on current market conditions. As such, $55 million related to the Notes was included in Accrued expenses
and other current liabilities and $620 million was included in Convertible notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of June28, 2008, the market value of the Notes was $608 million.

The Company evaluated the accounting for the conversion feature in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-19,
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock and related issues, at the date of issuance of the Notes and determined that the conversion feature would be
equity-classified if it were a stand-alone instrument, and, therefore, it does not need to be accounted for separately from the Notes. The Company updates its analysis of the accounting for the conversion feature as circumstances warrant. If the
conversion feature is required to be bifurcated in the future, changes in the fair value of the conversion feature would be charged or credited to interest expense in each period. If the Company undergoes a change in control as defined in the indenture, holders of the Notes will have the right, subject to certain
conditions, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In connection with the sale of its Notes, the Company also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement,
the Company filed a shelf registration statement, which has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering resales by holders of the Notes and any common stock issuable upon conversion of such Notes subject to certain
conditions specified in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the earliest of the following has occurred: iall securities
covered by the registration statement have been sold pursuant to the registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act; iithe holders of the Notes and the shares of the Companys common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Notes that are not affiliates are able to sell all such securities immediately pursuant to Rule 144k under the Securities Act; iiithe date when all of the Notes and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have ceased to be
outstanding; and ivOctober12, 2008. The Company will pay predetermined additional interest on notes that are registrable
securities if the shelf registration statement is unavailable for periods in excess of those permitted under the indenture. The Company believes the likelihood of occurrence of such event is remote and, as such, the Company has not recorded a
liability at June28, 2008. In the event the Company would have to pay additional interest under the registration rights agreement, the Company estimates the maximum potential amount at June28, 2008 to be approximately $03 million per
year. No amounts are owed, nor have any been recorded for failure to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement. The Company
received net proceeds from the sale of the Notes of approximately $690million. Immediately thereafter, the net proceeds from the sale were used to repay the outstanding term debt balance of approximately $319 million under the Companys
Prior Credit Agreement, repurchase of 850,000shares of the Companys common stock at a cost of approximately $99million and repay approximately $228 million of revolving debt under the Companys Prior Credit Agreement that
was drawn down to fund the acquisition of Catalyst. The Company incurred approximately $30 million of transaction fees in connection with
issuing the Notes, which have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the Notes using the effective interest method. The term of the Notes for amortization purposes is considered to be five years in accordance with SAB Topic 3-C,
Redeemable Preferred Stock, as that is the first period in which the redemption feature of the Notes can be executed by either the Noteholders or LeCroy and therefore is considered the mandatory redemption date. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company repurchased $45 million of the outstanding convertible notes. The difference between the net carrying
amount and the repayment of the debt along with the write-off of unamortized fees resulted in an approximate $03 million Gain on extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At June28, 2008, approximately $19 million
of unamortized fees related to the Notes was included in Other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Foreign Credit
Facilities The Company maintains certain short-term foreign credit facilities. There is a Japanese facility totaling 500million
yen approximately $05 million as of June28, 2008. No amounts were outstanding under this facility 
84 Table of Contents
as of June28, 2008 and June30, 2007. The Companys Swiss subsidiary has an overdraft facility totaling 10million Swiss francs
approximately $10 million as of June28, 2008. As of June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, approximately 04million Swiss francs were held against supplier obligations leaving an available balance of 06million Swiss francs
under this credit facility. These obligations to Swiss suppliers, such as rent and utilities, are payable under the credit facility only in the event that the subsidiary is unable to meet its financial obligations to those suppliers. Capital Lease Agreements During
fiscal 2005, the Company entered into vendor supplied capital lease agreements for technology rights of approximately $13 million. These leases bore interest at 45% to 488% and were fully paid by the first quarter of fiscal 2008. At June30,
2007, the Company had outstanding balances under capital lease agreements entered into in a prior year of approximately $01 million. During fiscal 2008, the Company acquired a software license under a capital lease agreement for approximately $07 million. The lease bears interest at 775% with a three-year term. At June28, 2008, the Companys outstanding
balance under this agreement was approximately $06 million, approximately $02 million was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and approximately $03 million was included in Deferred revenue and other non-current liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future minimum lease payments required during fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 are approximately $02 million, $03 million and $01 million, respectively. Other Line of Credit The Company
had a $20 million capital lease line of credit to fund certain capital expenditures that bore interest at an annual rate of 122% on outstanding borrowings. The capital lease line of credit was terminated in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. No
amounts were outstanding as of June28, 2008 and June30, 2007. 13.Share-Based Compensation Total share-based compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007
and July1, 2006 is $47 million, $52 million, and $53 million, respectively. Less than $01 million of compensation cost was
capitalized in inventory or any other assets for the year ended June28, 2008. For the years ended June30, 2007 and July1, 2006, no compensation cost was capitalized in inventory or any other assets. Method of Accounting On
July3, 2005, the start of the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R, which requires that the costs resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their
fair values. The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after the adoption date. With the adoption of
SFAS 123R, unamortized deferred stock compensation relating to previous grants of non-vested stock of $86 million was credited to additional paid-in capital. The Company recorded compensation cost for the non-vested portion of previously granted
stock-based awards outstanding at the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, adjusted for estimated forfeitures as
required by SFAS 123R. Compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards granted after July3, 2005 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. The Company recognizes these
compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of 4 years. The Companys estimated forfeiture rate at adoption was based on its
historical experience. On November10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 123R-3 FSP 123R-3, Transition
Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-based Payment Awards, that provided an elective alternative 
85 Table of Contents
transition method of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R the
APIC Pool to the method otherwise required by paragraph 81 of SFAS 123R. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company made the election to use the alternative method, however, the alternative method did not have an impact on
the Companys results of operations or financial condition due to the Companys net operating loss position. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires that the cash flows resulting from tax
benefits of tax deductions in excess of the book compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. For the years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007, and July1, 2006, there
were no excess tax benefits recognized resulting from share-based compensation cost. Company Stock-Based Plans The Company maintains share-based payment arrangements under the following plans: ithe Amended and Restated 1993 Stock Incentive Plan 1993
Plan, iithe Amended and Restated 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, iiithe Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Plan 1998 Plan, ivthe 2003 Stock Incentive Plan
2003 Plan, vthe 2004 Employment Inducement Stock Plan 2004 Plan, vithe LeCroy Corporation CATC Special 2000 Stock Option Plan, viithe LeCroy Corporation CATC 2000 Stock Incentive Plan,
viiithe LeCroy Corporation CATC 1994 Stock Option Plan items vi, viiand viiicollectively the LeCroy CATC Plans and ixthe LeCroy Catalyst 2005 Stock Option Plan. The Company has a policy of issuing
new shares of its common stock to satisfy share option exercises. Shares available for grant under all company stock-based plans were
495,660 and 901,008 at June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, respectively. These amounts include 285,680 shares at June 28, 2008 and 394,285 at June 30, 2007 under the ESPP Plan. The 1993 Plan expired on January4, 2003. All options outstanding under the 1993 Plan at the time of its expiration will continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. The lives of the options are generally ten years from the date of grant. In October 1998, the Board
of Directors and stockholders terminated the 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan and adopted the 1998 Plan. As of June28, 2008, stock options to purchase 901 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the 1995
Plan are outstanding and fully vested. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, each non-employee director receives upon initial election to the Board of Directors either a stock option grant of 15,000 shares to vest ratably over 36 months, or a restricted stock
award of 10,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to such vesting and other conditions and restrictions as the Board may determine at its discretion. In fiscal 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors revised the Board compensation
such that each non-employee director will receive annually, an immediately vested restricted stock award equal to $95,000, based on the closing price of the Companys Common Stock on the Annual Shareholder Meeting date, rounded up or down to
the nearest hundred shares. The compensation was effective for equity awards granted at the October31, 2007 Annual Shareholder Meeting, which resulted in 9,700 shares being granted to each non-employee director. Prior to fiscal 2008, each
non-employee director received annually, a restricted stock award of 5,000 shares of Common Stock subject to such vesting and other conditions and restrictions as the Board may determine at its discretion. A total of 500,000 shares of Common Stock
can be issued during the term of the 1998 Plan. The 1998 Plan expires on October27, 2010. The 2003 Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards to employees including officers and employee directors and consultants. Unless approved by stockholders owning a majority of shares present and entitled to vote at a
duly convened meeting of stockholders of the Company, the purchase price of any option granted under the 2003 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The aggregate number of shares of
Common Stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to options or restricted stock awards under the 2003 Plan is 1,560,167 shares. The 2003 Plan also allows for awards based on performance criteria which awards may then qualify as
performance-

based compensation under Section162m of the Internal Revenue Code. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 2003
Plan and has the authority to determine the terms of such options or awards including the number of shares, exercise or purchase prices and times at which the options become and remain exercisable or restricted stock is no longer restricted. There
have been no performance-based awards granted under the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan expires on October29, 2013. In connection with the
CATC Merger, on October29, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2004 Plan to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by strengthening the Companys ability to attract and induce persons to become
employees of the Company, including certain of CATCs employees. The adoption of the 2004 Plan did not require stockholder approval. The number of shares of LeCroy common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to options or restricted
stock awards granted under the 2004 Plan is 750,000 shares. On October29, 2004, the Company issued the following grants under the 2004 Plan: i70,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain former officers of CATC, and
iioptions to purchase an aggregate of 230,984 shares of common stock to 61 former CATC employees who became non-officer employees of LeCroy none of whom received an option grant of more than 20,000 shares. The options were issued with
vesting periods of four to six years. On September13, 2005, the Board of Directors resolved that no further grants would be made under the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan expires on October29, 2014. In connection with the CATC Merger, LeCroy assumed the LeCroy CATC Plans. On October27, 2004, the Board of Directors of CATC approved technical
amendments to each of the CATC Stock Plans in anticipation of their assumption by LeCroy pursuant to the CATC Merger including, without limitation, amendments reflecting that any stock option or other award granted thereunder would be exercisable
for LeCroy common stock. Pursuant to SFAS No141 and FIN 44, the 648,284 unvested stock options, as well as certain vested but unexercised stock options, granted by the Company in exchange for the stock options held by the employees of CATC
were considered part of the purchase price for CATC. The $51 million fair value of the new awards was included in the purchase price, less the intrinsic value of unvested options of $19 million, which, during the period from October29, 2004
to June30, 2005, was being charged as compensation expense to operations on a straight-line basis as earned by employees over their remaining vesting periods. In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R, the remaining unamortized deferred
compensation was eliminated against additional paid-in capital on the date of adoption and compensation cost for unvested options under the LeCroy CATC Plans is being recognized over the remaining vesting period using the fair value of the options
on the date of the CATC Merger. On September13, 2005, the Board of Directors resolved that no further grants would be made under the LeCroy CATC Plans. In connection with the Catalyst Merger, LeCroy assumed Catalysts 2005 Stock Option Plan. On October2, 2006, Catalyst stock option holders approved technical amendments to their stock option grants in
anticipation of their assumption by LeCroy pursuant to the Catalyst Merger including, without limitation, amendments reflecting that any stock option or other award granted thereunder would be exercisable for LeCroy common stock. Pursuant to SFAS
No123R, of the 136,826 assumed stock options granted by the Company in exchange for the stock options held by the employees of Catalyst, the fair value of 36,858 vested options or approximately $450,000 was considered part of the purchase
price for Catalyst and the fair value of 99,968 unvested options or approximately $1,196,000, is charged to compensation expense in operations as earned by employees over their remaining requisite service periods. The fair value of assumed options
was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The public announcement of the Catalyst Merger occurred on the same date as
the closing, October2, 2006. Upon completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option issued by Catalyst was assumed by LeCroy and was converted into an option to purchase that number of shares of LeCroy common stock equal to the number of
shares of Catalyst common stock purchasable pursuant to the Catalyst option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of LeCroy common stock. The
exercise price per share was equal to the exercise price per share of Catalyst common stock divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Companys assumption of the Catalyst issued options was treated as a
modification, under SFAS No123R, of the terms of the original Catalyst grant. The same conversion formula was utilized to calculate the number of assumed options as was used in the Merger consideration and, as such, the aggregate fair value
of Catalysts awards immediately prior to the Merger was substantially similar to the aggregate fair value of the LeCroy awards on the date of grant. 
87 Table of Contents
Stock Options and Assumptions The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are calculated
based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. Management monitors share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company analyzed its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options and the amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the Companys actual
forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods. The
expected holding period of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of a 5-year U.S. Treasury note in effect on the date of the grant or such
other period that most closely equals the expected term of the option. The table below presents the assumptions used to calculate the fair
value of options granted during the fiscal years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007 including Catalyst assumed options in fiscal 2007 and July1, 2006:  Years Ended June28,2008

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during each of the years ended June28,
2008, June30, 2007 and July1, 2006 was approximately $03 million, $05 million and $05 million, respectively. As of
June28, 2008, there was approximately $07 million, of unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related to stock options granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
approximately 18 years. Non-Vested Stock and Assumptions The fair value of new grants is determined based on the closing price on the date of grant. Related compensation expense is recognized ratably over the
associated requisite service period, giving effect to estimated forfeitures. If the Companys actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based
compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods.

Consolidated Balance Sheets. Non-vested stock is not included in the weighted average share calculation for basic earnings per share. However, the dilutive effect of the non-vested stock is included in the weighted average share calculation for
diluted earnings per share. Of the shares granted, 48,500 shares were issued under the 1998 Plan to non-employee directors and were
immediately vested and the remaining 177,817 shares were issued to employees under the 2003 Plan. Of the shares issued to employees, vesting periods are generally four years from the date of grant, however there are certain grants with vesting
periods less than four years. As of June28, 2008, there was approximately $37 million of unrecognized compensation cost net of
estimated forfeitures related to non-vested stock granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 25 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Assumptions The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP with a look-back option that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the market value at the lower of either the date of enrollment or the date of
purchase. Payment for the ESPP is a fixed amount, set at the beginning of the period, made through payroll withholding over the enrollment period of six months. The number of shares the participant can acquire is variable based on the fixed amount
withheld and the applicable fair value. SFAS No123R requires an ESPP with a purchase price discount of greater than 5% and a look-back option to be compensatory. The Company accounts for the ESPP in accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin
No97-1, Accounting under Statement 123 for Certain Employee Stock Purchase Plans with a Look-Back Option. The fair value of the put and call features of the estimated shares to be purchased are estimated at
the beginning of the purchase period using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are calculated based on the historical six-month volatility of the Companys stock. The expected holding period is equal to the six-month
enrollment period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of a six-month U.S. Treasury note in effect on the first day of the enrollment period. The fair value of the shares is liability classified until the end of the six-month
period at which time the amount is then equity classified. As of both June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, there is approximately $41,000 of liability classified share-based compensation expense for the ESPP included in Accrued expenses and
other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The ESPP has reserved for issuance an aggregate of 1,060,000 shares of
Common Stock and is set to expire on November30, 2011. The purpose of the ESPP is twofold: first, to encourage stock ownership by employees by establishing a program that permits them to purchase shares of Common Stock on a regular basis
through payroll deductions; and second, to offer employees an opportunity, without adverse tax consequences, to purchase stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value on the first or last business day of the offering period. In fiscal 2008,
108,605 shares were issued under the ESPP.

Stock Appreciation Rights and Assumptions On August20, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2007 Stock Appreciation Right Plan theSAR Plan. Under the
SAR Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may award stock appreciation rights to eligible employees. Each stock appreciation right SAR awarded represents the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the excess
of the fair market value of a share of the Companys common stock on the date that a participant exercises such right over the fair market value of a share of the Company common stock on the date that such SAR was awarded. Awards of SARs
will vest in four successive annual installments of 25% of the SARs subject to such award on the anniversary of the date of the grant of such award. The employee will have four years from the date of vesting of an installment in which to exercise
such installment. The SAR Plan will terminate on August20, 2017. On August20, 2007, the Company granted 712,000 SARs. The
exercise price of the SARs was set at $760 per share, which equaled the closing price of the Companys common stock on the grant date. The fair value at grant date was $361, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities
are calculated based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. Management monitors award exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates. If the Companys actual forfeiture rate is materially different
from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods. The expected holding period of SARs represents
the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of a 5-year U.S. Treasury note in effect on the date of the grant or other such period that is closest to the expected
term of the SARs. At June28, 2008, 712,000 SARS were outstanding with a weighted average remaining contractual term of 565 years and an intrinsic value of approximately $890,000. The Company records compensation expense ratably over the service period and adjusts for changes in the fair value of SARs at each reporting period.
Based on the fair value of $379 per SAR on June28, 2008 there was approximately $19 million of unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related to SARs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period
of approximately 31 years. The table below presents the assumptions used to remeasure the value of the SARs at June28, 2008:
June28,2008 Expected holding period years 45 Risk-free interest rate 314 Dividend yield 00 Expected volatility 4036 Fair value of SARs granted 379
The fair value of the SARs is liability classified because the awards are payable in cash. As of
June28, 2008, there was approximately $06 million of liability classified share-based compensation expense for the SARs included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 14.Common Stock, Treasury Stock and Warrants to Purchase Common Stock On May25, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved the adoption of a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to purchase up to 20million shares, not to exceed $250 million, of its
common stock for treasury. During fiscal 2008, the Company purchased 297,523 shares for a total consideration of approximately $24 million. During fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively, the Company purchased 896,000 shares and 142,283 shares
for a total consideration of approximately $105 million and $19 million. During the year ended June30, 2007, the Company retired 10million shares of its treasury stock. These shares are authorized but unissued. Purchases under this buyback program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including pursuant to the
terms of a 10b5-1 plan. A 10b5-1 plan allows a company to

purchase shares during a blackout period, provided the company communicates its share purchase instructions to the broker prior to the blackout period,
pursuant to a written plan that may not be changed. The timing of these purchases is dependent upon several factors, including market conditions, the market price of the Companys common stock, the effect of the share dilution on earnings,
available cash and any other potential risks the Company may encounter. The share repurchase plan may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Company. At July1, 2006 the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase 28,571 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $1750 per share. These warrants expired on August15, 2006. No warrants were exercised
during the fiscal years ended June30, 2007 and July1, 2006 and there are no warrants outstanding as of June28, 2008. 15.Net
Income Loss Per Common Share EPS Basic net income loss per common share is net income loss divided by the weighted average of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income loss per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect of shares from the assumed exercise of dilutive stock
options, convertible debt if dilutive and non-vested stock using the treasury stock method. The following is a presentation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted net income loss per common share computations for the
years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007 and July1, 2006 in thousands:  Years Ended June28,2008
June30,2007 July1,2006
Numerator Net income loss 1,712 13,207 6,573 Denominator Weighted average shares outstanding Basic 11,749 11,702 12,218
Employee stock options and non-vested stock 258 256 Diluted 12,007 11,702 12,474 The computations of diluted EPS for the years ended June28, 2008, June30, 2007 and
July1, 2006 do not include approximately 17million, 26million and 17million, respectively, of stock options and non-vested stock, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to EPS. For the years ended
June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, the convertible notes had no impact on diluted EPS because the average share price during the fiscal years was below $1455 per share the initial conversion price, and accordingly, the Notes, if
converted, would have required only cash at settlement. 16.Stockholder Rights Plan On November2, 1998, the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right in respect to each share of LeCroys
Common Stock outstanding at the record date, November18, 1998. To date, the rights have been traded together with the Common Stock and are not exercisable or separately tradable. The rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires, in
the future, 15% or more of the Companys common stock or announces a tender offer. Right holders, other than the acquiring person or group, are then entitled to purchase an amount of the Companys common stock at a 50% discount to the
share price at that time. The number of shares of common stock that a right holder is entitled to purchase is based on the exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the right will entitle the stockholder to buy shares in an acquiring entity at a
discount. The Board of Directors may redeem the rights at a price of $0001 per right up until 10 days following a public announcement
that any person or group has acquired 15% or more of LeCroys Common Stock. The rights will expire on November2, 2008, unless redeemed prior to that date. The rights plan had no impact on the financial position or results of operations of
the Company.

17.Employee Benefit Plans The Company has an employee 401k savings plan. It is a trusted, employee 401k savings plan for eligible U.S. employees under which it contributes an unconditional match of up to 50% of employee contributions up to
a maximum employer contribution of 5% of the employees eligible compensation, as defined. For the fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company has expensed approximately $05 million, $06 million and $06 million, respectively, in matching
contributions to this plan. The Companys subsidiary in Switzerland maintains a defined contribution plan, which requires employee
contributions based upon a percentage of the employees earnings, as defined, currently ranging from 46% to 84%. The Company makes a matching contribution based also upon a percentage of the employees earnings, as defined, currently
ranging from 54% to 96%. For fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company has expensed $05 million, $05 million, and $04 million, respectively, in matching contributions to this plan. 18.Segment Reporting and Geographic Information The Company operates in a single-reportable
segment in the test and measurement market, in which it develops, manufactures, sells and licenses high-performance oscilloscopes, serial data analyzers and global communication protocol test solutions. These products are used by design engineers
and researchers to measure and analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high performance systems, to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market. Revenue from the sale of the Companys products, which are similar in
nature, are reflected as Test and measurement product revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues are attributed to
countries based on customer ship-to addresses. Revenues by geographic area are as follows in thousands:  June28,2008

No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues in any of the last
three fiscal years. Revenues attributable to individual countries based on customer ship-to addresses that account for 10% or more of total revenues in fiscal 2008 include the United States approximately $484 million and Germany approximately
$213 million. In fiscal 2007, the United States and Germany accounted for approximately $509 million and $167 million, respectively and in fiscal 2006, the United States and Germany accounted for approximately $460 million and $173 million,
respectively. 19.Commitments and Contingencies The Companys contractual obligations and commitments include obligations associated with employee severance agreements See Note 3 Business Realignment, Restructuring Initiatives and Related Asset
Impairments for additional information, supplier agreements, operating leases, capital leases and convertible note obligations See Note 12 Long Term Debt and Capital Leases for additional information. Operating Leases and Supplier Agreements Operating leases covering plant, certain office facilities and equipment expire at various dates in the future. Future minimum annual lease payments required during fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and
thereafter, under non-cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year, are approximately $20 million, $11 million, $04 million, $01 million, $01 million and zero, respectively. Aggregate rental expense on
non-cancelable operating leases for the fiscal years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006 approximated $27 million, $26 million and $21 million, respectively. As of June28, 2008, the Company is committed to purchase approximately $05 million of inventory from suppliers. Environmental The Companys former subsidiary, Digitech Industries, Inc.
Digitech, was notified prior to 1999 by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection the DEP that it may be responsible for environmental damage that occurred at its previously leased facilities in Ridgefield,
Connecticut the Ridgefield Site. Based upon recommendations made by the DEP, Digitech engaged environmental consultants to assist it in evaluating the costs associated with the DEPs recommendations for monitoring and remediation
of the environmental damage. In May 1999, LeCroy, Digitech and the former owners of the Ridgefield Site entered into an agreement with the
current owners of the Ridgefield Site. The current owners purchased an insurance policy providing for $20 million of coverage against certain environmental liabilities related to the Ridgefield Site. That insurance policy names both LeCroy and
Digitech as insured parties. The current owners of the Ridgefield Site also agreed to remediate all environmental problems associated with the property and to obtain all applicable approvals and certifications from the DEP. The current owners of the
Ridgefield Site also agreed to hold both LeCroy and Digitech harmless in the event of a claim made against them relating to these environmental matters. In return for the above, forty-five days after the DEP has provided written notification to the
Company that the site remediation has been accomplished to its satisfaction, the Company agreed to pay the former owners of the Ridgefield Site $02 million as compensation for the reduced sale value of the property due to the environmental problems
existing on the site. In August 2000, the Company closed the sale of the assets and business of its Vigilant Networks, Inc. subsidiary
Vigilant and a portion of the assets and business of its Digitech subsidiary for gross proceeds of $120 million. The remaining business of Digitech was classified as discontinued operations. The Company has accrued retained
liabilities from discontinued operations of $02 million after the sale of the Vigilant business and the residual assets of Digitech, which amount is recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the June28, 2008 and
June30, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Legal From time to time, the Company may be involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including patent and environmental matters, which
arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters pending that the Company expects to have a material adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

20.Related Party Transactions On October20, 2000, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a $03 million five-year loan to Thomas H. Reslewic, LeCroys Chief Executive Officer and President, secured by
Mr.Reslewics non-qualified stock options. The loan accrued interest at 95% compounded annually with interest payable at the maturity of the loan. If Mr.Reslewic remained an employee of LeCroy for the entire five-year term of the
loan or was terminated without cause prior to the maturity date of the loan, the Company would forgive the loan principal and all accrued interest. The loan was amortized on a straight-line basis and the compensation expense was recorded within
Selling, general and administrative expenses. The loan reached maturity in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and was forgiven along with the accrued interest, in accordance with the agreement. On July19, 2005 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a $03 million retention bonus to Mr.Reslewic. This retention
bonus requires Mr.Reslewic to remain an employee for five years. If Mr.Reslewic terminates his employment earlier than five years, he will be required to repay the bonus in full. The retention bonus is being amortized over five years on
a straight line basis as compensation expense. At June28, 2008, a total of approximately $01 million remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, included in Other current assets and Other non-current assets. In conjunction with the Catalyst acquisition, the Company issued a $35 million, 6% promissory note payable on January2, 2008, to Nader Salehomoum,
the former sole shareholder of Catalyst and current employee of the Company. In fiscal 2008, the note was fully repaid. 21.Derivative Instruments
The Company has or had the following derivative instruments: Interest Rate Swap As required by the
terms of the Companys Prior Credit Agreement See Note 12 Long-term Debt and Capital Leases for additional information, on January27, 2005 the Company entered into a Master Agreement for an interest rate swap with MT Bank,
the purpose of which was to protect against rising interest rates during the term of the Credit Agreement. On October16, 2006 in
conjunction with the repayment of the term loan See Note 12 Long-term Debt and Capital Leases for additional information, the Company terminated its interest rate swap with MT Bank. The net interest income earned on the swap was
approximately $03 million for fiscal 2007 and $01 million for fiscal 2006 and is recognized in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Forward foreign exchange contracts The Company enters into short-term forward exchange agreements
to purchase foreign currencies at set rates in the future. These foreign currency forward exchange agreements are used to limit exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than the Companys functional currency. Subsidiaries may also use forward exchange agreements to offset the foreign currency risk for receivables and payables not denominated in, or indexed to, their functional currencies. The Company records
these short-term forward exchange agreements on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognized currently in Other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, foreign currency losses on these derivatives and on transactions denominated in other than their functional
currencies, were approximately $06 million, $03 million and $03 million, respectively. At June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, the notional amounts of the Companys open foreign exchange forward contracts, all with maturities of less
than six months, were approximately $163 million and $129 million, respectively.

22. Iwatsu Settlement/Purchase Agreement On March22, 2006, the Company completed a purchase and settlement agreement with Iwatsu Electric Company, Ltd. Iwatsu for a total of
approximately $36 million, which included the settlement of an underlying dispute between the Company and Iwatsu relating to the ownership of intellectual property contained in Iwatsus ViewGo product line, a non-compete agreement, whereby
Iwatsu agreed not to engage in competition with the Company for a period of ten years, and the purchase of certain other intellectual property rights unrelated to the ViewGo product line. The Company obtained an independent third-party appraisal to
value these elements of the Iwatsu agreement. As a result of the appraisal, in fiscal 2006, the Company expensed approximately $28 million of the total purchase price as a legal settlement. An approximate $08 million was recorded as intangible
assets of which $05 million is being amortized over the 10-year estimated life of the non-compete agreement and $03 million is being amortized over the 7-year estimated useful life of the acquired intellectual property assets. The ViewGo product
line was re-engineered by the Company and launched as the WaveJet family of products during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During the
fiscal years ended 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately $01 million, $01 million and $31,000, respectively was amortized to Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the Iwatsu acquired intangibles. 23.Unaudited Quarterly Results of Operations The Company has quarterly periods ending on the Saturday closest to the end of the month.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES The Company, under the
supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rule13a-15e under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms, and 2accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act during the quarter ended June28, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that management document and test the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting and include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. See Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. In addition, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June28, 2008 and has issued their report thereon, also
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the guidelines established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of June28, 2008. In addition, KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of June28, 2008 and has issued their report thereon. That report appears below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders LeCroy Corporation: We have audited LeCroy Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June28, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. LeCroy Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, LeCroy Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June28, 2008,
based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of LeCroy Corporation and subsidiaries as of June28, 2008 and June30, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended June28, 2008,June30, 2007,
and July1, 2006, and our report dated September9, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG
