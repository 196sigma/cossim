CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  a Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.  We have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form
10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  b Reports of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Report of Synplicity Inc. Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our 
41 Table of Contents
managements assessment, it believes that, as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which appears below.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Synplicity, Inc.  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Report of Synplicity Inc. the Company Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our
opinion, managements assessment that Synplicity, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
Synplicity, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance
sheets of Synplicity, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and our report dated March
2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  Palo Alto, California
