Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
PetMed Express, Inc. and subsidiaries, d/b/a 1-800-PetMeds the Company, is a leading nationwide pet pharmacy. The Company markets prescription and non-prescription pet medications, health products, and supplies for dogs and cats, direct to the consumer. The Company markets its products through national television, online, and direct mail/print advertising campaigns, which aim to increase the recognition of the 1-800-PetMeds brand name and PetMeds family of trademarks, increase traffic on its website at www1800petmeds.com, acquire new customers, and maximize repeat purchases. The majority of all of the Company sales are to residents in the United States. The Companys executive offices are located in Pompano Beach, Florida. The Company fiscal year end is March 31, and references herein to fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009 refer to the Company fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue by selling pet medication products and pet supplies mainly to retail consumers. The Companys policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment, when the rights of ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer. Outbound shipping and handling fees are included in sales and are billed upon shipment. Shipping expenses are included in cost of sales. The majority of the Companys sales are paid by credit cards and the Company usually receives the cash settlement in two to three banking days. Credit card sales minimize the accounts receivable balances relative to sales. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that the Company estimates will arise from the customers inability to make required payments, arising from either credit card charge-backs or insufficient funds checks. The Company determines its estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts and current economic trends. At March 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $6,000 and $5,000, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2011 and 2010 consisted of the Companys cash accounts and money market accounts with a maturity of three months or less. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.
Short and Long Term Investments
The Companys short term investment balance consists of short term bond mutual funds. The Companys long term investment balance consists of auction rate securities ARS, which are investments with contractual maturities generally between 20 to 30 years, in the form of municipal bonds and preferred stock, whose interest rates reset, typically every seven to twenty-eight days, through an auction process. At the end of each reset period, investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par. Beginning in February 2008, auctions failed for the ARS held because sell orders exceeded buy orders. These failures are not believed to be a credit issue, but rather are caused by a lack of liquidity. The funds associated with these failed auctions may not be accessible until the issuer calls the security, a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, or the security matures. 30 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
As a result, these securities with failed auctions have been classified as long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the fact that they were not currently trading at such date, and conditions in the general markets created uncertainty as to when successful auctions would be reestablished. These ARS are recorded at estimated fair value and have variable interest rates that are recorded as interest income. In accordance with ASC Topic 320 SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, short term investments and long term investments are classified as available-for-sale, with any changes in fair value to be reflected in other comprehensive income. The Company evaluates its long term investments for impairment and whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and, if other- than-temporary, then the measurement of the impairment loss is a charge to net income. Unrealized gains and losses are deemed temporary and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognized a temporary impairment on its ARS investments during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. The Company does not believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets has been impacted; however the temporary impairment is mainly due to the lack of liquidity. The Company is currently trying to liquidate all ARS. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories consist of prescription and non-prescription pet medications and pet supplies that are available for sale and are priced at the lower of cost or market value using a weighted average cost method. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence. The inventory reserve was approximately $63,000 and $73,000 at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The furniture, fixtures, equipment, and computer software are depreciated over periods ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital lease agreements are amortized over the shorter of the underlying lease agreement or the useful life of the asset.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset.
Intangible Asset
The intangible asset consists of a toll-free telephone number and an internet domain name. In October 2008, the Company paid $485,000 for expenses related to acquiring the internet domain name, www.petmed.com. In accordance with the ASC Topic 350 SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets the intangible assets are not being amortized, and are subject to an annual review for impairment. 31 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Advertising
The Company advertising expenses consist primarily of television advertising, online marketing, and direct mail/print advertising. Television advertising costs are expensed as the advertisements are televised. Internet costs are expensed in the month incurred and direct mail/print costs are expensed when the related catalogs, brochures, and postcards are produced, distributed, or superseded.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
Comprehensive Income
The Company applies ASC Topic 220 SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income which requires that all items that are recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The items of other comprehensive income that are typically required to be displayed are foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities. The Company evaluates its long term investments for impairment and whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss as a charge to net income. Unrealized gains and losses are deemed temporary and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. At March 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 the Company recognized a temporary impairment on its ARS investments, and this unrealized loss was included in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income 20,838 26,114 22,756 Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of ASC Topic 740 SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes which generally requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax benefits or consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable years in which those differences are expected to reverse. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 740 FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. As required by FIN 48, which clarifies ASC Topic 740 SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes the Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. At the adoption date, the Company applied FIN 48 to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open. The Company files tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Florida and Georgia. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before March 31, 2008. 32 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Upon implementing FIN 48, the Company did not recognize any additional liabilities for unrecognized tax positions. The adoption of FIN 48 had no material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in fiscal 2011. Any interest and penalties related to income taxes will be recorded to other income expenses.
Business Concentrations
The Company purchases its products from a variety of sources, including certain manufacturers, domestic distributors, and wholesalers. We have multiple suppliers for each of our products to obtain the lowest cost. There were seven suppliers from whom we purchased approximately 50% of all products in fiscal 2011, compared to five suppliers from whom we purchased approximately 50% of all products in fiscal 2010.
Accounting for Share Based Compensation
The Company records compensation expense associated with stock options and restricted stock in accordance with ASC Topic 718 SFAS No123R, Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. The Company adopted the modified prospective transition method provided under ASC Topic 718 SFAS No123R. The compensation expense related to all of the Companys stock-based compensation arrangements is recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
2
Long Term Investments
The long term investment balances consist of ARS investments. Our ARS consist of closed-end fund preferred ARS, with interest rates that reset, typically every seven to twenty-eight days. These ARS are currently rated AAA, the highest rating available by a rating agency. The fair value of our ARS investments was assessed by management with the assistance of an outside third party appraisal firm, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. As of March 31, 2011, the Company held $125 million in ARS, at par, which were classified as long term investments and the Company recorded an unrealized impairment loss of approximately $2,000 for the year then ended. As of March 31, 2011, cumulative losses of $110,000 were recognized within the accumulated other comprehensive loss account. The $110,000 impairment was recorded as temporary due to the fact that the Company has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until anticipated recovery or maturity, and does expect to fully recover the cost basis of the investment. 
3
Fair Value Measurements
Effective April1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC Topic 820 SFAS 157, except as it applies to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities subject to ASC Topic 320 FSP SFAS 157-2. ASC Topic 320 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. ASC Topic 820 SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value Level1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level2 - Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level3 - Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity. 33 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
3
Fair Value Measurements Continued
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The Companys cash equivalents are classified within Level 1, with the exception of the investments in ARS. The Companys investments in ARS are classified within Level 3 because they are valued using a discounted cash flow model. Some of the inputs to this model are unobservable in the market and are significant.

12,392 Long term investments measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs are comprised of ARS. Although ARS would typically be measured using Level 2 inputs, the recent failure of auctions and the lack of market activity and liquidity required that these securities be measured using Level 3 inputs. The Companys ARS consist of closed-end fund preferred ARS, with interest rates that reset, typically every seven to twenty-eight days. The fair value of our ARS investments was assessed by management with the assistance of an outside third party appraisal firm, which was conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The three inputs used in determining the fair values of the ARS were 1
Forecasted interest payments cash flows - In failed ARS auctions interest rates are set by the terms of the prospectus. For almost all of the securities the terms are a combination of two components: the determination of a base rate which is based on the maximum of two indexes, or a single index as defined in the prospectus. Base rates are adjusted through either a multiplication factor or an addition of a spread factor as defined in the prospectus which is dependent on the credit rating of the security. Our ARS are currently rated AAA, the highest rating available by a rating agency. 34 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Discount rate calculation - The discount rates were calculated from the applicable forward curve plus a credit risk/liquidity spread. The credit risk spread was estimated via the credit spreads for 1-3 year term, AAA rated, debt over US Treasury notes and bonds which were determined to be 50 basis points 050%. To address the continued illiquidity of the Companys ARS portfolio, an additional spread of 030% was added to the credit risk spread. This spread is based on the required yield attributable to liquidity for AAA rated debt, as determined by empirical studies. Specifically, research on municipal bond yields indicate that for AAA rated securities, the liquidity component represents approximately 7-10% of the required yield. In total, a credit risk/liquidity spread of 080% was utilized.

A present value calculation was performed utilizing the cash flow of the forecasted interest payments combined with the discount rate determined above. 
As of March 31, 2011, the Company held $125 million in ARS, at par, which were classified as long term investments and the Company recorded an unrealized impairment loss of approximately $2,000 for the year then ended. As of March 31, 2011, cumulative losses of $110,000 were recognized within the accumulated other comprehensive loss account, based upon an assessment by the outside third party appraisal firm. The $110,000 impairment was recorded as temporary due to the fact that the Company has the intent and the ability to hold these securities until anticipated recovery or maturity, and does expect to fully recover the cost basis of the investment.

Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with that in the financial statements.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by a team of consultants and appropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by our Companys Board of Directors, applicable to all Company Directors and all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Audit Committee Committee of our Companys Board of Directors, comprised solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC listing standards, the Exchange Act and the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors and management periodically to discuss internal control over financial reporting, and auditing and financial reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors without management present to ensure that the independent auditors have free access to the Committee. Our Audit Committees Report can be found in the Companys 2011 Proxy Statement.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011.
The Companys independent auditors, McGladrey Pullen, LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors, subject to ratification by our Companys shareholders. McGladrey Pullen, LLP have audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements of PetMed Express, Inc. and subsidiaries, and issued a report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders
PetMed Express,Inc We have audited PetMed Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries hereafter referred to as PetMed internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. PetMeds management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that a pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; b provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and c provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, PetMed Express, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
