REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Metals USA, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Metals USA, Inc.
a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Metals
USA, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
Metals USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Metals USA was founded on
July 3, 1996 to become a leading national value-added metals processor and
distributor, to manufacture higher-value components from processed metals and to
pursue the consolidation of the highly fragmented metals processing industry.
Prior to its initial public offering IPO, Metals USA had conducted no
operations. Concurrent with the consummation of its IPO on July 11, 1997, Metals
USA acquired, in separate transactions the Mergers eight companies the
Founding Companies engaged in the processing of steel, aluminum and specialty
metals, as well as the manufacture of metal components. Following the IPO and
through December 31, 2000, Metals USA acquired numerous additional metal
processing companies and businesses See Note 2. Certain of the companies
acquired after the IPO were accounted for using the pooling-of-interests
method, resulting in a restatement of the Company consolidated financial
statements for all periods presented See Note 2. References herein to the
Company include Metals USA and its subsidiaries.
The Company sells to businesses such as the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. The Company believes that its broad
customer base and its wide array of metals processing capabilities, products and
services, coupled with its broad geographic coverage of the United States,
reduce the Company susceptibility to economic fluctuations affecting any one
industry or geographical area.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to
exist as of the date the financial statements are published and iii the
reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods
presented. The Company reviews all significant estimates affecting its
consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of
any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Adjustments made with
respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not
previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and
assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Metals USA and its subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial
statements to be consistent with the current year presentation, primarily
relating to the segment disclosure see Note 11.
Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries use the last-in, first-out LIFO method
of accounting for inventories and other subsidiaries use a variety of methods
including specific identification, average cost and the first-in first-out
FIFO method of accounting. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, approximately
105% and 201%, respectively, of the consolidated inventories were accounted
for using the LIFO method of accounting.                    31             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In millions, except share and per share amounts
1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Continued
Property and Equipment -- Property and equipment are stated at cost, and
depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the
lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation and amortization
expense related to property and equipment was approximately $178, $139 and
$105 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the
useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon
retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or
loss is recognized in the statements of operations.
Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset carrying amount to
determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. The effect of any
impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such
asset and its carrying value.
Goodwill -- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair
value of identifiable assets of the businesses acquired using the purchase
method of accounting. Goodwill is stated at cost, net of accumulated
amortization, and is being amortized over a forty-year life using the
straight-line method. Goodwill amortization expense for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $80, $69, and $56, respectively. Management
continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that
indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of goodwill may warrant
revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. If an evaluation
is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
asset will be compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if such an
impairment exists. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses with
respect to goodwill or other long-lived assets to date.
Debt Issuance Costs-- The Company defers certain expenses incurred in
connection with its long-term debt and amortizes them over the term of the
respective agreements. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998, totaled $19, $13 and $09, respectively, and is included
in interest and securitization expense on the consolidated statements of
operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments -- The carrying values of cash,
accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value
of the long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates for the same or
similar debt offered to the Company having the same or similar remaining
maturities and collateral requirements. At December 31, 2000, the fair value of
the Company fixed rate long-term debt of $2300 was $1471. The carrying
amount of the Company variable rate long-term debt of $2630 approximates its
fair value.
Interest Rate Swap Agreements -- The Company has entered into interest
rate swap agreements to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such agreements involve the exchange of
amounts based on fixed interest rates for amounts based on variable interest
rates over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the notional amount
upon which payments are based. The differential to be paid or received as
interest rates change is accounted for on the accrual method of accounting.                    32             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Continued
The related amount payable or receivable from counterparties is included as an
adjustment to accrued interest in other accrued liabilities. In the event of
early extinguishment, any gain or loss would be recognized in income at the time
of extinguishment. At December 31, 2000, there were no interest rate swap
agreements outstanding.
Concentration of Credit Risk -- Financial instruments, which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
cash deposits, trade accounts and notes receivable. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts are within the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. Generally, credit is extended once
appropriate credit history and references have been obtained. Provisions to the
allowance for doubtful accounts are made monthly and adjustments are made
periodically as circumstances warrant based upon the expected collectibility
of all such accounts. Additionally, the Company periodically reviews the credit
history of its customers and generally does not require collateral for the
extension of credit.
Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for
the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
The provision for income taxes represents the amount of taxes payable and the
applicable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition -- The Company recognizes revenues as products are
shipped. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements, to provide guidance on the recognition, presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements. The SEC Staff issuance of SAB No.
101B on June 26, 2000 extended the compliance requirement until the fourth
quarter of fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999, with an effective
date of January 1, 2000. The Company has reviewed its revenue recognition
policies and believes that it is, and has been, in compliance with the
interpretive guidance set forth in SAB No. 101.
Earnings per Share -- The Company computes earnings per share in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS No.
128, Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128 requires presentation of basic earnings
per share Earnings per Share and diluted earnings per share Earnings per
Share -- Assuming Dilution. Earnings per Share excludes dilution and is
determined by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Earnings per
Share -- Assuming Dilution reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities and other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock.                    33             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

New Accounting Pronouncements -- In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133.
This standard requires entities to recognize all derivative instruments
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts as assets
or liabilities in its balance sheet and measure them at fair value. The
statement requires that changes in the derivatives' fair value be recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. SFAS
No. 133, as amended, is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2001. The
Company adopted these standards effective January 1, 2001 and there was no
impact as the Company was not a party to any derivative instruments at that
date. Subsequent to year-end, however, the Company entered into two interest
rate swap agreements in connection with the New Credit Facility and such
agreements will be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133.
2. Business Combinations
Pooling Transactions
During 1998, Metals USA completed the acquisition of all the capital stock
of Krohn Steel Service Center, Inc. Krohn in a business combination
accounted for as a pooling-of-interests transaction in accordance with the
requirements of APB No. 16. Krohn is a processor of flat rolled steel and is
headquartered in Springfield, Ohio.                    34             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Purchase Transactions
During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company acquired several
metal processing companies and businesses using the purchase method of
accounting. The aggregate consideration paid by Metals USA for the 1998
acquisitions was approximately $1983 in cash, 5,458,641 shares of common stock,
the issuance of notes of approximately $36 and the assumption of indebtedness
of approximately $901. During the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company
acquired several metal processing companies and businesses using the purchase
method of accounting. The aggregate consideration paid in connection with these
acquisitions was approximately $780 in cash, 317,283 shares of Common Stock,
convertible notes of approximately $40 and the assumption of indebtedness of
approximately $129. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company
acquired one metal processing business using the purchase method of
accounting. The aggregate consideration paid in connection with this acquisition
was $78 in cash and the assumption of $45 of liabilities.
The Company has recorded the excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of identifiable assets acquired in the transactions
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting as goodwill in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
The following summarized unaudited pro forma financial information adjusts
the historical financial information by assuming the acquisitions completed
during 1999 and 1998 and the issuance of the Notes as defined in Note 6
occurred on January 1, 1998. The pre-acquisition results of the 2000 acquisition
are immaterial, as it was completed during the first quarter of 2000;
consequently, pro forma results have not been presented for this acquisition.                             Years Ended December 31,

Pro forma adjustments included in the amounts above primarily relate to a the
reduction in certain related party lease expenses and management compensation,
which has been agreed to prospectively; b the amortization of goodwill
recorded over a forty-year estimated life, plus additional depreciation expense
due to the allocation of a portion of the excess purchase price to property and

Borrowings Under the Credit Facility
On March 12, 2001, the Company entered into two new financing agreements
with Bank of America and PNC Bank. Collectively, the agreements are referred to
as the New Credit Facility. The New Credit Facility is for a period of three
years, represents $4500 in financing, and replaced the former credit facility,
Former Credit Facility which consisted of a $3000 revolving credit facility
and a $1000 accounts receivable                    37            METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

securitization facility. The New Credit Facility is comprised of two loans, a
revolving credit facility providing up to $3500 in borrowings and a $1000 loan
to a wholly-owned and unrestricted subsidiary of the Company secured solely by
accounts receivable. The New Credit Facility will be secured by all of the
Company receivables not otherwise pledged under the accounts receivable
facility, inventories, and property and equipment. Borrowings under the New
Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of a borrowing base, comprised of
eligible receivables and inventories, or $4500 in the aggregate.
The New Credit Facility matures in March 2004, bears interest at the
bank prime rate or LIBOR, at Metals USA option, plus an applicable margin
based on a ratio of EBITDA as defined and adjusted to cash interest expense
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. A commitment fee is payable on any unused
portion of the New Credit Facility. The commitment fee varies between 1/2% and
1/4% per annum, based on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Company will use
the New Credit Facility to initially repay the borrowings under the Former
Credit Facility and thereafter to finance its working capital requirements, to
make capital expenditures, fund acquisitions including the refinancing of the
debt of the companies acquired and for general corporate purposes. Borrowings
under the New Credit Facility are guaranteed by each of the Company restricted
subsidiaries as defined under the Notes below.
The New Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various
customary affirmative, negative and subjective covenants, the most significant
of which are as follows: i the maintenance of certain financial ratios and
borrowing base availability, ii restrictions on additional indebtedness, iii
restrictions on liens, guarantees and quarterly dividends, iv obtaining the
lenders' consent with respect to certain individual acquisitions, and v
maintenance of a specified level of consolidated tangible net worth. The New
Credit Facility allows for the payment of up to $11 million of dividends in any
fiscal quarter provided that availability is greater than $450 million. At
March 14, 2001, the Company had $11 available for the payment of dividends.
Concurrent with executing the New Credit Facility, the Company entered
into two interest rate swap agreements designed as a partial hedge to the
Company variable rate borrowings under the New Credit Facility. The purpose of
these swap agreements is to fix interest rates on a portion of its borrowings
under the New Credit Facility, thereby reducing exposure to interest rate
fluctuations. At March 14, 2001, the Company had interest rate swap agreements
with a notional amount of $1000 compared to the total borrowings under the New
Credit Facility of $3279. Under these agreements, the Company will pay the
counterparties interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 548% and the
counterparties will pay the Company interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR.
The weighted average LIBOR rate applicable to these agreements was 515% at
March 14, 2001. The notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by the
parties, and thus are not a measure of exposure of the Company. The weighted
average variable rates are subject to change over time based on fluctuations in
the ninety-day LIBOR rate. The agreements expire on March 14, 2004.
Neither the Company nor the counterparties, which are prominent financial
institutions, are required to collateralize their respective obligations under
these agreements. The Company is exposed to loss if one or both of the
counterparties default. At March 14, 2001, the Company had no exposure to credit
loss on the interest rate swaps. The Company does not believe that any
reasonably likely change in interest rates would have a material adverse effect
on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
The Company entered into two swap agreements in connection with its Former
Credit Facility for an aggregate notional amount of $1250. These swaps expired
during the fourth quarter of 2000.                    38             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

In connection with the establishment of the New Credit Facility, the
Company expects to incur fees and expenses of about $6-$7 million, which will be
amortized over the three year term of the facility. Further, unamortized costs
associated with the Former Credit Facility in the amount of $26 million will be
written off during the first quarter of 2001.
Accounts Receivable Securitization Facility
As part of the Former Credit Facility, in January 1999, the Company
entered into a three-year agreement the Receivable Securitization Facility
to sell, on a revolving basis, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Metals
Receivables Corporation MRC, an undivided interest in a designated pool of
its trade accounts receivable to a commercial bank Purchaser. The maximum
undivided interest in MRC receivable portfolio that may be purchased pursuant
to this agreement is $1000. At December 31, 2000, the Company had received
$1000 from this facility. The Company, as agent for Purchaser, retained
collection and administrative responsibilities for the participating interests
sold. As collections reduced the receivables included in MRC receivable
portfolio, the Company could sell additional undivided interests in new
receivables to the Purchaser. The amount of the undivided interest in MRC
receivable portfolio sold changed monthly depending upon the level of defined
eligible receivables available for sale each month adjusted by certain defined
ratios. The unpurchased portion of the MRC receivable portfolio was a restricted
asset and effectively collateral for the benefit of the Purchaser. At December
31, 2000 and 1999, the unpurchased portion of the MRC receivable portfolio was
$483 and $372, respectively. Expense attributable to the Receivable
Securitization Facility for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, was $72
and $49, respectively, and is included in interest and securitization expense
on the consolidated statements of operations. The Receivable Securitization
Facility was terminated with the execution of the New Credit Facility.
8 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes
On February 11, 1998, the Company completed the sale of $2000 aggregate
principal amount of the Company 8 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 the
Notes. The Company received $1945 of net cash proceeds before expenses of
$08 at closing. The Company used $1793 of such proceeds to repay all the
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility which existed at that time.
The Notes call for semi-annual interest payments on February 15 and August
15 of each year, beginning August 15, 1998 and mature on February 15, 2008. The
Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after February 15, 2003, at the following redemption prices: 2003 104313%; 2004 -- 102875%; 2005 -- 101438%; thereafter -- 10000%, together
with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Notes are
guaranteed by substantially all of the Company current and future
subsidiaries. Additionally, the indenture governing the Notes contains customary
restrictions relating to additional indebtedness, liens, transactions with
affiliates, asset sales, investments, restricted payments and mergers and
acquisitions of subsidiaries. The Notes are subordinate to borrowings under the
New Credit Facility and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other
future subordinated debt of the Company and will rank senior to other
indebtedness that expressly provides that it is subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes.                    39             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

At December 31, 2000, exercisable options for shares of Common Stock were
2,140,001 at a weighted average price of $1148 per share.
The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated fair
value of stock options and similar awards. The model requires the use of a
number of subjective assumptions including: i risk free rate of return, ii
expected price volatility of the Common Stock, iii expected dividend yield and
iv estimated life of the option. Principal assumptions used in estimating the
fair value of the Company stock options using the Black-Scholes model were

for its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option
plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date, consistent
with the methodology prescribed under the SFAS No. 123, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced by the amortization of the
estimated fair value of stock options over the applicable vesting period of such
awards. The following pro forma disclosures may not be                    43             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

certain employment contracts, $21 for severance costs attributable to the
consolidation of administrative and support functions, and $40 for the costs of
combining five processing facilities into others within the same geographic
region. These changes affected less than 5% of the Company workforce. The
following schedule sets forth by segment the Integration Charge recorded in the
third quarter of 1999 and costs paid through December 31, 2000.                          Integration    Costs
Charge      Paid
Plates and Shapes..      $ 56     $ 35
Flat Rolled..        11       8
Building Products..        27       7
Total..      $ 94     $ 50
The Company expects to pay between approximately $05 and $15 during each
of the next four quarterly reporting periods with respect to the remaining costs
and to complete the initial plan for the integration and consolidation of
certain operations and administrative functions by December 31, 2001. Although
the foregoing estimates with respect to both costs and timing reflect the best
information available to management, there can be no assurance that such costs
will not exceed current expectations or that the timing of the facility
integration activities will not be delayed. In aggregate, adjustments for
estimates for costs incurred through December 31, 2000 were less than $01.
Approximately $10 of the costs included in costs paid result from negotiated
settlements with respect to certain employment contracts that are to be paid
over a three to five year period. These amounts were reclassified from the
Integration Charge to other accrued liabilities at December 31, 1999.                    44             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

11. Segment and Related Information
During 1998, the Company organized into four product groups: Plates and
Shapes, Flat Rolled, Specialty Metals and Building Products. In early 2001, the
Company announced a change in the organization to reduce the number of product
groups to three. The Flat Rolled Group will expand to include all flat rolled
processing operations of specialty metals and carbon steel in a single business
unit. Similarly, the non-flat rolled operations of the former Specialty Metals
Group will be included in an expanded Plates and Shapes Group. Each segment
processes and distributes distinct products for different customer bases and is
managed by a product segment team focused on improving and expanding segment
operations. The following descriptions reflect the reorganization of the product
groups. -   Plates and Shapes consists of fifty-two facilities that maintain an
inventory focusing on carbon products such as structural plate, beams,
bars and tubing as well as many specialty metals products including
stainless steel, ductile iron, brass, copper, aluminum, magnesium and
titanium. This segment provides processing services to their customers,
such as cutting, cambering/leveling, punching, bending, shearing,
cut-to-length and T-splitting. -   Flat Rolled consists of twenty-nine facilities that maintain an inventory
of cold rolled and hot rolled steel products and various nonferrous flat
rolled products including aluminum, stainless steel, copper and brass.
This segment provides processing services for their customers such as
slitting, precision blanking, leveling, cut-to-length, laser cutting,
punching, bending and shearing. -   Building Products consists of sixty-three facilities that produce and
distribute aluminum and steel building products consisting of covered
canopies and walkways, awnings, sunrooms, solariums and other products
primarily for the commercial and residential building products industries.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company
evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income.                    45             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

12. Employee Benefit Plans
Profit-Sharing Plans
The Company established the Metals USA, Inc. 401k Plan on June 1, 1998
to provide a standardized defined contributions savings plan the Plan for
employees. Participants are eligible for the Plan after completing six full
calendar months of service. Participants' employer contributions vest at varying
rates, ranging from full vesting upon participation to vesting that begins after
one year of service and are fully vested after four years. The Company
contributions consist of a matching contribution of 50%, up to 6% of the
eligible employee contribution. The Plan allows the employee to contribute up
to 15% of their eligible compensation.
The Company established the Metals USA, Inc. Union 401k Plan on October
1, 1998 to provide a standard defined contributions savings plan for all
employees covered under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement the
Union Plan. The employer is not obligated by the Union Plan to make
contributions, unless required by the operative collective bargaining agreement.
These contributions will generally vest from four to seven years, as specified
by the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. The Union Plan
allows the employee to contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation.
Certain subsidiaries provided various defined contributions plans for
their employees prior to being acquired by Metals USA, Inc. Contributions for
the profit-sharing portion of these plans, prior to the inception of the Plan
and the Union Plan, were at the discretion of the individual subsidiaries' board
of directors. The benefit plans of acquired companies are merged into the Plan
as soon as practicable.
The aggregate contributions to the Plans were $39, $34, and $28 for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Leveraged ESOP Arrangement
Under the provisions of an employee stock ownership plan ESOP and its
related trust, Jeffreys Steel Company, Inc. Jeffreys, a 1997 acquisition
accounted for as a pooling transaction, made annual contributions to the ESOP
which were invested in stock of Jeffreys and other qualifying securities for the
benefit of Jeffreys' employees. The ESOP provided for Jeffreys' purchases of
employee shares to be paid in cash and with the issuance of a note payable.
Effective September 26, 1997, the participation was frozen. Concurrent with the
merger with Metals USA, ESOP shares were exchanged for shares of Metals USA
common stock. The following reflects the equivalent shares of Metals USA common
stock that were issued in connection with the acquisition of Jeffreys.
Jeffreys' ESOP held 434,616 shares of stock prior to the purchase of
735,384 shares of outstanding stock from a majority stockholder for $531 per
share. The ESOP borrowed the funds to purchase such stock and Jeffreys
guaranteed the repayment of this loan. Jeffreys repaid this loan, plus interest,
through deductible contributions to the plan. As Jeffreys made contributions to
the plan, which reduced the principal on the note, the plan released the
corresponding shares related to the reduction in the note principal. At the
point when these shares were no longer specifically secured by the note payable,
they were allocated to the individual participants of the plan and considered
earned by those employees at that time. Jeffreys accounted for its ESOP in
accordance with Statement of Position 93-6 SOP 93-6, Employers' Accounting
for Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP was
recorded as long-term debt and the shares pledged                    47             METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

as collateral were reported as unearned compensation. As shares were released
from collateral, Jeffreys reported compensation expense equal to estimated
market price of the shares at that time. ESOP share compensation expense was
$26 for the year ended December 31, 1998. Since the obligation was secured by
the shares purchased and the note was guaranteed by Jeffreys, all amounts
relating to this transaction were considered unearned compensation of the
employees until such time as the note was repaid and the corresponding shares
were released to the individual participants of the plan. With the termination
of the ESOP in August 1998, subsequent to the payment of the note to Jeffreys
and the distribution of the ESOP shares to the individual participants, all
unearned compensation was charged to expense in 1998.
In accordance with SOP 93-6, additional paid-in capital was adjusted
whenever the market value of the shares released was more or less than the cost
of the shares released. The increase in additional paid-in capital attributable
to this difference in market value and cost was $21 for the year ended December
31, 1998.
