Each
director holds office until the next annual election of directors and until his successor is chosen and qualified or until he sooner dies, resigns, is removed, or becomes
disqualified. Each officer generally holds office until the first meeting of the directors after the next annual election of directors and until his successor is chosen and qualified or until he
sooner dies, resigns, is removed, or becomes disqualified. Compliance With Section16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
Section16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of its common
stock, to file reports of ownership and 
30  changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater-than-10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company
with copies of all Section16a forms they file. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5, and amendments thereto furnished to the Company with respect to fiscal year 2001, or written
representations that no Form5 was required to be filed with respect to fiscal year 2001, PRI believes that all of its officers, directors and greater-than-10%
stockholders fulfilled their Section16a filing requirements in a timely manner, with the exception of Mr.Wiesler, who inadvertently failed to file on a timely basis a report on
Form4 with respect to one transaction.
