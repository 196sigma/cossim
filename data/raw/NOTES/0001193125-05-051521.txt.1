33 Index to Financial Statements
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended
December 31, 2004 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting.  Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule
13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as
of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  The scope of our managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting includes all of our businesses except for HSS, a material business acquired on November 10, 2004. HSS
revenues were $113 million and HSS assets were $536 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. We plan to fully integrate HSS into our systems and internal controls in 2005. As of December 31, 2004, this system integration process had not
begun.  KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
an audit report on managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of KPMG LLP is contained in Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
