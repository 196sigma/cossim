REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS  To the Stockholders of Coldwater Creek Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Coldwater Creek Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of March 2, 2002 and March 3,
2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended March 2, 2002, March 3, 2001 and February 26, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Coldwater Creek Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 2, 2002 and March 3, 2001, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended March 2, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  S/

COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.NATURE OF BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE  Coldwater Creek Inc., together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries the Company, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Sandpoint, Idaho, is a triple-sales channel,
two-operating segment retailer of womens apparel, jewelry, footwear, gift items and home merchandise. The Companys Direct Segment encompasses its traditional catalog business and Internet-based, e-commerce business, as well as its
merchandise clearance outlet stores, whereas its Retail Segment encompasses its expanding base of full-line retail stores throughout the United States U.S.  The Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Coldwater Creek Outlet Stores, Inc. encompasses the Companys merchandise clearance outlet stores.  2.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Principals of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Fiscal Periods  References to a fiscal year refer to the calendar year in which such fiscal year commences. The Companys fiscal year ends on the Saturday immediately
preceding or following February 28th, whichever is chronologically closer. This floating fiscal year-end typically results in a fifty-two week fiscal year but will occasionally give rise to an additional week resulting in a fifty-three week fiscal
year. The Companys most recently completed fiscal year ended March 2, 2002 fiscal 2001 consisted of fifty-two 52 weeks whereas its preceding fiscal years ended March 3, 2001 fiscal 2000 and February 26, 2000
fiscal 1999 consisted of fifty-three 53 and fifty-two 52 weeks, respectively.  Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses, the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These
estimates and assumptions are based on the Companys historical results as well as managements future expectations. The Companys actual results could vary from its estimates and assumptions.  Reclassifications  Certain amounts in the
consolidated financial statements for the prior fiscal years have been reclassified to be consistent with the current fiscal years presentation.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company elected to reclassify its deferred catalog costs as a current asset in light of their historically short economic life and the prevailing industry accounting practice. The
Company reclassified all prior period financial statements on a consistent basis. These reclassifications had no impact on net income, retained earnings or cash flows for any reported period. 
52 Table of Contents
COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes sales including shipping and handling income and the related cost of sales either at the time merchandise ordered from a catalog or web site is shipped to the customer or at
the time a sale is consummated with a customer in a store. The Company maintains an allowance for sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations. Collections for unshipped orders are reflected as a component of accounts payable
and are immaterial in amount. List rental income is netted against selling, general and administrative SGA expenses.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity date of three months
or less at the date of purchase.  Inventories  Inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are stated at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market.  
Prepaid and Deferred Catalog Costs  Catalog costs include all direct
costs associated with the development, production and circulation of direct mail catalogs and are accumulated as prepaid catalog costs until such time as the related catalog is mailed. Once mailed, these costs are reclassified as deferred catalog
costs and are amortized into SGA expenses over the expected sales realization cycle, typically several weeks. The Companys consolidated SGA expenses include amortized catalog costs of $974 million, $1046million and $819
million for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment, including any major additions and improvements thereto, are recorded at cost. Minor additions and improvements, as well as maintenance and repairs, that do not
materially extend the useful life of property or equipment are charged to operations as incurred. The net book value of property or equipment sold or retired is removed from the asset and related accumulated depreciation accounts with any resulting
net gain or loss included in results of operations.  Depreciation and amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method. The
estimated useful lives for buildings and land improvements are fifteen to thirty years. The estimated useful lives for furniture and fixtures, technology hardware and software and machinery and equipment are three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the contractual lives of the underlying operating leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, currently three to twenty years, whichever is less. 
Deferred Rents  Certain of the Companys operating leases contain
predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rentals during the original term of the lease. For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease and records the difference
53 Table of Contents
COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
between the amounts charged to operations and amounts paid as deferred rent. Any lease incentives received by the Company are deferred and subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis over the
life of the lease as a reduction of rent expense.  Deferred Income Taxes  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax benefits or consequences, based on enacted laws, of temporary differences between tax and financial
statement reporting. Deferred tax assets are then reduced, if deemed necessary, by a valuation allowance for the amount of any tax benefits that, more likely than not based on current circumstances, are not expected to be
realized.  Cost of Sales and SGA Expenses
The Companys consolidated cost of sales primarily consists of merchandise acquisition costs, including related buying and
freight-in costs, as well as warehousing and distribution costs, shipping and handling costs, returned merchandise processing costs, and retail and outlet store occupancy costs. The Companys consolidated SGA expenses primarily consist of
selling expenses, marketing expenses, including amortization of deferred catalog costs, and general and administrative expenses. The Companys consolidated SGA expenses include advertising costs of $55 million, $26 million and $22
million for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Store Pre-Opening Costs  The Company incurs certain preparation and training costs prior to the opening of a retail store. These pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred and are
included in SGA expenses. Pre-opening costs were $2,850,000, $980,000 and $278,000 during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Net Income Per Share  Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing income applicable to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur under the Treasury Stock Method if potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options, were
exercised or converted to common stock. Should the Company incur a net loss, potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as they would be antidilutive.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Companys financial instruments
primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables and loans to executives for which the carrying amounts materially approximate their fair values.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  In June 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS No. 141. SFAS No. 141 mandates the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations
initiated after June 30, 2001. In
54 Table of Contents
COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
addition, SFAS No. 141 addresses the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill acquired in business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. The magnitude to which SFAS No. 141 will impact
the future financial statements of the Company will depend upon the particulars of any future business combinations.  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142, which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and other
intangible assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be systematically amortized into operating results. Instead, each of these assets will be tested for impairment, in the absence of an
indicator of possible impairment, at least annually, and upon an indicator of possible impairment, immediately. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 effective March 3, 2002 for its fiscal 2002 consolidated financial statements with no material impact.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No.
144, which modifies and expands the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets other than goodwill, which is specifically addressed by SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 144 maintains the requirement that an
impairment loss be recognized for a long-lived asset to be held and used if its carrying value is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, with the recognized impairment being the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the
asset. With respect to long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale, SFAS No. 144 requires that the asset be considered held and used until it is actually disposed of but requires that its depreciable life be revised in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes. SFAS No. 144 also requires that an impairment loss be recognized at the date a long-lived asset is exchanged for a similar productive asset or distributed to its owners in a spin-off if the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. With respect to long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, SFAS No. 144 requires that the asset classified as held for sale be measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less selling
costs, with no further depreciation or amortization. As such, discontinued operations are no longer measured on a net realizable value basis, and future operating losses are no longer recognized before they occur. SFAS No. 144 also broadens the
previously existing income statement presentation requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of a business, that being the operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting
purposes, from the rest of the entity. A component of an entity that is classified as held for sale or that has been disposed of is presented as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be
eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component. The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 effective March 3, 2002 for its fiscal 2002 consolidated
financial statements with no material impact.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS No. 143, which sets forth the financial
accounting and reporting to be followed for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Subsequently, the
recorded liability will be accreted to its present value and the capitalized costs will
55 Table of Contents
COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
be depreciated. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 143, as required, in its consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Management is continuing to assess the provisions
of SFAS No. 143 and the likely impact of its adoption on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  3.RECEIVABLES

credit and a term standby letter of credit of $16 million. At the option of the Company, the interest rate under the agreement is either i the lead banks Prime Rate or ii adjusted LIBOR [i.e., the London Interbank Offered Rate divided by

Anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the above computations were 320, 214 and 279 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.   101996 STOCK OPTION/STOCK ISSUANCE PLAN  The
Companys 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1996 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by a majority of stockholders on March 4, 1996. On July 14, 2001, a majority of stockholders approved an additional
300,000 share allotment thereby increasing the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the 1996 Plan to 1,861,847 common shares. The 1996 Plan will terminate on March 3, 2006, unless sooner terminated by the Board of Directors.
The 1996 Plan is divided into three separate components: i the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which eligible individuals,
including officers and key employees, non-employee directors and consultants, and other independent advisors, may, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise
price not less than 85% of the then fair market value of the Companys common stock for non-statutory options and 100% of the then fair market value of the Companys common stock for incentive options, ii the Stock Issuance Program under
which such individuals may, at the Plan Administrators
59 Table of Contents
COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
discretion, be directly sold or issued, as a bonus tied to the performance of services and/or achievement of performance goals, shares of the Companys common stock at a price not less than
100% of the then fair market value and iii the Automatic Option Grant Program under which option grants will automatically be made at periodic intervals to eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock at an exercise price equal to 100% of the then fair market value on the date of grant.  Under the
Discretionary Option Grant Program component of the 1996 Plan, employees have been granted options which remain outstanding at March 2, 2002 to purchase 836,190 shares of the Companys common stock. Under the Automatic Option Grant Program
component of the 1996 Plan, non-employee members of the Board of Directors have been granted options which remain outstanding at March 2, 2002 to purchase 94,421 shares of the Companys common stock. Options granted under the Discretionary
Option Grant Program to employees vest and become exercisable on a pro rata basis over either four or five years, as specified. The initial and subsequent annual allotments of options granted under the Automatic Option Grant Program to non-employee
members of the Board of Directors are immediately exercisable and vest on a pro rata basis over three years and one year, respectively. The options expire ten years from date of issue under the Discretionary Option Grant Program, subject to earlier
expiration for vested options not exercised following termination of employment, and have a maximum term of ten years under the Automatic Option Grant Program, subject to earlier expiration for vested options not exercised two years following the
optionees cessation of Board service.  A summary of the status of the Companys stock options as of March 2, 2002, March
3, 2001 and February 26, 2000 and the changes during the fiscal years then ended, is presented below:

As allowed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company has retained the compensation measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB No. 25, and its related interpretations, for stock options.
Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized based upon the difference, if any, at the measurement date between the market value of the stock and the option exercise price. The measurement date is the date at which both the number of options
and the exercise price for each option are known.  Had compensation expense for the 1996 Plan been determined using the compensation
measurement principles of SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income and related net income per basic and diluted share amounts would have been reduced by the following amounts:

The above effects of applying SFAS No. 123 are not indicative of future amounts. Additional
awards in future years are anticipated. In calculating the preceding, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:

11.EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
The Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by a majority of stockholders on January 28, 1996. Under the ESPP,
eligible employees may purchase shares of the Companys common stock at six-month intervals at the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on i the respective employees enrollment date or ii the last day of each six-month purchase
interval. The maximum number of shares that an employee may purchase on any one purchase date may not exceed 1,000 shares. The Companys employees purchased 16,000shares during fiscal 2001 and 13,000 shares during both fiscal 2000 and
fiscal 1999. The average share price for these purchases was $1477, $1195 and $1026 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  12.RETIREMENT PLAN AND INCENTIVE BASED COMPENSATION  Effective October 1, 1988, and as amended
from time to time, the Company adopted a tax-qualified employee savings, retirement and profit sharing plan qualified under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the 401k Plan under which eligible employees may
elect to defer a portion of their current compensation, up to certain statutorily prescribed annual limits, and make corresponding periodic contributions into the 401k Plan. Contributions to the 401k Plan, as well as any income earned thereon,
are not taxable to the employee until withdrawn from the 401k Plan. All employees twenty-one years of age and older with 1,000 hours of service who have been employed by the Company for at least one year are eligible to participate in the 401k
Plan. The Company matches a certain percentage of the employees overall contribution and may make a discretionary profit sharing contribution based on the overall profitability of the Company. The Company recognized contribution expense of
$431,000, $885,000 and $693,000 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Effective June 30, 1997, the Company established an
Executive Loan Program under which the Company may make, at its sole discretion and with prior approvals from the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors Compensation Committee, secured long-term loans to key executives other than
Dennis and Ann Pence. Each loan is secured by the executives personal net assets, inclusive of all vested stock options in the Company, bears interest at three percent per annum, and becomes due and payable on the earlier of i the date ten
days before the date on which the vested stock options serving as partial security expire or ii ninety days from the date on which the executives employment with the Company terminates for any reason. Outstanding loans were $08 million and
$12 million at March 2, 2002 and March 3, 2001, respectively.  During fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001, compensation bonus pools in the amounts
of $1,650,000, $250,000 and $75,000, respectively, were authorized as additional incentives to retain certain designated key employees. The Company is accruing the related compensation expense to each designated key employee on a straight-line basis
over a twenty-four month period based on specified performance criteria. The Company reduced the $1,650,000 compensation bonus pool by $200,000 in
62 Table of Contents
COLDWATER CREEK INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
fiscal 2001 in connection with departed employees. On September 25, 2001, the remaining $1,450,000 of the initial $1,650,000 compensation bonus pool was considered earned and subsequently paid in
full. On March 25, 2002, $200,000 of the $250,000 compensation bonus pool was considered earned and subsequently paid in full. The balances in the remaining pools will be payable provided certain performance criteria is met over the preceding
24-month period.  13.COMMITMENTS  The Company leases its East Coast operations center, Coeur dAlene, Idaho call center, retail and outlet store space as well as certain other property and equipment under operating leases. Certain leases require percentage
rentals on sales above specified minimums, contain escalation clauses and renewal options, and are noncancellable with aggregate minimum lease payment requirements. The Company incurred rent expense under its operating leases of $9,793,000 6,986,000 and $4,709,000 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company incurred $44,000, $237,000 and $25,000 of contingent rental expense in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As of March 2, 2002, the Companys minimum
lease payment requirements are as follows: $14,376,000 in fiscal 2002, $14,822,000 in fiscal 2003, $14,691,000 in fiscal 2004, $14,127,000 in fiscal 2005 and $13,996,000 in fiscal 2006, with total payments thereafter of $83,591,000. Subsequent to
March 2, 2002, the Company entered into additional retail store leases with minimum lease payment requirements as follows: $485,000 in fiscal 2002, $702,000 in fiscal 2003, $702,000 in fiscal 2004, $702,000 in fiscal 2005 and $702,000 in fiscal
2006, with total payments thereafter of $2,733,000. These minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense which may be paid under certain leases based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. Additionally, the
Company had inventory purchase commitments of approximately $52,000,000 and $62,000,000 at March 2, 2002 and March 3, 2001, respectively.  14.CONTINGENCIES  The Company is periodically involved in litigation and administrative
proceedings primarily arising in the normal course of its business. In the opinion of management, the Companys gross liability, if any, and without any consideration given to the availability of insurance or other indemnification, under any
pending litigation or administrative proceedings would not materially affect its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company and its Coldwater Creek Outlet Stores Inc. subsidiary collect sales taxes from customers transacting purchases in states in which the Company or this subsidiary have physically based some portion of their retailing business. The
Company and this subsidiary also pay applicable corporate income, franchise and other taxes to states in which retail or outlet stores are physically located. Various states have attempted to collect back sales and use taxes from direct marketers
whose only contacts with the taxing state are solicitations through the mail or the Internet, and whose subsequent delivery of purchased goods is by mail or interstate common carriers. The United States Supreme Court has held that these states,
absent congressional legislation, may not impose tax collection obligations on an out-of-state mail order or Internet company. The Company anticipates that any legislative changes regarding direct marketers, if adopted, would be applied only on a
prospective basis.

15.SEGMENT REPORTING  The Companys executive management, being its chief operating decision makers, work together to allocate resources to and assess the performance of the Companys business. During the
Companys fiscal 2001 fourth quarter, with the most recent phase of its retail store expansion in place and certain new enabling management information systems operational, the Companys executive management no longer viewed and managed
the Company collectively but instead as two distinct operating segments, Direct and Retail. The Direct operating segment encompasses the Companys traditional catalog business, Internet-based e-commerce business and merchandise clearance outlet
stores whereas the Retail operating segment encompasses the Companys expanding base of full-line retail stores. Although continuing to offer customers substantially similar merchandise, the Companys Direct and Retail operating segments
now have distinct management, marketing, operating and inventory management strategies and processes.  The Companys executive management assesses the performance of each operating segment based on an operating contribution measure, being net sales less merchandise acquisition
costs and certain directly identifiable and allocable operating costs, as described below. For the Direct operating segment, these operating costs primarily consist of catalog development, production, and circulation costs, e-commerce advertising
costs and order processing costs. For the Retail operating segment, these operating costs primarily consist of store selling and occupancy costs. Operating contribution less corporate and other expenses is equal to income before interest and taxes.
Corporate and other expenses consist of unallocated shared-service costs and general and administrative expenses. Unallocated shared-service costs include receiving, distribution and storage costs, merchandising and quality assurance costs as well
as corporate occupancy costs. General and administrative expenses include costs associated with general corporate management and shared departmental services e.g., finance, accounting, data processing and human resources.  Operating segment assets are those directly used in or clearly allocable to an operating segments operations. For the Direct operating segment, these assets
primarily include inventory and prepaid and deferred catalog costs. For the Retail operating segment, these assets primarily include inventory, fixtures and leasehold improvements. Corporate and other assets include corporate headquarters,
merchandise distribution, and shared technology infrastructure as well as corporate cash and cash equivalents and prepaid expenses. Operating segment depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are correspondingly allocated to each
operating segment. Corporate and other depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures are related to corporate headquarters, merchandise distribution and technology infrastructure.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, management decided to eliminate the Companys stand-alone Home catalog. Net sales for the Home catalog were $170 million, $152 million
and $129million for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  3
Due to information systems limitations, the Company does not have the ability to break out the capital expenditure and total asset information by segment for the fiscal years ended March

The Companys products are principally marketed to individuals within the United States.
Net sales realized from other geographic markets, primarily Canada and Japan, have collectively been less than 5% of consolidated net sales in each reported period. No single customer accounts for ten percent or more of consolidated net sales.
Apparel sales have constituted approximately three quarters of the Companys consolidated net sales during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, with sales of jewelry, footwear, gift items and home merchandise constituting the respective balances.
