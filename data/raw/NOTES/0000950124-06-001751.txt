NOTE1
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Business:
Borders Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, Borders, Inc.
Borders, Walden Book Company, Inc.
Waldenbooks, Borders UKLimited, Borders
Australia Pty Limited and others individually and collectively,
the Company, is the second largest operator of
book, music and movie superstores and the largest operator of
mall-based bookstores in the world based upon both sales and
number of stores. At January28, 2006, the Company operated
528superstores under the Borders name, including 473 in
the UnitedStates, 35 in the United Kingdom, 14 in
Australia, three in Puerto Rico, two in New Zealand and one in
Singapore. The Company also operated 678mall-based and
other bookstores primarily under the Waldenbooks name in the
United States and 33bookstores under the Books etc. name
in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Company owns and
operates United Kingdom-based Paperchase Products Limited
Paperchase, a designer and retailer of stationery,
cards and gifts. As of January 28, 2006, Paperchase operated
90stores, primarily in the United Kingdom, and Paperchase
shops have been added to nearly 100domestic Borders
Superstores. Principles of
Consolidation: The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Use of Estimates: The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year: On
December10, 2004, the Board of Directors of the Company
approved a change in the Companys fiscal year-end.
Effective with respect to fiscal 2005, the Company elected to
change its fiscal year to a
52/53-week fiscal year
ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. The
Company implemented this change in order to conform to industry
standards and for certain administrative purposes. As a result
of the change, the Companys 2005 fiscal year consisted of
53weeks, and ended on January28, 2006. The
Companys fiscal years had previously ended on the Sunday
immediately preceding the last Wednesday in January. Fiscal 2004
consisted of 52weeks and ended January23, 2005.
Fiscal 2003 consisted of 52weeks and ended
January25, 2004. References herein to years are to the
Companys fiscal years. Foreign Currency and Translation of Foreign
Subsidiaries: The functional
currencies of the Companys foreign operations are the
respective local currencies. All assets and liabilities of the
Companys foreign operations are translated into
U.S.dollars at fiscal period-end exchange rates. Income
and expense items are translated at average exchange rates
prevailing during the year. The resulting translation
adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders
equity and comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction
gains/losses were$21, $02, and $04 in 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively. Cash and Equivalents:
Cash and equivalents include short-term investments with
original maturities of 90days or less. Investments: Investments
include primarily short-term investments in auction rate
securities. Inventories: Merchandise
inventories are valued on a first-in, first-out
FIFO basis at the lower of cost or market using
the retail inventory method. The Company includes certain
distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs, totaling
$1021 and $914 as of January28, 2006, and
January23, 2005, respectively. Property and Equipment:
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, including
capitalized interest, and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives on a straight-line basis for financial statement
purposes and 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data on accelerated methods for income tax purposes. Most store
properties are leased and improvements are amortized over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial term of
the related lease, generally over three to 20years. Other
annual rates used in computing depreciation for financial
statement purposes approximate 3% for buildings and 10% to 33%
for other fixtures and equipment. Amortization of assets under
capital leases is included in depreciation expense. The carrying values of long-lived assets are evaluated whenever
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of such
assets may not be recoverable, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. In
performing such reviews for recoverability, the Company compares
the expected cash flows to the carrying values of long-lived
assets. If the expected future cash flows are less than the
carrying amounts of such assets, the Company recognizes an
impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount
and its estimated fair value. Fair value is estimated using
expected discounted future cash flows. Goodwill: Pursuant to the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
FAS142, the Companys goodwill is
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment
indicators arise. Pursuant to FAS142, a reporting unit is
defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating
segment a component, for which discrete financial information
is available and reviewed by management. The Companys
reporting units were identified as the operating segments of
Domestic Borders superstores, Waldenbooks Specialty Retail and
Corporate, and the country components of the International
operating segment. The carrying amounts of the net assets of the
applicable reporting units including goodwill are compared to
the estimated fair values of those reporting units. Fair value
is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends
on, among other factors, estimates of future sales and expense
trends, liquidity and capitalization. The discount rate used
approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a
hypothetical third party buyer. Leases: All leases are
reviewed for capital or operating classification at their
inception under the guidance of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No13, Accounting for
Leases FAS13, as amended. The Company
uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease
classification, and defines initial lease term to include the
construction build-out period, but to exclude lease extension
periods. The Company conducts operations primarily under
operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalations, the
Company records the total rent payable during the lease term, as
defined above, on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease and records the difference between the rents paid and the
straight-line rent as a deferred rent liability, under
Other long-term liabilities on the Companys
consolidated balance sheets, totaling $1547 and $1449 as of
January28, 2006 and January23, 2005, respectively. Landlord Allowances: The
Company classifies landlord allowances as deferred rent
liabilities, under Other long-term liabilities on
the Companys consolidated balance sheets, totaling $1320
and $1163 as of January28, 2006 and January23,
2005, respectively, in accordance with the provisions of FASB
Technical
BulletinNo88-1,
Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases FTB
88-1, and as an
operating activity on the Companys consolidated statements
of cash flows. Also in accordance with the provisions of FTB
88-1, the Company
classifies the amortization of landlord allowances as a
reduction of occupancy expense, included as a component of
Cost of merchandise sold includes occupancy in the
Companys consolidated statements of operations. Financial Instruments:
The recorded values of the Companys financial instruments,
which include accounts receivable, accounts payable and
indebtedness, approximate their fair values. Pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No133, Accounting For Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities
FAS133, as amended, the Company recognizes
the fair value of its derivatives on the consolidated balance
sheets. Changes in derivative fair values are either 50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value
of related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments, or,
for forecasted transactions, deferred and recorded as a
component of other stockholders equity until the hedged
transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. The
ineffective portion of a hedging derivatives change in
fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
Loss: Accumulated other
comprehensive income lossfor the Company includes fair
value changes of derivatives net of tax and exchange rate
fluctuations. Disclosure of comprehensive income lossis
incorporated into the consolidated statements of
stockholders equity for all years presented. Accumulated
other comprehensive income lossincludes $00 and $01
for derivatives and $194 and $252 for exchange rate
fluctuations as of January28, 2006 and January23,
2005, respectively. Revenue: Revenue is
recognized, net of estimated returns, at the point of sale for
all of the Companys segments. Revenue excludes sales taxes
and any value-added taxes. The Company, through its subsidiaries, has agreements with
Amazon.com, Inc. Amazon to operate Web sites
utilizing the Borders.com, Waldenbooks.com, Borders.co.uk and
Booksetc.co.uk URLs the Web Sites. Under these
agreements, Amazon is the merchant of record for all sales made
through the Web Sites, and determines all prices and other terms
and conditions applicable to such sales. Amazon is responsible
for the fulfillment of all products sold through the Web Sites
and retains all payments from customers. The Company receives
referral fees for products purchased through the Web Sites, and
includes this income as a component of Other revenue
in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The
agreements contain mutual indemnification provisions, including
provisions that define between the parties the responsibilities
with respect to any liabilities for sales, use and similar
taxes, including penalties and interest, associated with
products sold on the Web Sites. Currently, taxes are not
collected with respect to products sold on the Web Sites except
in certain states. In addition, Borders has an agreement with Amazon to allow
customers ordering certain book, music and movie products
through certain of Amazons Web sites to purchase and pick
up the merchandise at Borders stores in the United States
Express In-Store Pick Up. Under this agreement,
the Company is the merchant of record for all sales made through
this service, and determines all prices and other terms and
conditions applicable to such sales. The Company fulfills all
products sold through Express In-Store Pick Up. In addition, the
Company assumes all risk, cost and responsibility related to the
sale and fulfillment of all products sold. The Company
recognizes revenue upon customers pick up of the
merchandise at the store, and classifies this revenue as a
component of Sales in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations. The Company also pays
referral fees to Amazon pursuant to this agreement. Pre-Opening Costs: The
Company expenses pre-opening costs as incurred in accordance
with SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up
Activities. Closing Costs: Pursuant
to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities FAS 146, the Company
expenses when incurred all amounts related to the discontinuance
of operations of stores identified for closure. Preferred Reader Program:
Until October 2004, Waldenbooks sold memberships in its
Preferred Reader Program, which offered members discounts on
purchases and other benefits. The Company recognized membership
income on a straight-line basis over the 12-month term of the
membership, and categorized the income as Other
revenue in the Companys consolidated statements of
operations. Discounts on purchases were netted against
Sales in the Companys consolidated statements
of operations. Gift Cards: The Company
sells gift cards to its customers and records a liability for
the face value of all certificates issued and unredeemed within
the last 12months. For certificates older than
12months, the Company records a liability for a portion of
the certificates face value based upon historical
redemption 51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data trends, and records the related income as a component of
Other revenue in the Companys consolidated
statements of operations. The Company has included the liability
for gift cards as a component of Accrued payroll and other
liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets, totaling
$1454 and $1405 as of January28, 2006 and
January23, 2005, respectively. Advertising Costs: The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, and recorded
approximately $394, $447 and $359 of gross advertising
expenses in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company receives payments and credits from vendors pursuant
to co-operative advertising programs, shared markdown programs,
purchase volume incentive programs and magazine slotting
programs. Pursuant to co-operative advertising programs offered by
vendors, the Company contracts with vendors to promote
merchandise for specified time periods. Pursuant to the
provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No02-16,
Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for
Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor EITF
02-16, which the Company adopted effective
January1, 2003, vendor consideration which represents a
reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs is
included in the Selling, general and administrative
line on the consolidated statements of operations, along with
the related costs, in the period the promotion takes place.
Consideration which exceeds such costs is classified as a
reduction of the Cost of merchandise sold line on
the consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the
Company recorded $11 and $08 of vendor consideration as a
reduction to its inventory balance at January28, 2006 and
January23, 2005, respectively. The Company also receives credits from vendors pursuant to
shared markdown programs, purchase volume programs, and magazine
slotting programs. Credits received pursuant to these programs
are classified in the Cost of merchandise sold line
on the consolidated statements of operations, and are recognized
upon certain product volume thresholds being met or product
placements occurring. Advertising costs not part of the programs listed above are
included in the Selling, general and administrative
line of the consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes: Income
taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes FAS 109. FAS 109 requires
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets
and liabilities. FAS 109 also requires that deferred tax assets
be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than
not that some portion of or all of the deferred tax asset will
not be realized. The Company and its subsidiaries file separate foreign, state
and local income tax returns and, accordingly, provide for such
income taxes on a separate company basis. Equity-Based
Compensation: The Company
accounts for equity-based compensation under the guidance of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
No25. As permitted, the Company has adopted the
disclosure-only option of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation FAS123, as amended by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure. The following table illustrates

See Note15 Stock-Based Benefit
Plans for further discussion of the Companys
equity-based compensation plans. New Accounting Guidance:
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment FAS123R, which is a revision
of FAS123. FAS123R supersedes APB No25, and
amends FAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, the approach in FAS123R is similar to the
approach described in FAS123. However, FAS123R
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants
of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values. The Company will adopt
FAS123R in the first quarter of 2006 using the
modified-prospective method in which compensation cost is
recognized beginning with the adoption date based on
athe requirements of FAS123R for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and bbased on
the requirements of Statement123 for all awards granted to
employees prior to the effective date of Statement123R
that remain unvested on the effective date. As of
January28, 2006, there were 06million stock option
awards granted to employees that remain unvested. The Company currently recognizes no compensation cost for
employee stock options. Based on the adoption of FAS123R
in the first quarter of 2006, the Company estimates the impact
to not exceed an after-tax charge of approximately $06 in
fiscal 2006. FAS123R also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating
cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing
cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot
estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they
depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock
options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior
periods for such excess tax deductions were $75, $113 and $59
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No151, Inventory Costs, an
amendment of Accounting Research BulletinNo43,
Chapter4 FAS151. The amendments
made by FAS151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials
spoilageshould be recognized as current-period charges
and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The guidance is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
The adoption of FAS 151 is not expected to have a material
effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or
results of operations. 53 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No47,
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement
No143 FIN47. FIN47
clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and
clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation. The interpretation requires the accelerated
recognition of certain asset retirement obligations when a fair
value of such obligations can be estimated. The interpretation
became effective for the Company in the fourth quarter of 2005.
The Companys adoption of FIN47 did not have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections FAS 154. This new standard
replaces APB 20 and FAS No3, Reporting Accounting
Changes in Interim Financial Statements. Among other
changes, FAS154 requires retrospective application of a
voluntary change in accounting principle with all prior period
financial statements presented on the new accounting principle,
unless it is impracticable to do so. FAS 154 also requires that
a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long-lived
nonfinancial asset be accounted for prospectively as a change in
estimate, and correction of errors in previously issued
financial statements should be termed a restatement. The new
standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of
errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15,
2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of FAS 154 to
have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FAS13-1,
Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction
Period FSP
FAS13-1.
FSP FAS13-1
requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are
incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental
expense. FSP
FAS13-1 is
effective for reporting periods beginning after
December15, 2005. The Company does not expect FSP
FAS13-1 to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position or
results of operations. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No155, Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Instruments FAS155.
FAS155 allows financial instruments that have embedded
derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need
to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects
to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. This
statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or
issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year
that begins after September15, 2006. The Company does not
expect the adoption of FAS154 to have a material impact on
its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Reclassifications:
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation. Among these, the Company has
reclassified its income and expense related to sales of
merchandise to other retailers from Selling, general and
administrative expense in the Companys consolidated
statements of operations to Other revenue and
Cost of merchandise sold, includes occupancy. In
addition, the Company has reclassified income related to
unredeemed gift cards from Selling, general and
administrative expense to Other revenue. The
reclassification had no impact on earnings or cash flows. 54 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

accordance with the provisions of FAS144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the
Company evaluates the carrying values of long-lived assets
whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts
of such assets may not be recoverable. In the fourth quarter of
2005, the Company recorded a charge of $43 related to the
impairment of certain long-lived assets primarily leasehold
improvements, furniture, and fixtures, consisting of the
following: $21 related to underperforming domestic Borders
superstores, $05 related to underperforming Waldenbooks
Specialty Retail stores and $17 related to underperforming
Books etc. stores. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a charge of
$62related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets
primarily leasehold improvements, furniture, and fixtures,
consisting of the following: $45related to
underperforming domestic Borders superstores, $04related
to underperforming Waldenbooks Specialty Retail stores and
$13related to underperforming Books etc. stores. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of
$69related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets
primarily leasehold improvements, furniture, and fixtures,
consisting of the following: $66related to
underperforming domestic Borders superstores and
$03related to underperforming Waldenbooks Specialty
Retail stores. Also in the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company
incurred a $45charge related to the impairment of certain
capitalized technology initiatives, with $30, $14, and
$01allocated to the Borders, Waldenbooks Specialty Retail
and International segments, respectively. The charges taken for these impairments are categorized as
Asset impairments and other writedowns on the
consolidated statements of operations. Store Closings: In
accordance with the provisions of FAS146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, the
Company expenses when incurred all amounts related to the
discontinuance of operations of stores identified for closure.
These expenses typically pertain to inventory markdowns, asset
impairments, and store payroll and other costs. When the Company
closes any of its stores, the inventory of the closed stores is
either returned to vendors or marked down and sold. Stores
leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment are
generally discarded or sold for nominal amounts. Borders superstores closed during 2005 averaged approximately 20
employees per store and Waldenbooks Specialty Retail stores
closed during 2005 averaged between five to seven employees per
store, who have been or will be displaced by the closures, with
the majority being transferred to other Waldenbooks Specialty
Retail or domestic Borders superstore locations. Those employees
not transferred are eligible for involuntary termination
benefits, but the total amount of these benefits for the stores
affected by the closing plans is not significant. 55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data During 2005, the Company recorded a $34charge for the
closing costs of underperforming stores, consisting of the
following: $10relating to the closure of two Borders
stores, and $24relating to the closure of
50Waldenbooks Specialty Retail stores net of a
$01adjustment of the prior year reserve resulting from
actual costs differing from estimates. The charge for Borders
consisted entirely of asset impairments, and the charge for
Waldenbooks Specialty Retail included $04of asset
impairments and $09of store payroll and other costs.
These costs are categorized as Asset impairments and other
writedowns on the consolidated statements of operations.
Also included in the $24charge is a $11charge for
inventory markdowns of the stores to be closed, categorized as
Cost of merchandise sold includes occupancy on the
consolidated statements of operations. During 2004, the Company recorded a $22charge for the
closing costs relating to the closure of 43underperforming
Waldenbooks Specialty Retail stores net of a
$02adjustment of the prior year reserve resulting from
actual costs differing from estimates. The charge included
$01of asset impairments and $09of store payroll
and other costs. Also included in the $22charge is a
$12charge for inventory markdowns of the stores to be
closed. During 2003, the Company recorded a $14charge for the
closing costs relating to the closure of 74underperforming
Waldenbooks Specialty Retail stores net of a
$09adjustment of the prior year reserve resulting from
actual costs differing from estimates. The charge included $01
of asset impairments and $05 of store payroll and other costs.

of $05, $11 and $01, respectively. These amounts were
categorized as Cost of merchandise sold includes

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 As a result of the terrorist attacks on September11, 2001,
a Borders store that operated in the World Trade Center in New
York City was destroyed. The loss of that stores sales and
net income was not material to the consolidated 2005, 2004 or
2003 results as a whole. The Company was insured for the
replacement value of the assets destroyed at the store and up to
24months of lost income from business interruption
coverage and recognized a total recovery of $199. The Company
does not expect to recover additional insurance amounts related
to this incident. During 2004, the Company recognized as income its final
insurance reimbursement of $12 related to the
September11, 2001 loss. Of this, $09 was categorized as
an offset to Selling, general and administrative
expenses. This amount primarily represented the excess of
lost assets replacement value over their net book value.
It is the Companys policy to record gains and losses on
asset disposals as a part of Selling, general and
administrative expenses. The remaining $03 was related to
pre-opening expenses incurred in the opening of replacement
stores in NewYork City. This was categorized as an offset
to Pre-opening expense on the consolidated
statements of operations. During 2003, the Company recognized a $28gain from
insurance proceeds related to the terrorist attacks. Of this 07 represented business interruption proceeds for 2003. In
addition, $18 primarily represented the excess of lost
assets replacement value over their net book value. The
remaining $03 was related to pre-opening expenses incurred in
the opening of replacement stores in NewYork City. NOTE5 LEGAL SETTLEMENT In January 2004, a settlement was reached pursuant to which the
Company agreed to pay $35, categorized as Legal
settlement expense in the consolidated statements of
operations during 2003, to resolve all claims asserted in the
California overtime litigation. This action was brought by two
former employees, individually and on behalf of a class
consisting of all current and former employees who worked as
assistant managers in Borders stores in the state of California.
The court approved the settlement in December 2004. NOTE6 SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTION In March 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with GE
Pension Limited to sell and subsequently leaseback a
Company-owned property owned by its Books etc. subsidiary. There
were no future commitments, obligations, provisions, or
circumstances included in either the sale contract or the lease
contract that would result in the Companys continuing
involvement; therefore, the assets associated with the property
were removed from the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The transaction was recorded in the International segment. The
sale proceeds were $323 and the net book value of the property
upon the completion date of the sale was $284, and direct costs
associated with the transaction were $04. A deferred gain of
$35 was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in
Other long-term liabilities and is being amortized
over the 20-year term
of the operating lease. NOTE7 ACQUISITION OF PAPERCHASE PRODUCTS,
LTD. In July 2004, the Company invested cash of $241, including debt
repayment of $41, in connection with an increase in its 15%
equity stake in Paperchase Products, Ltd.
Paperchase, a leading stationery retailer in the
United Kingdom, to 97%, which was allocated primarily to fixed
assets, inventory and 57 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data 224 of goodwill. The Company also recorded minority interest
of $10. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase in
the Companys International segment. The acquisition was
not material to the consolidated statements of operations, the
consolidated balance sheets, or the consolidated statements of
cash flows of the Company.   
NOTE8
SEATTLES BEST COFFEE LICENSING AGREEMENT In August 2004, the Company entered into a licensing agreement
with Seattles Best Coffee, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Starbucks Corporation, through which the Company will operate
Seattles Best Coffee-branded cafes within substantially
all of the Companys existing Borders superstores in the
continental U.S. and Alaska and new stores as they are opened.
Cafes located within existing Borders superstores began
conversion to Seattles Best Coffee cafes beginning in
early 2005, and will continue through 2007. These cafes will
continue to be managed and staffed by Company employees, who
will be trained on Seattles Best Coffee brand standards
and procedures. Seattles Best Coffee will also provide
brand direction and oversight, as well as in-store promotional
support, and will receive royalty payments from the Company.

The Company has tax net operating loss carryforwards in foreign
jurisdictions totaling $304 as of January28, 2006, $280
as of January23, 2005, and $346 as of January25,
2004. These losses have an indefinite carryforward period. The
Company has established a valuation allowance to reflect the
uncertainty of realizing a portion of the benefits of these net
operating losses in foreign jurisdictions. Consolidated domestic income lossbefore taxes was $1724
in 2005, $2006 in 2004, and $1897 in 2003. The corresponding
amounts for foreign operations were $133 in 2005, $70 in
2004 and $03 in 2003. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings
of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently
reinvested outside the United States. Cumulative foreign
earnings considered permanently reinvested totaled $219 as of
January28, 2006 and $83 as of January23, 2005. 59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data NOTE11 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation: Two former
employees, individually and on behalf of a purported class
consisting of all current and former employees who work or
worked as Inventory Managers or Sales Managers in Borders stores
in the State of California at any time from September30,
2001 through the trial date, have filed an action against the
Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of
San Francisco. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that
the individual plaintiffs and the purported class members were
improperly classified as exempt employees and that the Company
violated the California Labor Code and the California Business
and Professions Code by failing to ipay required
overtime, iiprovide meal periods, rest periods, and
accurate itemized wage statements, iiikeep accurate
records of employees hours of work, and ivpay all
compensation owed at the time of termination of employment to
certain members of the purported class. The relief sought
includes damages, restitution, penalties, injunctive relief,
interest, costs, and attorneys fees and such other relief
as the court deems proper. The Company intends to vigorously
defend the action. The Company has not included any liability in
its consolidated financial statements in connection with this
matter and has expensed as incurred all legal costs to date. On October29, 2002, Gary Gerlinger, individually and on
behalf of all other similarly situated consumers in the United
States who, during the period from August1, 2001 to the
present, purchased books online from either Amazon.com, Inc.
Amazon or the Company, instituted an action
against the Company and Amazon in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California. The Complaint
alleges that the agreement pursuant to which an affiliate of
Amazon operates Borders.com as a co-branded site the
Mirror Site violates federal anti-trust laws,
California statutory law and the common law of unjust
enrichment. The Complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages,
including treble damages or statutory damages where applicable,
attorneys fees, costs and disbursements, disgorgement of all
sums obtained by allegedly wrongful acts, interest and
declaratory relief. On November1, 2005, the Court granted
the Companys Motion to Dismiss all of the remaining claims
of the plaintiff. The anti-trust claims were dismissed with
prejudice, and the unfair competition claims were dismissed
without prejudice. The plaintiff has appealed the decision. The
Company has not included any liability in its consolidated
financial statements in connection with this matter and has
expensed as incurred all legal costs to date. Certain states and private litigants have sought to impose sales
or other tax collection efforts on out-of-jurisdiction companies
that engage in e-commerce. The Company and Amazon have been
named as defendants in actions filed by a private litigant on
behalf of the state of Illinois under the states False
Claims Act relating to the failure to collect use taxes on
Internet sales in Illinois for periods both before and after the
implementation of the Mirror Site Agreement. The Complaints seek
judgments, jointly and severally, against the defendants for,
among other things, injunctive relief, treble the amount of
damages suffered by the state of Illinois as a result of the
alleged violations of the defendants, penalties, costs and
expenses, including legal fees. Similar actions previously filed
against the Company in Tennessee and Nevada have been dismissed. Although an adverse resolution of any of the matters described
above could have a material adverse effect on the results of the
operations of the Company for the applicable period or periods,
the Company does not believe that these matters will have a
material effect on its liquidity or financial position. In addition to the matters described above, the Company is, from
time to time, involved in or affected by other litigation
incidental to the conduct of its businesses. 60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data NOTE 12 DEBT Credit Facility: The
Company has a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement the
Credit Agreement, which was amended in October 2005
and will expire in October 2010. The Credit Agreement provides
for borrowings of up to $7000 secured by eligible inventory and
accounts receivable and related assets. Borrowings under the
Credit Agreement are limited to a specified percentage of
eligible inventories and accounts receivable and bear interest
at a variable base rate plus an increment or LIBOR plus an
increment at the Companys option. The Credit Agreement
iincludes a fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of
11 to 1 that is applicable only if outstanding borrowings under
the facility exceed 90% of permitted borrowings thereunder,
iicontains covenants that limit, among other things, the
Companys ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make
investments, consolidate or merge or dispose of assets,
iiiprohibits dividend payments and share repurchases
that would result in borrowings under the facility exceeding 90%
of permitted borrowings thereunder, and ivcontains
default provisions that are typical for this type of financing,
including a cross default provision relating to other
indebtedness of more than $250. The Company had borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreement or a prior agreement of
$1536million at January28, 2006 and $1317 at
January23, 2005. The weighted average interest rate in
2005 and 2004 was approximately 60% and 59%, respectively. Term Loan: On
July30, 2002, the Company issued $500 of senior
guaranteed notes the Notes due July30, 2006
and bearing interest at 631% payable semi-annually. The
proceeds of the sale of the Notes were used to refinance
existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and
for general corporate purposes. The note purchase agreement
relating to the Notes contains covenants which limit, among
other things, the Companys ability to incur indebtedness,
grant liens, make investments, engage in any merger or
consolidation, dispose of assets or change the nature of its
business, and requires the Company to meet certain financial
measures regarding net worth, total debt coverage and fixed
charge coverage. In July 2004, the note purchase agreement was
amended to permit the amendment to the Credit Agreement
described above and to provide for a parity lien to secure the
Notes on the same collateral as secures borrowings under the
Credit Agreement. Debt of Consolidated
VIEs: The Company includes
the debt of two variable interest entities VIEs,
consolidated pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities FIN46, in its
consolidated balance sheets. Scheduled principal payments of
this debt as of January28, 2006 total $02 in 2006, $02
in 2007, $02 in 2008, $02 in 2009, $02 in 2010, $46 in all
later years, and in the aggregate, total $56. See
Note13 Leases for further
discussion of the Companys consolidation of these VIEs. As of January28, 2006 the Company was in compliance with
its debt covenants. NOTE 13 LEASES Operating Leases: The
Company conducts operations primarily in leased facilities.
Store leases are generally for terms of three to 20years.
Borders leases generally contain multiple three- to
five-year renewal options which allow Borders the option to
extend the life of the leases up to 25years beyond the
initial noncancellable term. Waldenbooks Specialty Retails
leases generally do not contain renewal options. Certain leases
provide for additional rental payments based on a percentage of
sales in excess of a specified base. Also, certain leases
provide for the payment by the Company of executory costs
taxes, maintenance, and insurance. For leases that contain rent escalations, the Company records
the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease and records the difference
between the rents paid and the straight-line rent as a deferred
rent liability. During 2005, the Company concluded that rent
payments required by several of the International segments
lease agreements were not being recognized on the required
straight-line basis. Specifically, certain lease agreements
contained provisions that 61 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data increased rent payments over time, and the Company had
recognized the effect of these rent escalations in the period
the escalations occurred, rather than on a straight-line basis
over the lease term. As a result, the Company has increased
Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets which includes straight-line rent liabilities
for its International segment by $31, and has increased the
segments Cost of merchandise sold includes
occupancy on the consolidated statements of operations by
the same amount. The after-tax impact of this non-cash
adjustment was $22. Lease Commitments: Future
minimum lease payments under operating leases at
January28, 2006 total $3638 in 2006, $3546 in 2007 3405 in 2008, $3203 in 2009, $2985 in 2010, $2,2096 in all

Capitalized Leases: The
Company accounts for certain items under capital leases.
Scheduled principal payments of capitalized leases as of
January28, 2006 total $05, due in 2006. Lease Financing
Facilities: Prior to 2005,
the Company had two lease financing facilities the
Original Lease Facility and the New Lease
Facility, collectively, the Lease Financing
Facilities to finance new stores and other property owned
by unaffiliated entities and leased to the Company or its
subsidiaries. In July 2004, the Company repaid all amounts
outstanding under the Lease Financing Facilities totaling
$138 on behalf of the two borrowing VIEs. The Company recorded
this debt repayment as a prepayment of a portion of the rent
expense for occupancy through 2024, and classified the current
portion as a component of Accounts receivable and other
current assets, and the non-current portion as a component
of Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets
at January28, 2006. In conjunction with this transaction,
the Lease Financing Facilities were terminated. Consolidated VIEs: The
Company adopted FIN46 as of January25, 2004, which
resulted in the consolidation of four VIEs and an after-tax
charge of $21, comprised of non-cash depreciation costs, in
2003. This charge is included as a Cumulative effect of
accounting change net of tax in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations in 2003. Of the four VIEs
initially consolidated, only two such entities remain
consolidated at January28, 2006, as discussed below. As a result of the repayment and termination of the Lease
Financing Facilities in July 2004, the Company deconsolidated
the two VIEs which had participated in the Lease Financing
Facilities as of July 2004, pursuant to the provisions of
FIN46. The deconsolidation of the two VIEs resulted in a
reduction of land, property and equipment, net of accumulated
depreciation, of $125, short-term borrowings of $138, and
minority interest of $13. The Company also recorded an
after-tax gain of $17 as a result of the deconsolidation of
these VIEs. These amounts have been treated as non-cash items on
the consolidated statements of cash flows. Separately, the Company is the primary beneficiary of two VIEs
due to the Companys guarantee of the debt of these
entities. As a result, the Company consolidates these VIEs and
has recorded property and equipment, net of accumulated
depreciation, of $53, long-term debt including current
portion of $56, and minority interest of $03 at
January28, 2006. 62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data NOTE 14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Employee Savings Plan:
Employees of the Company who meet certain requirements as to age
and service are eligible to participate in the Companys
Savings Plan. The Companys expense related to this plan
was $50, $47, and $43 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. NOTE 15 STOCK-BASED BENEFIT PLANS 2004 Long-Term Incentive
Plan: The Company maintains
the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan,
pursuant to which the Company may grant stock-based awards to
employees and non-employee directors of the Company, including
restricted shares and share units of its common stock and
options to purchase its common stock. The 2004 Plan was approved
by shareholders in May 2004, and replaced all prior stock-based
benefit plans on a go-forward basis. Three million shares were
authorized for the grant of stock-based awards under the 2004
Plan plus any shares forfeited or cancelled under the 2004 Plan
or any prior plan. At January28, 2006 38million
shares remained available for grant. Under the 2004 Plan, the exercise price of options granted will
generally not be less than the fair value per share of the
Companys common stock at the date of grant. The plan
provides for vesting periods as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The Companys senior management personnel are required to
use 20%, and may use up to 100%, of their annual incentive
bonuses to purchase restricted shares of the Companys
common stock, at a 20% to 40% discount from the fair value of
the same number of unrestricted shares of common stock. In
addition, the Companys senior management personnel may
elect to make a one-time purchase of restricted shares.
Restricted shares of common stock purchased under the 2004 Plan
will generally be restricted from sale or transfer for at least
two and up to four years from date of purchase. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the discount on
restricted shares of common stock purchased under the 2004 Plan
or prior plan. Such discounts are recognized as expense on a
straight-line basis over the period during which the shares are
restricted from sale or transfer. The Company grants performance-based share units of its common
stock RSUs to its senior management personnel.
RSUs vest in amounts based on the achievement of performance
goals, primarily earnings per share. The Compensation Committee
of the Companys Board of Directors establishes the
RSUs performance criteria and vesting period. The Company
also grants time-vested restricted stock to its senior
management personnel. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the
performance-based share units of common stock granted under the
2004 Plan using variable accounting, in accordance with the
provisions of APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Under variable accounting, estimates of
compensation costs are recorded and updated each period until
the measurement date, based on changes in the Companys
share price and the estimated vesting period of the RSUs. Employee Stock Purchase
Plan: The Company maintained
an employee stock purchase plan the Employee Plan,
which allowed the Companys associates not eligible under
the 2004 Plan to purchase shares of the Companys common
stock at a 15% discount from their fair market value. The
Employee Plan expired as of December31, 2005. 63 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

NOTE 16 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate
fluctuations, as interest on certain of the Companys
borrowings is based on variable rates. The Companys
objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations
is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and
cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. During
2005, the Company utilized two interest rate swaps to achieve
this objective, effectively converting a portion of its variable
rate exposure to fixed interest rates. In accordance with the
provisions of FAS 133, the Company designated these interest
rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges. These two interest
rate swaps settled during the second quarter of 2005, and the
cumulative loss was realized, totaling less than $01. 65 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued dollars in millions except per share data The Company recognizes the fair value of its derivatives on the
consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is designated as, and meets all the required
criteria for, a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings as the
underlying hedged item affects earnings. Amounts reclassified
into earnings related to cash flow hedges are included in
interest expense. The hedge ineffectiveness for the year ending
January28, 2006 was zero. A portion of the Companys borrowings is based on a fixed
interest rate. In August 2003, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap to convert the fixed rate, upon which the
$500 of Notes are based, to a variable rate based on LIBOR. In
accordance with the provisions of FAS133, the Company has
designated this swap agreement as a fair market value hedge.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as,
and meets all the required criteria for, a fair market value
hedge are recorded in the Companys consolidated statements
of operations, as are changes in the fair value of the hedged
debt. As of January28, 2006, and January23, 2005, the
Company had the following interest rate swaps in effect

segments: domestic Borders superstores, Waldenbooks Specialty
Retail stores, International stores including Borders, Books
etc. and Paperchase stores, and Corporate consisting of the
unallocated portion of interest expense, certain corporate
governance costs and corporate incentive costs. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Segment
data includes charges allocating all corporate headquarters
costs to each segment. Transactions between segments, consisting
principally of inventory transfers, are recorded primarily at
cost. Interest income and expense are allocated to segments
based upon the cash flow generated or absorbed by those
segments. The Company utilizes fixed interest rates,
approximating the Companys medium-term borrowing and
investing rates, in calculating segment interest income and
expense. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments
and allocates resources to them based on anticipated future
contribution.

69 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Borders Group, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Borders Group, Inc. the Company as of January28, 2006
and January23, 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended January28,
2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company at
January28, 2006 and January23, 2005, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January28,
2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. As discussed in Note13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities effective
January25, 2004. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Borders Group, Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of January28, 2006 based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of

Item 5.Controls and Procedures Controls and Procedures:
The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange
Act, as of January28, 2006 the Evaluation
Date. Based on such evaluation, such officers have
concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures were effective in alerting
them on a timely basis to material information relating to the
Company including its consolidated subsidiaries required to be
included in the Companys periodic filings under the
Exchange Act. Changes in Internal
Control: During the quarter
ended January28, 2006, the Company continued
implementation of a new merchandising system in Waldenbooks,
which it began during the third quarter of 2005. The Company
believes the controls over the processes affected by the
implementation are functioning effectively as of
January28, 2006. Also during the quarter ended
January28, 2006, the Company continued its review of its
internal controls over the selection and monitoring of
appropriate assumptions and factors affecting lease accounting
practices. As a result, the Company implemented additional
controls over international leases during the quarter ending
January28, 2006. The Company believes these controls are
functioning effectively as of January28, 2006. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting:
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rule13a-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of January28,
2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control Integrated Framework. Based on this
assessment, management has concluded that, as of
January28, 2006, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Companys independent registered public accounting firm,
Ernst Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the
Companys assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting as of January28, 2006,
which is included herein. 71 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Borders Group, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting included in Item9A, that Borders
Group, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January28, 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Borders Group,
Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 72 Table of Contents In our opinion, managements assessment that Borders Group,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January28, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our
opinion, Borders Group, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of January28, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Borders Group, Inc. as of
January28, 2006 and January23, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January28, 2006 of Borders Group, Inc., and our report
dated April5, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
