INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
ChromaVision Medical Systems, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
ChromaVision Medical Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and
1999 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity
deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ChromaVision
Medical Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

CHROMAVISION MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 ORGANIZATION
OVERVIEW
ChromaVision develops, manufactures and markets an automated cellular
imaging system, referred to as the ACIS, which is designed to assist in the
detection, diagnosis and treatment of cellular diseases such as cancer and
infectious disease. ChromaVision has designed the ACIS system to serve as a tool
to assist, rather than replace, the pathologist in generating accurate,
quantitative and reproducible results, eliminating the subjectivity associated
with current manual methods. On July 28, 1999, the FDA granted clearance for the
use of the ACIS to perform tests using a particular staining method based upon a
master validation protocol. The FDA clearance allows ChromaVision to introduce
tests for the ACIS using that staining method without having to apply for
additional FDA clearance. ChromaVision current test menu for the ACIS includes
seven tests currently released with additional tests in various stages of
development.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the results of
operations, account balances and cash flows of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
b Change in Development Stage Status
From the inception of the ChromaVision business on April 1, 1993 to
September 30, 1999, the business was considered to be in the development stage
as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 7,
Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises. The Company exited,
in the fourth quarter of 1999, the development stage as significant revenue was
realized from planned operations.
c Revenue Recognition
The Company revenues in 1997 were derived from the provision of
technical services. In 1998 and 1999, revenues were derived from the leasing of
ACIS systems in addition to an ACIS system sale in 1999. Technical service
revenue was recognized at the completion of the performance of the related
engineering services.
The Company anticipates placing most of its instruments with users at
no charge and billing on a per-test or per-use basis. The Company will
obtain the billing information primarily via a modem, which accesses the ACIS
database. Revenue is recognized as usage occurs but with a minimum monthly
rental in place. It is anticipated that under this pricing model, the Company
will own most of the ACIS instruments that are engaged in service and,
accordingly, all development and maintenance costs will be expensed in cost of
sales as incurred. For those instruments that are sold, revenue is recognized
upon acceptance by the customer subsequent to a testing and evaluation period.
During such time period, the Company maintains ownership of the ACIS.
d Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments in Marketable Securities
Cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts held as bank deposits and
highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less. The
Company also has investments in short-term debt securities that have been
classified under the provisions of SFAS No. 115 as held to maturity. Management
has the intent and ability to hold these investments to maturity, and
accordingly the investments are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost
and temporary unrealized gains or losses are not recognized.
The short-term investments have various maturity dates, which do not
exceed one year.
Cash equivalents and short-term investments are comprised of investment
grade corporate bonds and commercial paper, and no single investment exceeds 5%
of the combined total of cash and cash equivalents, investments and notes
receivable.                    25
26
The Company has not experienced any significant losses on cash, cash
equivalents, or investments. The Company believes it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk on cash, cash equivalents or investments.
e Depreciation and Amortization
Property and equipment are depreciated and amortized on the straight-line
basis over the following estimated useful lives                                  
Office, Computer and Laboratory   3 to 5 years
Automated Cellular Imaging Systems   3 years
Furniture and   5 years
Leasehold   Life of lease     Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are
charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements and additions are
capitalized. ChromaVision ACIS instruments begin depreciation upon placement at
which time depreciation related to ACIS instruments placed for research and
development or placed for commercial use are expensed in research and
development or cost of sales, respectively.
The following is a summary of property and equipment                                DECEMBER 31,
1998     1999

Property and equipment, net..  $2,891,471  $4,344,891
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If
the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the assets, a loss is
recognized for the difference. f Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.
g Stock-Based Compensation
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 for stock options and other
stock-based awards while disclosing pro forma net loss and net loss per share as
if the fair value method had been applied in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS No123 see Note 5. The fair value of options granted to
non-employees is expensed over the performance period or at the time when a
performance commitment is reached.
h Net Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted loss per common share is calculated by dividing net
loss by the average common shares outstanding during the year. Stock options to
purchase 1,818,513, 2,050,938 and 2,121,675 shares of common stock were
outstanding at December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999. These stock options outstanding
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
Company incurred a loss in all periods presented and hence, the impact would be
antidilutive.                    26
27
i Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company financial statements, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
j Financial Instruments
The Company estimates the fair value of its monetary assets and
liabilities based upon the existing interest rates related to such assets and
liabilities compared to current market rates of interest for instruments with a
similar nature and degree of risk. The Company estimates that the fair value of
all of its monetary assets and liabilities approximates the recorded value as of
December 31, 1998 and 1999.
k Recent Accounting Developments
In June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities was issued, as
amended. The provisions of the statement require the recognition of all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet
and the measurement of those instruments at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the
derivative and the resulting designation. This statement is effective for all
fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company does
not believe that adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on
the financial statements.
l Foreign Currency Translation
The financial position and results of operations of the Company
foreign subsidiaries are generally determined using their local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated
at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.
Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from
period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in
stockholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction and translation losses were
$0, $0 and $28,630 for the year ending 1997, 1998 and 1999.
m Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
1999 presentation.
3 LINE OF CREDIT
On June 9, 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with its
principal bank for a $5,000,000 revolving line of credit. The line expires May
30, 2000 and the Company may seek to extend or renegotiate another line of
credit. At the Company option, the interest rate is either prime less 25% or
LIBOR plus 175%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit
during the period. Any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit will be
collateralized by the Company investment in securities held by the principal

of grant. Stock options granted have a maximum of ten-year terms and become
exercisable in increments over periods of up to four years.
The Company granted non-qualified stock options in 1997, 1998 and 1999

The Company applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for stock option plans. Had compensation cost been recognized consistent with
SFAS No. 123, the Company consolidated net loss and loss per share would have
been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below                            1997        1998        1999

on the date of grant.
The following assumptions were used by the Company to determine the

outstanding which had an option price exceeding $650. The vesting dates with
respect to such options were extended six months; however, all other terms were
maintained. The                    28

Company did not recognize compensation expense related to the repricing of the
employee stock options, as the adjusted exercise price was equal to the fair
value of the common stock as of the repricing date.

be utilized in the future.

Company has tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes
of $300,000 and $204,000, respectively, which are available to offset future

7 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
XL Vision provided certain personnel and administrative services to the
Company through June 1997. Related charges were either allocated to the Company
or charged under an administrative service agreement. Allocations consisted of
all direct costs and certain indirect costs based upon the proportional value of
all expenses incurred by XL Vision. Management of the Company believes the
allocated costs reasonably reflect the costs of the operations of the Company as
if it were on a stand-alone basis. Administrative service fees allocated or
charged amounted to $260,000 in 1997 and none in 1998 and 1999.
Effective January 1997, the Company entered into an additional
administrative service agreement which specifies a fee based upon a percentage
of gross revenues. The fee is payable quarterly to Safeguard and XL Vision based
upon an aggregate of 15% 75% each of gross revenues subject to an annual
limit of $300,000. The fee is payable upon achievement of positive cash flow
from operations. The agreement extends through January 31, 2002 and continues
thereafter unless terminated by either party. As of December 31, 1999,
approximately $5,000 has been accrued under this agreement. Per the initial
stock purchase agreement, the Company paid Safeguard $50,000 for services in
connection with the initial public offering.                    29

8 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Agreement with Centocor, Inc. The Company sold Centocor, Inc. six ACIS
units in 1995 to facilitate Centocor clinical trials for cancer applications.
As Centocor received feedback from those trials the Company, which was
continuing its research and development efforts, incorporated the feedback into
its technology. In July 1996, both parties entered into an agreement stipulating
their various rights to the reagents being tested for cancer and the ACIS
technology. As an outcome of this agreement, the Company agreed to a put option
by which Centocor would have the right to return the six instruments for
$800,000 and the issuance of 770,192 shares of preferred stock at $100. As a
result of this agreement, the Company recognized $770,192 of research and
development expenses during 1996. During December 1996, negotiations commenced
which prompted Centocor waiver of its rights to return the six instruments and
extinguished any commitment to repurchase these instruments. In exchange for
Centocor waiver, the Company agreed to provide a specified number of hours of
technical support and software development services through September 1997.
Voluntary Employee Savings 401k Plan. The Company has a voluntary
employee savings 401k plan, which is available to all full time employees' 21
years or older. The plan provides for a matching by the Company of the
employee contribution to the plan for 50% of the first 6% of the employee
annual compensation. The Company matching contributions were approximately
$36,000, $79,000 and $116,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and
1999, respectively.
Lease Commitment. The Company leases furniture and office space under
existing operating leases which expire in 2000. The Company has exercised its
option to extend the office lease to February 2001 and will exercise its option
to extend the furniture lease an additional year. Rental commitments under these
agreements for 2000 and 2001 are approximately $168,000 and $40,000,
respectively. Total rent expense related to these leases was approximately
$139,000, $163,000 and $163,000 for years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999.
Litigation. On April 21, 1998, the Company signed a settlement
agreement with IDEA Research LLC IDEA Research related to litigation filed
by the Company on November 10, 1997 involving, among other things, a claim by
IDEA Research of patent infringement against the Company. The agreement
contemplates a collaboration between both parties on a screening test for Down
syndrome for a period of two years and provides for the grant of a license to
the Company under the patent, an up front payment by the Company of $300,000
upon the signing of the settlement agreement, a $150,000 payment if certain
requirements with respect to commercializing the Down syndrome screening test
are met and a five percent royalty payable to IDEA Research on net collectible
revenues for each Down syndrome screening test performed. In April 1998, the
$300,000 up front payment was paid to IDEA Research and included in legal
settlement charges on the statement of operations.
9 STOCK TRANSACTIONS
In August 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering and
sold 6,020,000 shares of common stock. The Company received net proceeds of
approximately $284 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering
expenses. Approximately $55 million of the net proceeds were used for repayment
of a bank line of credit indebtedness and reduction of an inter-company payable
to XL Vision, Inc.
On October 7, 1999, the Company completed a private placement of
1,775,000 shares of common stock to selected institutional and other accredited
investors. The net proceeds to the Company from the sale of the shares were
approximately $186 million.
In March 1999, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan, which
provides each stockholder of the Company with one right for each share of common
stock held. Generally, if a person or entity becomes the beneficial owner of 15%
or more of the Company outstanding common stock, each right other than those
held by that new 15% stockholder would be exercisable to purchase that number
of shares of the Company Common Stock having, at that time, a market value
equal to two times the then current exercise price. The exercise price will
initially be $30 per right, subject to adjustment for certain events. Certain
acquisitions by the holders of 15% or more of the Company Common Stock on the
date the Stockholder Rights Plan was adopted do not result in the rights
becoming exercisable.
The record date set for distribution of the rights under the Rights
Plan was March 22, 1999, and after that date any shares of common stock traded
will automatically be accompanied by the associated rights. No separate
certificate will be issued to evidence the Rights until they become exercisable.
The rights expire on February 9, 2009 unless they previously became
exercisable, and are subject to redemption by the Board of Directors of the
Company at $001 per right at any time prior to the first date upon which they
become exercisable.                    30

effective rate of borrowing less 75% 560% at June 30, 1999. Interest income
