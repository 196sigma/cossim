Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Sealed Air Corporation: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders' equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement scheduleIIvaluation and qualifying accounts and reserves. We also have audited Sealed Air Corporation
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Sealed Air Corporation management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule, and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also in our opinion, Sealed Air Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria 
51  established
in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
As
discussed in Notes14 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, effective January1, 2006, and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an Amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R, effective

Note1Organization and Nature of Operations 
Sealed Air Corporation, operating through its subsidiaries, or the Company, is a leading global innovator and manufacturer of a wide range of packaging and
performance-based materials and equipment systems that serve an array of food, industrial, medical and consumer applications. The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US. These two subsidiaries directly
and indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in
connection with the Cryovac transaction. See Cryovac Transaction, of Note16, Commitments and Contingencies, for a description of the Cryovac transaction and related terms used in these
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In
the second quarter of 2007, the Company expanded and realigned its segment reporting. The Company now reports publicly in four parts, three reportable segments and an other
category. See Note3, Business Segment Information, for further discussion of the Company new segment reporting. 
Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all significant intercompany
transactions and balances in consolidation. All amounts are approximate due to rounding. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Reclassifications, individually and in the aggregate, had an immaterial effect on the Company consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
On
February16, 2007, the Company Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split that was effected in the form of a stock dividend. All share and
per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split except for shareholders' equity. See Note17, Shareholders' Equity, for further discussion. Net
earnings per common share for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 have been revised. See Note18, Net Earnings per Common Share, for further discussion. 
The
Company, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements, or SAB108, increased its beginning retained earnings balance for fiscal 2006 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. See Note21, Recent Accounting
Pronouncements, for additional information on the application of SAB108. Use of Estimates 
The preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, or U.S.GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include, among other items, assessing the collectibility of receivables, the
use and recoverability of inventory, the realization of deferred tax assets, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets, assumptions used in the Company defined benefit
pension plans, estimates related to self-insurance such as the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and estimated trends in
claim values and accruals for commitments and contingencies. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effects of revisions in the consolidated financial statements
in the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Financial Instruments  The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign currency exchange forward contracts and
options relating to the Company borrowing and trade activities. 
The
Company may use these financial instruments from time to time to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not
purchase, hold or sell
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations. However, the
Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are major financial institutions with high credit ratings. The
Company reports all derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into
for hedging purposes. Prior to entering into any derivative transaction, the Company identifies the specific financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce the risk, and
the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to
be hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews its hedge positions and the
correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments. The
Company accounts for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments
are effective as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions. 
The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying
transactions are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations, at which time the Company recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognizes
gains and losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated statements of operations. 
The
Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the
period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction is recognized. Foreign Currency Translation 
In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with
translation adjustments accumulated in shareholders' equity. The Company translates the statements of operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The Company translates
assets and liabilities of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at
historical exchange rates. In countries with highly inflationary economies, the Company translates items reflected in statements of operations at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
period, except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates.

Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation 
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it. While it is typically very difficult to
determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual
outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has
previously made. The Company expenses legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company
has completed the process by which it is entitled to receive consideration. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, shipment has
occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
Sales
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from net sales on the consolidated statements of
operations. 
Research and Development 
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were $908million in 2007, $782million in 2006
and $758million in 2005. In 2007, the Company included certain expenses for technical customer support and facility occupancy costs in reseach and development expenses that were previously
included in marketing and administrative expenses. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment, which replaces SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123 revised covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements and requires that the compensation cost related to these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost is measured based on the fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. The Company primary stock-based employee compensation program is its 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, which replaced the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan. See
Note17, Shareholders' Equity, for further information on these plans.  Terminated Stock Option Plans  As of March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac transaction see Note16, Commitments and Contingencies, the Company terminated stock option
plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated prior to that date, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had
been granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans in 1998 had fully
vested prior to December31, 2000. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future.

Environmental Expenditures 
The Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments
or remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate the cost or a range of costs associated therewith. 
Income Taxes 
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries filea consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company non-U.S. subsidiaries file income
tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions. The Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested
indefinitely in their businesses. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax
that might be payable on the portion of those accumulated earnings that the Company believes are reinvested indefinitely. 
The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method required by SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in
the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carry forwards. The Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period using
enacted tax rates. 
In
2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN48. Under FIN48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than
not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such
positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense on its consolidated statements of operations. See Note15, Income Taxes, for further discussion. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company
policy is to invest cash in excess of short-term operating and debt service requirements in cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities. Cash equivalents are
stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short maturity of the instruments. 
Available-for-Sale Investments 
The Company determines the classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reassesses it as of each balance sheet date.
Available-for-sale securities are marked-to-market based on quoted market values of the securities, with the unrealized gains or losses, if any,
reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, until realized. The Company recognizes realized gains and losses on the sales of the securities on a specific identification method
and includes the realized gains or losses in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company includes interest and dividends on securities classified as
available-for-sale in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. 
The
Company available-for-sale investments at December31, 2007 and 2006 consisted of auction rate securities, which were classified as
non-current assets at December31, 2007 and as current assets at December31, 2006. See Note5, Available-for-Sale Investments, for further
discussion of the Company investments at December31, 2007 and 2006.

Accounts Receivable Securitization 
The Company two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they sell eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn may sell an undivided
ownership interest in these receivables to participating banks or an issuer of commercial paper administered by one of the participating banks. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the receivables it
purchases from the two operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells interests to the banks or to the issuer of commercial paper. If the wholly-owned subsidiary sells undivided ownership
interests in receivables, the Company removes the transferred ownership interest amounts from its balance sheet at the time of the sale and reflects the proceeds from the sale in cash provided by
operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The
Company reflects retained receivables in receivables, net, on its consolidated balance sheets, and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the relatively
short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated with the sale of receivables in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. 
On
December7, 2007, the parties to the accounts receivable securitization program extended this program for an additional five year term. See Note6, Accounts Receivable
Securitization Program, for further discussion. 
Receivables 
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, which are
included in receivables, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, are net of allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from
the failure of its customers to make required payments. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of the Company customers deteriorates. 
Inventories 
The Company determines the cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis. The cost of U.S. equipment
inventories and most non-U.S. inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out or
FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or market. The sale of inventory and the related accounts receivable are classified as an operating activity in the Company
consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Property and Equipment 
The Company states property and equipment at cost, except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the Company reduces the carrying amount to
the estimated fair value at the impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements, and the Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to
expense as incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition
of the assets. 
The
Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis as follows: buildings20 to 40years;
machinery and equipment5 to 10years; and other property and equipment3 to 10years. 
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in business combinations. The Company reflects 
62 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued identifiable
intangible assets in other assets, net. These assets consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements. The Company
amortizes identifiable intangible assets over the shorter of their stated or statutory duration or their estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 3 to 15 years, on a straight-line
basis to their estimated residual values and reviews these intangible assets for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. Identifiable intangibles individually and in the aggregate comprise less than 5% of the Company consolidated assets. 
The
Company uses the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations and does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead tests such
assets for impairment on a reporting unit basis annually. The Company may initiate a review of goodwill prior to conducting the annual analysis if there is evidence that events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. 
A
reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segmentthe component leveldiscrete financial information is
prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in
which case the component
is the reporting unit. The Company uses a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. The Company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of
goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole and for each of the Company reporting units using an income approach, which uses
forecasted earnings and cash flows, and a market approach, which uses comparisons to other businesses. The Company performs this annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. 
Long-Lived Assets  Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever there is evidence that events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from
long-lived assets are less than their carrying value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount.
The Company records assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment, where management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost of disposition. The Company suspends depreciation for these assets during the disposal period, which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of
impairment losses, such as future cash flows, which are based on operational performances, market conditions and other factors and disposition costs, may affect the carrying value of
long-lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Company consolidated financial statements.  Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations  The Company recognizes a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. A conditional asset
retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the
control of the Company. In addition, the Company would record a corresponding amount by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is depreciated over the useful
life of such long-lived asset.

Note2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Self-Insurance 
The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company
accrues for outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using
historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments,
it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. 
Pensions 
The Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most U.S. employees of the
Company are eligible to participate. For a limited number of its U.S. employees and for some of its non-U.S. employees, the Company maintains defined benefit pension plans. The Company
accounts for these pension plans in accordance with SFAS No158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. The Company reviews and approves the
assumptions made by its actuaries regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations,
the expected future rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. The measurement date used to determine the benefit
obligations and the plan assets is December31. In general, material changes to these assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recorded under SFAS No158. 
Earnings per Common Share 
The Company calculates earnings per common share in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings per share, or SFAS No128. Basic earnings per common
share is calculated by dividing net earnings ascribed to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In calculating diluted earnings per common
share, the diluted weighted average number of common shares provides for: 1the conversion of the Company 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033, 2the assumed issuance of
shares of common stock reserved for the Company previously announced asbestos settlement, 3the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases, and
4non-vested restricted stock and non-vested restricted stock units using the treasury stock method, if their inclusion is dilutive. Net earnings ascribed to common
shareholders are adjusted to reflect the reduction to interest expense, net of income taxes, that would occur as a result of the assumed conversion of the 3% convertible senior notes. See
Note18, Net Earnings Per Common Share, for further discussion. 
Note3Business Segment Information 
Expanded Segment Reporting; New Structure  Introduction  During 2007, the Company expanded and realigned its segment reporting to reflect its growth strategies both in core markets and in new business opportunities.
This new structure reflects the way management now makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of its business. It also corresponds with management current approach to
allocating resources and assessing the performance of the Company segments. As a result, the Company now reports business segment information as described below. The Company business segment
information is reported in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No131. The
Company initiatives include developing technologies and innovative products for food, protective and medical packaging applications as well as identifying new performance solutions
involving specialty

from renewable materials. Through its Biosphere venture, the Company is developing packaging materials from renewable resources. The Company intends to sell these products to food processors,
distributors, supermarket retailers and foodservice businesses.  Discussion and Recast  The Company evaluates the performance of each reportable segment based on operating profit, which includes allocations for such corporate expenses as business
development, customer service, finance, information services, people and performance and legal. It does not include restructuring and other charges or any income or loss amounts below operating profit
on the Company consolidated statements of operations. The Company allocates depreciation expense for property and equipment to the reportable segments and the Other category, although property and
equipment, net, is not allocated to the reportable segment assets. The accounting policies of the reportable segments and the Other category are consistent with those described in Note2,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Only assets that are identifiable and reviewed by the Company chief operating decision maker by segment are allocated to the reportable segment assets.
Allocated assets include trade accounts receivable, net, and finished goods inventories, net. All other assets are included in Assets not allocated. Assets not allocated include goodwill of
$1,9697million at December31, 2007 and $1,9571million at December31, 2006 and total property and equipment, net, of $1,0801million at December31,
2007 and $9701million at December31, 2006. 
In
accordance with SFAS No131, the following segment information for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005 have been recast from the amounts previously reported to
reflect the Company new reportable segments. Accordingly, there has been no change in the Company December31, 2006 and 2005 consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance
sheets previously reported in total for the Company.

at December31, 2006. 
Allocation of Goodwill to Reportable Segments  In accordance with SFAS No131 and because the Company management views goodwill as a corporate asset, the Company does not allocate the goodwill
balance to its reportable segments. However, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS No142, the Company is required to
allocate goodwill to each reporting unit in order to perform its annual impairment review of goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year. Due
to the changes in the Company segment reporting structure during 2007, management reassigned goodwill to its new reporting units using a relative fair value approach and reassigned
assets and liabilities to these reporting units in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. After this evaluation was completed, management determined that there were no events or
circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Accordingly, management concluded it was not necessary to test goodwill for
impairment before the Company next annual impairment review. 
During
the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company obtained a detailed determination of its fair values by reporting unit under its new segment reporting structure and performed its annual
goodwill impairment review. The Company completed the required annual impairment review, which resulted in no impairment of goodwill in 2007. 
The
allocation of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142 and the changes in the year ended December31, 2007 by the Company new segment reporting
structure were as follows: Balance at

Note4Global Manufacturing Strategy, Restructuring and Other Charges  Global Manufacturing Strategy and Restructuring Charges  The Company global manufacturing strategy, when fully implemented, will expand production in countries where demand for the Company products and services has
been growing significantly. At the same time, the Company intends to optimize certain manufacturing capacity in North America and Europe into centers of excellence. The goals of this
multi-year program are to expand capacity in growing markets, further improve the Company operating efficiencies, and implement new technologies more effectively. The Company expects
this program to produce meaningful savings in future years. By taking advantage of new technologies and streamlining production on a global scale, the Company expects to continue to enhance its
profitable growth and its global leadership position. 
In
July 2006, the Company announced the first phase of this multi-year global manufacturing strategy. The capital expenditures and associated costs and related restructuring
charges for this strategy in 2007 and 2006 are included in the table below. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company revised the expected range of associated costs and restructuring charges. The
Company currently expects capital expenditures to be approximately $700million and associated costs and restructuring charges to be approximately $300million

restructuring charges were primarily for severance costs, the majority of which are related to the Food Packaging segment. These charges were included in restructuring and other
charges on the consolidated statements of operations. See Note3, Business Segment Information, for restructuring and other charges by business segment and other. A reconciliation of the
restructuring accrual is included below. The
components of the restructuring accrual, spending and other activity through December31, 2007 and the accrual balance remaining at December31, 2007 were as follows: Employee
Termination Costs Original restructuring accrual in 2006 116 Cash payments during 2006 04 Effect of changes in currency rates 03 Restructuring accrual at December31, 2006 109 Cash payments during 2007 45 Additional accruals for new projects or modifications to previously accrued projects 02 Effect of changes in currency rates 16 Restructuring accrual at December31, 2007 82 The
Company expects to pay $55million of the accrual balance remaining at December31, 2007 within the next twelve months. This amount is included in other current
liabilities on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007. The remaining accrual of $27million is expected to be paid in 2010 and 2011 and is included in other
liabilities on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007. 
In
connection with this strategy the Company expects to eliminate 280 full-time positions and add approximately 120 full-time positions at other facilities as
production is transferred. As a result, the net reduction in full-time positions is expected to be 160.

Note4Global Manufacturing Strategy, Restructuring and Other Charges Continued  Other Restructuring Charges  In 2007, the Company recorded $09million of restructuring charges, net, primarily for severance costs incurred in connection with the Company
consolidation of its customer service activities in North America. 
In
2006, the Company recorded $11million of restructuring charges of which $06million related to severance costs incurred in connection with the Company consolidation
of its food packaging customer service activities in Canada and $05million was related to a series of profit improvement plans in various geographic regions of its food packaging segment
implemented in 2004. In 2005, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $17million also related to the profit improvement plans implemented in 2004. Note5Available-for-Sale Investments

auction rate securities that the Company has invested in are typically re-auctioned every seven to twenty-eight days. However, as a result of liquidity conditions
affecting capital markets, particularly in the U.S., specifically for asset-backed securities, every auction for the securities held by the Company over the last several months of 2007 failed. Due to
the failed auctions, the Company has recognized unrealized losses in other comprehensive income of $39million $24million net of taxes for the reduction in fair market value of
these securities at December31, 2007. The Company believes that the decline in fair market value is indicative of the severe pressure from the sub-prime lending collapse that began
during the second half of 2007, rather than specific concerns with respect to the issuers of the auction rate securities in which the Company has invested or the securities themselves. The auction
rate securities in which the Company has invested consist of debt instruments and perpetual preferred securities. At December31, 2007, Moody Investors Service ratings of these securities
ranged from Aa to Aaa and Standard and Poor ratings ranged from AA to AAA. 
The
Company believes that the gross unrealized losses on these securities are temporary in nature and the Company has the intent and, it believes, the ability to hold these securities
until they have recovered their cost basis. The Company currently anticipates that the market for these securities will be re-established within 18months of December31,
2007, but it is possible that a recovery may occur beyond this time period. The Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its operating cash needs without the sale of these securities.
As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company has classified these investments as non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007. 
At
December31, 2006, the Company available-for-sale investments consisted of $339million of auction rate securities, which were investments in
preferred stock with no maturity dates
and were included in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2006. The fair value of these investments was equal to their cost.

Note5Available-for-Sale Investments Continued There
were no gross realized gains or losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities in 2007 and 2006. Interest and dividend rates were generally reset for
periods of up to 90days. 
Note6Accounts Receivable Securitization Program 
In December 2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of
commercial paper administered by the bank. The program had an expiration date of December31, 2004, which was extended on that date for an additional three years. On December7, 2007,
those parties, together with an additional bank and an additional issuer of commercial paper, entered into new agreements amending and extending the program. The program is now scheduled to terminate
on December2, 2012. The amendments increased the maximum purchase limit for receivables interests from $1250million to $1350million. 
Under
this receivables program, the Company two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US, sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts
receivable to Sealed Air Funding Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables program. Sealed Air Funding in
turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the issuers of commercial paper or to one of the banks, subject to specified conditions, up to a maximum of $1350million of
receivables interests outstanding from time to time. 
Sealed
Air Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells receivables interests to the purchasers under the program. The
Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding and the sales of receivables interests from Sealed Air Funding to the purchasers as true
sales under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of the Company other subsidiaries or affiliates. The Company accounts for
these transactions as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. 
To
secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables program, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank
that is acting as administrative agent under the program in accounts receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral. The banks and issuers of commercial
paper under the program have no recourse to the Company, the operating subsidiaries' or Sealed Air Funding other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay
amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a termination event with respect to the receivables program has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect
the receivables under the receivables program as agents on behalf of Sealed Air Funding, the banks and the issuers of commercial paper. 
Prior
to a termination event under the receivables program, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid to the banks or the issuers of commercial
paper to purchase new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their obligations under the receivables program. The
receivables program contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage and debt leverage. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December31, 2007. 
Under
limited circumstances, the banks and the issuers of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates. A downgrade of the Company
long-term senior unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard Poor Rating Services or Ba3 or below by Moody Investors Service,Inc., or failure to comply with
interest coverage and debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the receivables program.

Air Funding did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables program during 2007 or 2006, so the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated
assets reflected on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2007 and 2006. 
At
December31, 2006 the receivables program provided for a program fee of 0375% per annum on the greater of the unpaid amount of the receivables interests sold by Sealed Air
Funding and 50% of the then $1250million purchase limit under the program. The receivables program also provided for a commitment fee of 020% per annum on the lesser of the unused portion of
the program and 50% of the purchase limit under the program. At December31, 2007, the receivables program provided for grid pricing based on usage in which the program fee could range from
0375% to 0450% and the commitment fee could range from 0150% to 0250%, with all fees based on the current $1350million purchase limit under the program. 
The
costs associated with the receivables program are reflected in other income, net, in the Company consolidated statements of operations for the three years ended December31,
2007. These costs primarily relate to program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were $04million for 2007, $03million for 2006 and $04million for 2005.
There were no costs related to the loss on the sale of receivables interests in 2007 or 2006 since the Company did not sell any receivables interests during those years. Such costs were immaterial in
2005.

Company determines the value of non-equipment U.S. inventories by the last-in, first-out or LIFO inventory method. The value of U.S. inventories
determined by that method amounted to $1253million and $1270million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. If the Company had used the first-in,
first-out or FIFO inventory method, which approximates replacement value, for these inventories, the balances would have been $541million higher at December31, 2007 and
$487million higher at December31, 2006. As
a result of the Company application of SAB108 on January1, 2006, the Company recorded an adjustment to inventories. See Staff Accounting Bulletin No108,

Note11Debt and Credit Facilities Continued  Revolving Credit Facilities  The Credit FacilityThe Company has not borrowed under its $5000million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit
facility since its inception in July 2005. This facility contains a provision under which the Company was permitted to request, prior to each of the first and second anniversaries of the facility, a
one-year extension of the term of the facility. The Company requested and obtained extensions effective on each of the facility first two anniversaries. Accordingly, effective
July26, 2007, the expiration date of the facility was extended to July24, 2012. On
June13, 2007, the Company entered into a letter amendment to the credit facility. As a result of this amendment, amounts outstanding under the credit facility are no longer
guaranteed by the Company principal U.S. operating subsidiaries. The release of the subsidiary guarantees under the credit facility resulted in the contractual release of subsidiary guarantees of
the Company senior notes and amounts outstanding under the ANZ facility. 
The
credit facility is available for general corporate purposes including the payment of a portion of the $5125million cash payment, plus accrued interest which was
$1584million at December31, 2007, required to be paid upon the effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the W. R. GraceCo. bankruptcy. The Company
may re-borrow amounts repaid under the credit facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the credit facility. Facility fees are payable at the rate of
0125% per annum on the total amounts available under the credit facility. The credit facility provides for changes in facility fees based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt
ratings. 
The
Company obligations under the credit facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The credit facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. The
terms include a requirement that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially
increase the Company liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under
the credit facility, or refinance the facility, within 60days. See Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs and Cryovac Transaction; Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction, of
Note16, Commitments and Contingencies, for further discussion. 
ANZ FacilityThe Company has an Australian dollar 1700million, dual-currency revolving credit facility
due March 2010, known as the ANZ facility, which was equivalent to U.S. $1460million at December31, 2007. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Company
Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes including refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ
facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. 
The
Company borrowed under the ANZ facility during the second quarter of 2006, but it repaid those amounts in full and did not borrow further under the ANZ facility during 2006 or during
2007. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December31, 2007 or at December31, 2006. The
Company obligations under the ANZ facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the
interbank rate for the relevant currency and time period. The ANZ facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.

In July 2003, the Company issued 3% convertible senior notes that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule144A and other available exemptions
under the Securities Act of 1933. 
Upon
issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, the holders had the right to convert those notes into shares of the Company common stock at a conversion rate of 142857 shares per
$1,000 principal amount of the notes, which was equivalent to a conversion price of $7000 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June30,
2033. In accordance with the anti-dilution provisions of the indenture governing the 3% convertible senior notes, as a result of the payment of quarterly dividends on the Company common
stock and the two-for-one common stock split in March 2007, at December31, 2007 the conversion rate had been adjusted to 293024 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
the notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $3413 per share. Holders may convert their convertible senior notes only under the following circumstances: 1during any calendar
quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days in the 30consecutive trading days ending on the last trading
day of the preceding calendar quarter; 2during any period in which ithe long-term credit rating assigned to the notes by Standard Poor Rating Services, a
division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, or Moody Investors Services,Inc. is lower than BB+ or Ba2, respectively, iieither Standard Poor or Moody no longer
rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or iiithe notes are not assigned a rating by both Standard Poor and Moody; 3during the five business day
period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the
closing sale price of the Company common stock and the conversion rate; 4if the notes have been called for redemption; or 5upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None
of these circumstances that would allow for conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since their issuance. The
Company has the option to redeem the 3% convertible senior notes beginning July2, 2007 at a price equal to 101286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to
100% of their aggregate principal amount on June30, 2010. 
The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes on June30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028,
or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Company common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Note11Debt and Credit Facilities Continued 5625% Euro Notes 
On July19, 2006, the Company 5625% euro notes with a face value of 2000million matured. The Company used available cash of
$2517million to retire this debt. Interest on the 5625% euro notes was payable annually in arrears, with the final payment of $142million made upon maturity of the euro notes. 
Covenants 
Each issue of the Company outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on the Company operations and those of specified subsidiaries. The principal
limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The credit facility contains financial covenants relating to interest coverage, debt leverage
and minimum liquidity and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and amendments to the asbestos
settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth and restrictions on the creation of liens, the
incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales, in each case relating to the Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries of the Company that are borrowers under the facility. The Company was in
compliance with the above financial covenants and limitations, as applicable, at December31, 2007 and 2006. Debt Maturities 
Scheduled annual maturities of the Company long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, exclusive of debt discounts
and the interest rate swap fair value adjustment, for the five years subsequent to December31, 2007 and thereafter are as follows: 2008 3059 2009 2423 20101 4360 2011 52 2012 03 Thereafter 8505 Total 1,8402 1This

2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028 as described above. Note12Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
The Company reports all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions
entered into for hedging purposes. 
The
Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the
Company enters into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge
accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The
Company assesses the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. The Company practice is to

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note12Derivatives and Hedging Activities Continued terminate
derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of
occurring. 
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
The Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure
from buying and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value
associated with the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 
The
Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $3851million maturing through October 2008 at December31, 2007 and
$3310million maturing through June 2007 at December31, 2006. The estimated fair values of these contracts, which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by
the Company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates, was a net payable of $05million at December31, 2007 and net receivable of
$01million at December31, 2006. These contracts qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges and had original maturities of less than twelve months. 
Interest Rate Swaps 
From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps to manage its mix of fixed and floating rates on its outstanding indebtedness. 
At
December31, 2007, the Company had outstanding interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $3000million that qualified and were designated as fair value
hedges. The Company entered into these interest rate swaps to effectively convert its 5375% senior notes due April 2008 into floating rate debt. The Company recorded a mark to market adjustment to
record a decrease of $21million at December31, 2007 and $89million at December31, 2006 in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due April 2008 due to changes in
interest rates and an offsetting increase to other current liabilities at December31, 2007 and other liabilities at December31, 2006 to record the fair value of the related interest
rate swaps. There was no ineffective portion of the hedges recognized in earnings during the period. 
In
2007 and 2006, under the terms of the $3000million outstanding interest rate swap agreements, the Company received interest at a fixed rate and paid interest at variable
rates that were based on the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. As a result, interest expense increased by $77million in 2007, $66million in 2006 and
$16million in 2005. 
In
2007, the Company terminated forward starting interest rate swaps. As a result, the company received cash of $37million related to this termination and recognized a gain for
this amount in other income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations. 
Other Derivative Instruments 
The Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest
rate and currency swaps related to access to additional sources of international financing. These instruments can potentially limit foreign exchange exposure and limit or adjust interest rate exposure
by swapping borrowings denominated in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no foreign exchange options or interest rate
and currency swap agreements outstanding.

Cash Flow Hedges 
The Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income, to the extent that these hedges are effective
and until it recognizes the underlying transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in other income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Other
comprehensive income reflected net unrealized after tax losses of $06million $10million pre-tax in 2007, $07million $11million
pre-tax in 2006 and $08million $12million pre-tax, in 2005. 
The
estimated net amount of the existing unrecognized net gain on derivative instruments that the Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations within the
next twelve months is $11million, pre-tax. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income loss will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during
each reporting period. The Company cash flow hedges for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 were effective hedges, meaning that they qualified for hedge accounting treatment. 
Note13Financial Instruments 
Under U.S.GAAP, the Company must disclose its estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments, including those recorded as assets or
liabilities in its consolidated financial statements and derivative financial instruments. 
The
following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: 1cash and cash equivalents, 2investments in
available-for-sale securities, 3receivables, net, 4certain other current assets, 5accounts payable and 6other current liabilities. The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and
liabilities, except for the Company available-for-sale investments. The carrying amounts of the Company available-for-sale investments were
determined based on quoted market prices. 
The
fair values of the Company senior notes at December31, 2007 and 2006 are based on quoted market prices. The Company derived the fair value estimates of the Company
various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the
balance sheet date. These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore the Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions
could significantly affect the Company estimates. 
The
fair value of the debt in the table below differs from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on market conditions as of December31, 2007 and 2006.
Generally, the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The
fair values of the Company various derivative instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to
terminate the contracts at the reporting date.

carrying value and fair value of such debt includes adjustments due to interest rate swaps. See Note12, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. Credit and Market Risk 
Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest
or currency exchange rates. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk. 
The
Company does not expect any of its counterparties in derivative transactions to fail to perform as they are substantial investment and commercial banks with high credit ratings and
financial strength and have significant experience using such derivative instruments. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the Company exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be
material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. The
Company monitors the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and
currency exchange rates and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative
purposes and does not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. 
The
Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its diverse base of customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business and generally does not require
collateral. The Company considers the concentrations of credit risk associated with its trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believes that such concentrations do not leave it
vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of the Company credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any
single customer. The Company sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans 
The Company has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees. Contributions to this plan, which are made at the
discretion of the Company board of directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of the Company common stock. The Company also
maintains a contributory thrift and retirement savings plan in which most of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and retirement savings plan generally provides for
Company contributions in cash based upon the amount contributed to the plan by the participants. Company contributions to or provisions for its profit-sharing plan and thrift and retirement savings
plan are charged to operations and amounted to $328million in 2007, $304million in 2006 and $300million in 2005. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 there were no shares of common stock
issued for the Company contribution to its profit-sharing plan. Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
On December31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of SFAS No158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158, as of December31, 2006. SFAS No158 requires, among
other things, the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan which is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations
of the employee benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Each over funded plan is recognized as an asset
and each under funded plan is recognized as a liability. The initial impact of the standard due to unrecognized prior service costs and net actuarial gains or losses, as well as subsequent changes in
the funded status, are recognized as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the line item unamortized pension liability that is included in total shareholders' equity. The amount of
unamortized pension liability is recorded net of tax. Additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets were also derecognized upon adoption of the new standard. The measurement
date used by the Company to determine the benefit obligations and the plan assets is December31. The
table below summarizes the incremental effects of SFAS No158 adoption on the individual line items in the Company consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2006: Pre-SFAS

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 
The Company generally does not offer its employees postretirement benefits other than programs that are required by the foreign countries in which the Company
operates. In the U.S., the Company offers a program that is fully funded by the participating retired employees. These programs are not material to the Company consolidated financial position or
results of operations. 
Since
March31, 1998, the Company has offered to some U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement
healthcare program. The accrued benefit liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $25million at December31, 2007 and 2006. The net periodic postretirement expense and
credit components, together with other remaining postretirement healthcare plan disclosures under SFAS No132, are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Note15Income Taxes

226 315 321 FIN48  In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN48. This interpretation addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax
return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN48, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the 
91 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data Note15Income Taxes Continued 
technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities. FIN48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in
interim periods and requires increased disclosures. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of FIN48 on January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN48, the Company recognized no change in the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits. At December31, 2007, the Company classified $81million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest in other liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet, which were previously classified as income taxes payable before the adoption of FIN48. 
As
required under FIN48, the Company is providing the following disclosures related to the unrecognized tax benefits and the effect, if any, on the effective income tax rate if
recognized. Gross
Net Unrecognized tax benefits at January1, 2007 1151 1006 Additions based on tax positions related to current year 24 17 Additions based on tax positions of prior years 15 14 Lapse of the applicable statute of limitations 306 291 Settlements 10 09 Change in tax rates 112 74 Unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007 762 663 If
the unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2007 were recognized, the Company income tax provision would be decreased by $663million, resulting in a substantially
lower effective tax rate. 
There
are no known tax positions reasonably possible to change over the next twelve months that would result in a material change in the Company unrecognized tax benefits. 
The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax provision on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company had a liability of
approximately $213million of which $17million represents penalties at January1, 2007 and a liability of $29million of which $11million represents
penalties at December31, 2007 for the payment of interest and penalties before any tax benefit. In 2007, interest of $192million gross $124million net was reversed
in connection with the related tax accruals for uncertainties for which the statute of limitations lapsed.  Income Tax Returns  In April 2007, the IRS commenced its examination of the Company income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006. Tax years 2003 and prior are closed for
Federal income tax purposes. 
State
income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after their filing date. The Company has various state income tax returns in the process
of examination. 
Income
tax returns in foreign jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years after their filing date. The income tax returns filed by the Company
major foreign entities are open to possible examination beginning with the year shown in parentheses in the following countries: Australia 2003, Brazil 2003, Canada 2004, France 2005, Germany
2003, Italy 2002, Malaysia 2001, Mexico 2003, Netherlands 2004, New Zealand 2002, Spain 2002, Switzerland 2007 and the UK 2005. The Company foreign income tax returns are under
examination in various jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business.

Note16Commitments and Contingencies 
Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs 
On November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the bankruptcy case of
W. R. GraceCo., known as Grace, to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction
described below. The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, successor liability claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc. and
affiliated companies, that had been made against the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Company Board of
Directors. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos-related
claims and the parties involved, see Cryovac Transaction and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction below. The
Company recorded a charge of $8501million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2002. The
charge consisted of the following items: a
non-cash charge of $5125million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of an
appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this liability as a current
liability on the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 55% annual rate from December21, 2002 to the date
of payment. The Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The accrued
interest, which is compounded annually, was $1584million and $1235million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
a
non-cash charge of $3215million representing the fair market value at the date the Company recorded the charge of nine million shares of the Company
common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Grace plan of reorganization, which was adjusted to eighteen million shares due to the
two-for-one stock split in March 2007. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends
and other events affecting the Company common stock. The fair market value of the Company common stock was $3572 per pre-split share as of the close of business on December5,
2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 as follows: $09million representing the aggregate par value of these shares in common
stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining $3206million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value over the aggregate par value of
these common shares, in additional paid-in capital. The diluted earnings per common share calculations for the three years ended December31, 2007 reflect the shares of common stock
reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.
$161million
of legal and related fees as of December31, 2002. Asbestos
settlement and related costs reflected legal and related fees for asbestos-related matters of $07million in 2007, $16million in 2006 and $22million in
2005, which are included in other, net, on the Company consolidated statements of operations. 
Cryovac Transaction 
On March31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air
Corporation business under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding 
93

Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note16Commitments and Contingencies Continued company.
As part of that transaction, the parties separated the Cryovac packaging business, which previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, from the
remaining businesses previously held by the Company. The parties then arranged for the contribution of these remaining businesses to a company now known as W. R. GraceCo., and the
Company distributed the Grace shares to the Company stockholders. As a result, W. R. GraceCo. became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding
shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into the former Sealed Air Corporation, which became a subsidiary of the
Company and changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation US. 
Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction 
In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac transaction,
whether accruing or occurring before or after the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities
relating to asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by Grace subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R.
GraceCo.Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction agreements provided that, should
any claimant seek to hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related liabilities, Grace and its
subsidiaries would indemnify and defend the Company. 
Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos
liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions and a number of
personal injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation
product. Neither the former Sealed Air Corporation nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has reached
resolution through judgment, settlement or otherwise. As discussed below, Grace Chapter11 bankruptcy proceeding has stayed all these cases. 
While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction was a
fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for
liabilities that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R. GraceCo.Conn. or other Grace subsidiaries. A transfer would be a
fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was engaged or was about to engage in a
business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature. A transfer may also be
fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be fraudulent transfers, the Company
could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their creditors, including asbestos
claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently signed a settlement agreement, described below, that is expected to resolve all these claims. In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief that
Grace and its subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction
would be a fraudulent transfer. They also 
94 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note16Commitments and Contingencies Continued stated
their belief that the Cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions adverse to the Company, these
determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position and results of operations. On
April2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the
District of Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999. 
In
connection with its Chapter11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified
subsidiaries related to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May3, 2001, which was modified on
January22, 2002, under which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the Company and, upon filing and service on the Company, all future asbestos actions. No further
proceedings involving the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
Committees
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in Grace bankruptcy case received the court permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its
subsidiary Cryovac,Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R.
GraceCo.Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March 2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction
and whether Grace received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all of Grace creditors. This proceeding was brought in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware Adv. No02-02210. 
In
June 2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that
environmental remediation expenses were underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted
that the Cryovac transaction was not a fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July 2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial, holding,
among other things, that, subject to specified limitations, post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace. The Company believes that only claims and liabilities
that were known, or reasonably should have been known, at the time of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable standard. 
With
the fraudulent transfer trial set to commence on December9, 2002, on November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting
the claims against the Company and Cryovac,Inc., to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order
confirming that the parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the parties and that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of
the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle called for payment of nine million shares of the Company common stock and $5125million in cash, plus interest on
the cash payment at a 55% annual rate starting on December21, 2002 and ending on the effective date of the Grace plan of reorganization, when the Company is required to make the payment.
These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock, and as a
result, the number of shares of the Company common stock to be paid increased to eighteen million shares upon the two-for-one stock split in March 2007. On December3,
2002, the Company Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle. The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5,
2002. The parties subsequently signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in

On November26, 2003, the parties jointly presented the definitive settlement agreement to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for approval. On Grace motion to the
U.S. District Court, that court transferred the motion to approve the settlement agreement to the Bankruptcy Court for disposition. 
On
June27, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court signed an order approving the definitive settlement agreement. Although Grace is not a party to the settlement agreement, under the terms of
the order, Grace is directed to comply with the settlement agreement subject to limited exceptions. The order also provides that the Court will retain jurisdiction of any dispute involving the
interpretation or enforcement of the terms and provisions of the definitive settlement agreement. The Company expects that the settlement agreement will become effective upon Grace emergence from
bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. 
On
June8, 2004, the Company filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, where the fraudulent transfer trial was pending, requesting that the court
vacate the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. The Company was not challenging the definitive settlement
agreement. The motion was filed as a protective measure in the event that the settlement agreement is ultimately not approved or implemented; however, the Company still expects that the settlement
agreement will become effective upon the court approval and Grace emergence from bankruptcy with a plan of reorganization that is consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. 
On
July11, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order closing the proceeding brought in 2002 by the committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the Grace bankruptcy
proceeding against the Company without prejudice to the Company right to reopen the matter and renew in its sole discretion its prior motion to vacate the July 2002 interim ruling on the legal
standards to be applied relating to the fraudulent transfer claims against the Company. 
As
a condition to the Company obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, any final plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement,
including provisions for the trusts and releases referred to below and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates. In that case,
the settlement will provide that, upon the effective date of the final plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against the Company and
its affiliates that arise from alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac transaction will be
channeled to and become the responsibility of one or more trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace plan of reorganization. The settlement will
also resolve all fraudulent transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement will provide
that the Company and its affiliates will receive releases of all those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from Grace for the Company payments required by the
settlement. The order approving the settlement agreement also provides that the stay of proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the effective date of the final plan of
reorganization, after which, upon implementation of the settlement agreement, the Company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against
the Company will be enjoined.

Note16Commitments and Contingencies Continued  In January 2005, Grace filed a proposed plan of reorganization the Grace Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. There were a number of objections filed. The Official
Committee of Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants and the Future Claimants' Representative filed their proposed plan of reorganization the Claimants' Plan with the Bankruptcy Court in November 2007.
Assuming that a final plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and does become effective, the Company does not know whether the final plan of reorganization will be consistent with
the terms of the settlement agreement or if the other conditions to the Company obligation to pay the settlement amount will be met. If these conditions are not satisfied or not waived by the
Company, the Company will not be obligated to pay the settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount, the Company and its affiliates will not be released from the
various asbestos-related, fraudulent transfer, successor liability claims, and indemnification claims made against them, and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved
through other means, such as through agreement on alternative settlement terms or trials. In that case, the Company could face liabilities that are significantly different from its obligations under
the settlement agreement. The Company cannot estimate at this time what those differences or their magnitude may be. In the event these liabilities are materially larger than the current existing
obligations, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict when a final plan of reorganization will become
effective or whether the final plan will be consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement. In
January 2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified
affiliates in New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities
that they might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties' contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and W. R.
GraceCo.Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February 2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they had accrued a charge of $1720million
for these potential liabilities, which included pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from Grace Chapter11 filing. The Company
believed that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under the 1996 agreements and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the Fresenius parties' claims. In April 2002, the
Fresenius parties filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of declaratory relief in its favor. The Company opposed the motion, and in July 2003, the court denied the motion without prejudice
in view of the November27, 2002 agreement in principle referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement, there will be mutual releases exchanged between the Fresenius parties
and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the 1996 Fresenius transaction. 
In
November 2004, the Company Canadian subsidiary Sealed Air CanadaCo./Cie learned that it had been named a defendant in the case of Thundersky v. The
Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No.CI04-01-39818, which is pending in the Manitoba Court of Queen Bench. Grace and W. R.
GraceCo.Conn. are also named as defendants. The claim is brought as a putative class proceeding and seeks recovery for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian resident,
other than in the course of employment, as a result of Grace marketing, selling, processing, manufacturing, distributing and/or delivering asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada prior to
the Cryovac Transaction. Another proceeding was filed in January 2005 in the Manitoba Court of The Queen Bench naming the Company and specified subsidiaries as defendants. The latter proceeding, Her Majesty the Queen in
Right of the Province of Manitoba v. The Attorney General of Canada, et al. File No. CI05-01-41069,
seeks the recovery of the cost of insured health services allegedly provided by the Government of Manitoba to the members of the class of plaintiffs in the Thundersky proceeding. In October 2005, the
Company learned that six additional putative class proceedings had been brought in various provincial and
federal courts in Canada seeking recovery from the Company and its subsidiaries Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air CanadaCo./Cie, as well as other defendants including W. R.
GraceCo. and W. R. GraceCo.Conn., for alleged injuries suffered by any Canadian

other than in the course of employment except with respect to one of these six claims, as a result of Grace marketing, selling, manufacturing, processing, distributing and/or delivering
asbestos or asbestos-containing products in Canada prior to the Cryovac Transaction. Grace and W. R. GraceCo.Conn. have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Company and its affiliates in respect of any liability and expense, including legal fees and costs, in these actions. In April 2001, Grace Canada,Inc. had obtained an order of the Superior
Court of Justice, Commercial List, Toronto, recognizing the Chapter11 actions in the United States of America involving Grace Canada,Inc. U.S. parent corporation and other affiliates
of Grace Canada,Inc., and enjoining all new actions and staying all current proceedings against Grace Canada,Inc. related to asbestos under the Companies'
Creditors Arrangement Act. That order has been renewed repeatedly. In November 2005, upon motion by Grace Canada,Inc., the court ordered an extension of the injunction
and stay to actions involving asbestos against the Company and its Canadian affiliate and the Attorney General of Canada, which had the effect of staying all of the Canadian actions referred to above.
Representative counsel for the plaintiffs have filed a motion in the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act proceeding to lift the stay and enable the
Canadian litigation to proceed in order to establish the validity and amount of their claims. The court has entered an order extending the stay until the date on which the relief sought by the
plaintiffs in their motion is either granted or denied by the court. The plaintiffs' motion is scheduled to be heard on March26, 2008. The proposed Grace Plan provides that these claims will
be paid by trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code and it is anticipated that the defendants will ask the Canadian courts to enforce the terms of the plan of
reorganization if it is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and becomes effective. However, assuming that a final plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and does become effective,
if the final plan of reorganization does not include comparable provisions or if the Canadian courts refuse to enforce the final plan of reorganization in the Canadian courts, and if in addition Grace
is unwilling or unable to defend and indemnify the Company and its subsidiaries in these cases, then the Company could be required to pay substantial damages, which the Company cannot estimate at this
time and which could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition and results of operations. 
In
view of Grace Chapter11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac
transaction and for which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. 
Final
determinations and accountings under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace
Chapter11 filing in 2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its affiliates
agreed to retain or that are subject to indemnification by
Grace and its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the Company is responsible for specified
amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the liabilities of Grace and its affiliates to the Company. The Company
intends to seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims, and approximately $81million
paid by the Company on account of its guaranty of debt issued by W. R. GraceCo.Conn. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim, the Company expects
that its claims will be as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Company claims against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated, the Company cannot determine the
amount of the Company claims, the extent to which these claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the amount of the Company recovery on these claims, if any, in
the bankruptcy proceeding. 
On
September15, 2003, the case of Senn v. Hickey, et al. Case No03-CV-4372 was filed in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey Newark. This lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of all 
98 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note16Commitments and Contingencies Continued persons
who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the Company during the period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002. The lawsuit named the Company and five current and
former officers and directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is required to provide indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Company counsel is also defending them. On
June29, 2004, the court granted plaintiff Miles Senn motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and for approval of his choice of lead counsel. The plaintiff amended complaint makes a number
of allegations against the defendants. The principal allegations are that during the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public, artificially inflated the price of the
Company common stock by publicly issuing false and misleading statements and violated U.S.GAAP by failing to properly account and accrue for the Company contingent liability for asbestos
claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The Company is vigorously defending the lawsuit, since the Company believes that it
properly disclosed its contingent liability for Grace asbestos claims and properly accounted for its contingent liability for such claims under U.S.GAAP. 
On
March14, 2005, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the Senn v. Hickey, et
al. case for failure to state a claim. On December19, 2005, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss. The Court determined that the
Complaint failed adequately to allege scienter as to the four individual defendants other than T.J. Dermot Dunphy, and therefore dismissed the lawsuit with respect to these four individual defendants,
but adequately alleged scienter as to Mr.Dunphy and the Company. Mr.Dunphy is a current director of the Company and was formerly Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company. On December28, 2005, the defendants requested that the Court reconsider the portion of the December19, 2005 order denying defendants' motion to dismiss with regard to the
Company arguments other than scienter, or, in the alternative, that the Court certify the matter for interlocutory appeal. On February13, 2006, the defendants filed an answer to the amended
complaint. On April7, 2006, the Court heard oral argument on defendants' reconsideration motion, and on July10, 2006, the Court denied the motion on the ground that issues of fact
prevent the Court from granting a motion to dismiss based on the Company arguments other than scienter. On October3, 2006, plaintiff filed a motion to certify a class of all persons who
purchased or otherwise acquired the securities of the Company during the period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002. On November22, 2006, plaintiff filed an amended motion
for class certification, seeking to withdraw as a class representative and to substitute a new class representative, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System MPERS. On
March26, 2007, the Court entered an order permitting Miles Senn to withdraw as lead plaintiff and permitting MPERS to be substituted as lead plaintiff. Consequently, the case is now properly
referred to as MPERS v. Sealed Air Corporation, et al. On March29, 2007, MPERS, as lead plaintiff, filed a motion to certify a class of all
persons or entities that purchased Sealed Air Corporation securities during the period from March27, 2000 through July30, 2002, both dates inclusive, and were
damaged thereby. On July25, 2007, the Company and Mr.Dunphy filed their memorandum of law in opposition to MPERS motion for class certification. On July25, 2007, the Company
and Mr.Dunphy also filed a motion for reconsideration or for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Supreme Court recent decisions in Tellabs,Inc. v. Makor
Issues Rights,Ltd., and Bell
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly require dismissal of MPERS claims. Both the class certification and reconsideration motions have
been fully briefed and the Company is awaiting decisions by the Court. Discovery is ongoing. Although the Company believes that neither it nor Mr.Dunphy should have any liability in this
lawsuit, until the lawsuit has progressed beyond its current stage, the Company cannot estimate the potential cost of an unfavorable outcome, if any.  Compliance Matters  In late 2005, the Company identified travel and related expenses that had been paid by some of the Company foreign subsidiaries for trips by government
officials who oversee the regulation of the Company medical products in a foreign country. Although these expenses were accurately recorded as travel and entertainment expenses in the Company
books and records, these activities appeared to have breached the 
99 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note16Commitments and Contingencies Continued Company
Code of Conduct. More importantly, the Company was concerned that these payments may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and therefore outside counsel was retained and promptly
began an internal investigation. In March 2006, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the United States Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or
the SEC, the factual information obtained to date in the Company internal investigation, including that these payments were made between 2003 and 2005 and totaled less than $02million. The
internal investigation is ongoing, and the Company is cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC. The Company cannot predict when this matter will be resolved or the terms upon which this matter will be
resolved, although the Company currently does not expect this matter to be material to its consolidated results of operations or financial position. In connection with the investigation, the Company
is evaluating remedial measures and is taking timely and appropriate action where necessary. 
Other Principal Contractual Obligations 
At December31, 2007, the Company had principal contractual obligations, which included agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw
materials, or services in the normal course of business, aggregating approximately $1786million. The estimated future cash outlays are as follows: Year 
Amount 2008 1150 2009 390 2010 135 2011 64 2012 47 Total 1786 Leases 
The Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller
manufacturing sites that it occupies. The Company accounts for the majority of its leases as operating leases, which may include purchase or renewal options. At December31, 2007 estimated
future minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable real and personal property leases were as follows: Year 
Amount 2008 288 2009 228 2010 184 2011 153 2012 120 Thereafter 280 Total 1253 Net
rental expense was $305million in 2007, $285million in 2006 and $283million in 2005. 
Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory
and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account 
100 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data 
Note16Commitments and Contingencies Continued any
discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of
the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever
circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated. 
The
Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions
with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided the outcomes of
which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures
are not material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. 
Note17Shareholders' Equity  Quarterly Cash Dividends  On February16, 2007, the Company Board of Directors increased the Company quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $020 per common share, declaring a
quarterly cash dividend payable on pre-split shares of the Company common stock on March16, 2007 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March2, 2007. 
During
the remaining three quarters of 2007, the Company declared and paid quarterly cash dividends on post-split shares of the Company common stock of $010 per common
share to stockholders of record at the close of business on June1, 2007, September7, 2007 and December7, 2007. The
Company used cash of $646million to pay the 2007 quarterly cash dividends. During 2006, the Company used cash of $486million to pay quarterly cash dividends of
$015 per common share. These payments were reflected as reductions to retained earnings on the Company consolidated balance sheets. 
On
February19, 2008, the Company Board of Directors increased the Company quarterly cash dividend by 200% to $012 per common share, declaring a quarterly cash dividend
payable on March21, 2008 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March7, 2008. The estimated amount of the dividend payment is approximately $194million based on
1616million shares of the Company common stock issued and outstanding as of January31, 2008.  Two-For-One Common Stock Split  On February16, 2007, the Company Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the Company common stock that was
effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was paid on March16, 2007 at the rate of one additional share of the Company common stock for each share of the Company common
stock issued and outstanding to stockholders of record at the close of business on March2, 2007. In addition, nine million additional shares of common stock were reserved for the asbestos
settlement. The stock dividend was not paid on treasury shares. The par value of the Company common stock remains at $010 per share. 
All
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split, except for shareholders' equity. See Note18, Net Earnings Per
Common Share, for the impact on the Company earnings per share amounts as a result of the stock split. This stock split resulted in the issuance of 808million additional shares of common
stock and was accounted for by the transfer of $81million from additional paid-in capital to common stock, which is the amount equal to the par value of the additional shares
issued to effect the stock split. In addition, nine million additional shares of common stock were reserved for the asbestos settlement and were accounted for by the transfer of $09million
from additional paid-in capital to common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.

2006 and 2005 information has not been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split in March 2007. Stock-Based Compensation 
In December 2004, the FASB, issued SFAS No123 revised, Share-Based Payment which replaced SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123 revised covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements and requires that the compensation cost related to these types of payment transactions be recognized in financial statements. Cost is measured based on the fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. The Company adopted SFAS No123 revised in the first quarter of 2006 as required using the modified prospective application. Under the modified
prospective application, SFAS No123 revised applies to all awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled by the Company since January1, 2006 and to unvested awards at the date
of adoption. The Company was also required to eliminate any unearned or deferred compensation related to earlier awards against the appropriate equity account. At December31, 2005, the Company
had $178million of deferred compensation recorded in the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. This amount was eliminated against additional paid-in
capital on January1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No123 revised did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations as the amounts
previously recognized by the Company for stock awards under the 1998 and 2005 Contingent Stock Plans are essentially the same as under SFAS No123.  Contingent Stock Plans  At the Company annual meeting of stockholders held on May20, 2005, the stockholders approved the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan of Sealed Air Corporation.
The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan replaced the contingent stock plan that was approved by the Company stockholders in 1998. The 2005 Contingent Stock Plan is the Company sole long-term
equity compensation program for officers and employees, except that prior grants under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan remained subject to that plan provisions. The 2005 
102 
SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Continued 
Amounts in tables in millions, except share and per share data Note17Shareholders' Equity Continued 
Contingent
Stock Plan provides for awards of equity-based compensation, including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and cash awards measured by share price, to
executive officers and other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as U.S.-based key consultants to the Company. During 2007, under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan, the Company had
granted restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards. An employee or consultant selected by the Organization and Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors to receive an
award may accept the award during the 60-day period beginning when written notice of the award has been sent to the participant, provided the participant relationship to the Company has
not changed. 
The
Company 1998 Contingent Stock Plan provided for the grant to employees of awards to purchase common stock during the succeeding 60-day period. The Organization and
Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors had set the price to purchase the common stock pursuant to the grants under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan at $100 pre-split per share,
subject to appropriate adjustments in the event of any stock dividend, split-up, recapitalization, merger, or other events affecting the Company common stock. There is no similar
purchase price under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan. 
Awards
made under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and shares issued under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan are restricted as to disposition by the holders for a period of at least three
years after award. In the event of termination of employment of a participant prior to lapse of the restriction, the awards under the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan are forfeited on the date of
termination unless ithe termination results from the participant death or permanent and total disability, or iithe Organization and Compensation Committee affirmatively
determines not to seek forfeiture of the award in whole or in part. Likewise, shares of restricted stock awarded under the 1998 Contingent Stock Plan were subject to a repurchase option by the Company
at the price at which the shares were issued, as adjusted for the March 2007 stock split. The forfeiture provision of the 2005 Contingent Stock Plan and the repurchase provision of the 1998 Contingent
Stock Plan expire upon vesting of the awards, except that these provisions lapse sooner if specified events occur that affect the existence or control of the Company. For
both restricted stock awards and units, the Company records compensation expense and credits additional paid-in capital within shareholders' equity based on the fair
value of the Company common stock at the award grant date. For cash awards, the Company records a liability, which is reflected in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, and records
compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period. The amount of the liability is re-measured at each reporting period based on the then current
stock price and the effects of the stock price changes are recognized as compensation expense. At December31, 2007, the liability related to cash awards was immaterial to the Company
consolidated balance sheet. The Company granted cash
awards measured by 11,650 shares of common stock in 2007. The Company has not settled any cash awards during 2007. 
Compensation
expense related to restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures in 2007 and 2006 under SFAS No123 revised
and net of actual forfeitures in 2005 under SFAS No123, over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. These charges are included in marketing, administrative and
development expenses and amounted to $165million in 2007, $140million in 2006 and $119million in 2005. 
At
December31, 2007, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding restricted stock was approximately 16years, restricted stock units was approximately
17years and cash awards was approximately 21years, and had terms expiring primarily up to 2010. At December31, 2007, the total compensation cost related to nonvested
restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash awards not yet recognized was $280million. At December31, 2007, there were 1,560,000 shares of nonvested restricted stock, 293,800
shares of nonvested restricted stock units and nonvested cash awards measured by 17,650 shares outstanding. At December31, 2006, there were 722,975pre-split shares of nonvested
restricted stock, 93,900pre-split shares of non vested restricted stock units and nonvested cash awards measured by

2006 and 2005 information has not been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split in March 2007.  Directors Stock Plan  Non-cash compensation included in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity comprises shares issued to non-employee directors in
the form of awards under the Company 2002 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan
provides for annual grants of shares to non-employee directors, and interim grants of shares to eligible directors elected at times
other than at an annual meeting, at a price per share equal to the par value of the shares, as all or part of the annual or interim retainer fees for non-employee directors. During 2002,
the Company adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer until the non-employee director retires from the Board.
The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock. If a non-employee director makes this election, the
non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if any, of the annual retainer payable in cash. Cash dividends on deferred shares are credited to the non-employee
director deferred cash account on the applicable dividend payment date. The Company charges the excess of fair value over the price at which shares are issued under this plan to operations. This
charge is included in marketing, administrative and development expenses and was $04million in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

2006 and 2005 information has not been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split in March 2007.  Other Common Stock Issuances  In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company issued 25,000 shares of its common stock under its 2005 Contingent Stock Plan to a U.S.-based non-employee
as compensation under a consulting agreement for research and development projects. These shares vest as follows: 15,000 shares in 2010, 5,000 shares in 2011 and 5,000 shares in 2012. 
In
2004, the Company issued 50,000 pre-split shares of its common stock to a non-employee under an intellectual property purchase agreement as prepaid royalties
under that agreement. These shares vest ratably over a five-year period. These shares were increased to 100,000 shares as a result of the two-for-one common stock
split in March 2007. 
The
Company amortizes the cost associated with these issuances on a straight-line basis based on each of the issuances' vesting schedule. Amortization expense related to
these issuances was $04million in 2007 and $05million for both 2006 and 2005.  Stock Options  Stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March31, 1998 in connection with
the Cryovac transaction, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the
date of grant. All options outstanding upon the termination of the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to December31, 2000. Since such options were fully vested, SFAS
No123 revised is not applicable. Since 1997, the Company has not issued any stock option awards and has no plans to do so in the future. At December31, 2007 there were no
outstanding options.

Note18Net Earnings Per Common Share Continued See
below for further discussion. The amounts previously reported, as revised to reflect the two-for-one stock split in 2007, were as follows: 2006
2005 Basic earnings per common share 169 154 Diluted earnings per common share 146 134 2All
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the two-for-one stock split as discussed in Note17, Shareholders' Equity. 
The
Company had previously included non-vested restricted stock in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in both its basic and diluted
earnings per share calculations. Also, the Company had previously excluded non-vested restricted stock units from the weighted average number of common shares outstanding in its basic
earnings per common share calculations, and from the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of its diluted earnings per common share calculations when inclusion of such units was
dilutive. 
The
earnings per common share calculations for 2006 and 2005 have been revised in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings Per Common Share, to include non-vested
restricted stock and non-vested restricted stock units only in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding of its diluted earnings per common share calculation, using the
treasury stock method, if the effect is dilutive. 
The
number of weighted average common shares outstanding in the revised 2006 and 2005 diluted earnings per common share calculations decreased from the amount that was previously
reported primarily due to the impact of the non-vested restricted stock now being accounted for under the treasury stock method. Previously, such shares were included in the basic and
diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding similar to the if-converted method. The impact of adding the non-vested restricted stock units under the treasury
stock method was dilutive in all revised periods and was also immaterial.  Diluted Weighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding  In calculating diluted earnings per common share, the diluted weighted average number of common shares provides for: 1the effect of conversion of the
Company 3% convertible senior notes due June 2033 due to the application of Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No04-08, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on
Diluted Earnings per Share, 2the effect of the assumed issuance of 18million shares of common stock reserved for the Company previously announced asbestos settlement referred to
in Note16, Commitments and Contingencies, under the caption Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs, 3the effect of the exercise of dilutive stock options, net of assumed treasury
stock repurchases, and 4the effect of non-vested restricted stock and non-vested restricted stock units using the treasury stock method, if their inclusion is
dilutive.

November 2007, the Company also acquired certain assets relating to polyethylene foam product lines located primarily in North America and Europe. 
The
Pack-Tiger and Alga Plastics acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and resulted in an allocation of goodwill of $146million. The allocation
of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was performed using estimated fair values. The allocation of the purchase price for the Alga Plastics acquisition is subject to
revisions based on the results of the final determination of estimated fair values, which are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. See Allocation of Goodwill to
Reportable Segments, of Note3, Business Segment Information, for discussion of goodwill by business segment.

Note21Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 
In
September 2006, the SEC released SAB108, which provides guidance on how to evaluate prior period financial statement misstatements for purposes of assessing their materiality
in the current period. There are two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements: the rollover or income statement method and the iron curtain or
balance sheet method. Historically, the Company used the rollover method. Under this method, the Company quantified its financial statement misstatements based on the amount of errors originating in
the current-year income statement and as a result did not consider the effects of correcting the portion of the current-year balance sheet misstatement that originated in prior
years. SAB108 now requires that the Company must consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods dual method when quantifying misstatements in the financial statements. The iron
curtain method quantifies a misstatement based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year, irrespective of the misstatement
origination. Upon application, SAB108 permits the Company to adjust for the cumulative effect of errors that were previously considered immaterial under the rollover method that are now
considered material under the dual method. The SAB108 adjustment affects the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of January1, 2006, with an offsetting adjustment to the
opening balance of retained earnings on January1, 2006. 
In
accordance with SAB108, the Company has adjusted its opening retained earnings balance for 2006 for the items described below. These errors had previously been considered
immaterial to the Company consolidated financial position and results of operations using the rollover method.  Capitalization of Overhead in Inventories  The Company adjusted its beginning retained earnings balance for 2006 to reflect the capitalization of certain manufacturing-related overhead costs in
inventories. These costs were previously expensed as incurred for a number of years, and this error existed prior to the Cryovac transaction in 1998. As a result of this adjustment, the Company
recorded an increase of $406million to inventory and a corresponding increase to retained earnings, before income taxes. The Cryovac transaction is discussed in Note16, Commitments
and Contingencies.  General Inventory Reserve  In 1998, the Company recorded a $60million inventory reserve with a corresponding charge to cost of sales to properly state inventory at net realizable
value and to recognize exposures regarding the valuation of inventories that the Company believed existed at the time. This reserve represented a write-down of inventories and created a
new cost basis for the related inventories. The Company did not write-off the reserve when the related inventories were disposed of, which primarily occurred in 1999 and 2000. The Company
maintained this reserve on its consolidated balance sheet through December31, 2005. This amount was reversed under the provisions of SAB108, which resulted in an increase to
inventories of $60million and a corresponding increase, before income taxes, to retained earnings as of January1, 2006.

Note21Recent Accounting Pronouncements Continued  Equipment Depreciation  The Company adjusted its beginning retained earnings balance for 2006 for a historical misstatement related to the use of incorrect useful lives for the
depreciation of certain equipment. This adjustment accumulated over several years and resulted in an increase to accumulated depreciation of $44million and a corresponding reduction, before
income taxes, to retained earnings.  Tax Valuation Allowance  The Company adjusted its beginning retained earnings balance for 2006 for a historical misstatement related to income tax valuation allowances that exceeded the
net deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions, which accumulated over a period of several years. These excess valuation allowances were reversed under SAB No108, which resulted in an
increase to deferred tax assets of $30million and a corresponding increase to retained earnings.  Impact of Adjustments  The impact of each of the items noted above on 2006 opening retained earnings is presented below. Inventory

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157 clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value, and expands the disclosures on fair
value measurements. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. However, on December14, 2007, the FASB issued proposed FASB Staff Position
157-b, which would delay the effective date of SFAS No157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually. The proposed FSP partially defers the effective date of SFAS No157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008,
and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this FSP. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No157 on its consolidated
financial statements. 
SFAS159 
In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159 provides companies with an option to
report selected financial assets 
111

Note21Recent Accounting Pronouncements Continued and
liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar
types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of
SFAS No159 on its consolidated financial statements. 
SFAS141R 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations. SFAS No141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes
and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, including goodwill, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. SFAS
No141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No141R is
effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. The impact of
adopting SFAS No141R will be dependent on the future business combinations that the Company may pursue after its effective date. SFAS160 
Also
in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
No51. SFAS No160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. SFAS No160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners.
This statement is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
December15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No160 on its consolidated financial statements.

13 Item4.Controls and Procedures     Disclosure Controls and Procedures  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that the Company employees accumulate this information and communicate it to the Company management,
including its Chief Executive Officer its principal executive officer and its Chief Financial Officer its principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the
required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide
only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls
and procedures.  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company
disclosure controls and procedures under Rule13a-15. The Company management, including the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, supervised and
participated in this evaluation. Based upon that evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.  Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  The Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. The management of the Company evaluated, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness,
as of the end of its 2007 fiscal year, of the Company internal control over financial reporting. The suitable recognized control framework on which management evaluation of the Company internal
control over financial reporting is based is the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO. Based
upon that evaluation under the COSO framework, the Company management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its 2007 fiscal year was effective. The Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by KPMGLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included in
this Annual Report on Form10-K, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There has not been any change in the Company internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2007 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting.
