REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Tenneco Automotive Inc.   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tenneco Automotive Inc.
a Delaware corporation and consolidated subsidiaries see Note 1 as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of income, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive income for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements and the
schedule referred to below are the responsibility of Tenneco Automotive Inc.
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1999 Tenneco
Automotive Inc. changed its methods of accounting for the costs of start-up
activities and for customer acquisition costs.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule of Tenneco
Automotive Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries is presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. The supplemental schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
of Tenneco Automotive Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole.

TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation and Presentation
Tenneco Automotive Inc. was known as Tenneco Inc. before the spin-off on
November 4, 1999, of our packaging business to our shareholders, as described in
Note 3. In these notes, when we discuss Tenneco we mean Tenneco Inc. and its
subsidiaries before the spin-off and Tenneco Automotive Inc. and its
subsidiaries after the spin-off.
Our financial statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. We carry
investments in 20% to 50% owned companies at cost plus equity in undistributed
earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative translation adjustments.
We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions.
In the first quarter of 2000 we changed how we record pass through sales
of some catalytic converter components. Pass through sales occur when we
purchase these components from suppliers, use the components in our
manufacturing process and sell the components to our customers as part of the
completed catalytic converter. In the past, we recorded pass through sales as
a reduction of cost of sales. We now record them as part of net sales.
Relationships with customers have begun to change where we now take title to
these components in the manufacturing process. Additionally, we believe that our
competitors in the automotive parts industry already follow this practice so
this change is consistent with industry practice and will permit improved
comparability with these companies. As a result of the change, our sales
increased $206 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, with no
impact on our earnings before interest and taxes. Had these components been
recorded on a comparable basis in the twelve months ended December 31, 1999 and
1998, net sales would have been $140 million and $72 million higher,
respectively.
Sales of Accounts Receivable
We entered into an agreement during 2000 to sell an interest in some of our
trade accounts receivable to a third party. We recognized a loss of $1 million
on these sales of trade accounts receivable during 2000, representing the
discount from book values at which these receivables were sold to the third
party. The discount rate varies based on funding cost incurred by the third
party, and it averaged 75% during the time period in 2000 when we sold
receivables. We retained ownership of the remaining interest in the pool of
receivables not sold to the third party. We valued this retained interest based
on the recoverable value of the receivables pool, which approximated book value.
Inventories
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, inventory by major classification was as
follows                                2000  1999

Work in   83   86

Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. A portion
of total inventories 29% and 30% at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively
is valued using the last-in, first-out method. If we had used the first-in,
first-out FIFO method of accounting for these inventories, they would have
been $16 million and $21 million higher at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. We value all other inventories using the FIFO or average cost
methods at the lower of cost or market value.

amortization, by major category were as follows                                 2000  1999
MILLIONS
$458  $485
Other intangible     5   10
$463  $495
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 15 to 40 years. Goodwill amortization amounted to $17 million in both 2000
and 1999, and $16 million in 1998, and is included in the statements of income
caption Depreciation and amortization.
We have capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily trademarks and
patents, based on their estimated fair value at the date we acquired them. We
amortize these intangible assets on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from five to 30 years. Amortization of intangibles amounted to $3 million in
both 2000 and 1999, and $2 million in 1998, and is included in the statements of
income caption Depreciation and amortization.
Plant, Property, and Equipment, at Cost
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, plant, property, and equipment, at cost, by
major category were as follows                                2000   1999
MILLIONS
Land, buildings, and  $ 312  $ 365
Machinery and   1,340  1,339
Other, including construction in progress.   200   219
$1,852  $1,923
We depreciate these properties on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Useful lives range from 10 to 40 years for buildings
and improvements and from three to 25 years for machinery and equipment.
Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Short and long-term notes receivable outstanding were $34 million and $26
million at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the allowance for doubtful accounts on
short- and long-term accounts and notes receivable was $24 million and $29
million, respectively.
Other Long-Term Assets
Beginning on January 1, 1999, we began expensing pre-production design and
development costs as incurred unless we have a contractual guarantee for
reimbursement from the original equipment customer. We had long-term receivables
of $15 million and $10 million on the balance sheet at December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively, for guaranteed pre-production design and development
reimbursement arrangements with our customers. In addition, property, plant and
equipment includes $41 million and $56 million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, for original equipment tools and dies that we own, and
55

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
prepayments and other includes $27 million and $25 million at December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively, for in-process tools and dies that we are building for
our original equipment customers. You should also read Changes in Accounting
Principles later in this note for more information.
We capitalize certain costs related to the purchase and development of
software that we use in our business operations. We amortize the costs
attributable to these software systems over their estimated useful lives,
ranging from three to 12 years, based on various factors such as the effects of
obsolescence, technology, and other economic factors. Capitalized software
development costs, net of amortization, were $98 million and $73 million at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Income Taxes
We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby we
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in our financial statements. We reduce deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance when, based upon our estimates, it is more likely than not
that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax assets in a future
period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances.
We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries as our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in
our foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries are
approximately $520 million at December 31, 2000. It is not practicable to
determine the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be payable upon remittance
of the assets that represent those earnings.
Earnings Per Share
We compute basic earnings per share by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic
earnings per share, except that we adjust the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding to include estimates of additional shares that would be issued if
potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. In addition, we adjust
income available to common shareholders to include any changes in income or loss
that would result from the assumed issuance of the dilutive common shares.
Allocation of Corporate Debt and Interest Expense
Our practice is to incur indebtedness for our consolidated group at the
parent company level or at a limited number of subsidiaries, rather than at the
operating company level, and to centrally manage various cash functions.
Consequently, our corporate debt has been allocated to discontinued operations
based upon the ratio of the discontinued operations' net assets to our
consolidated net assets plus debt. We have allocated interest expense, net of
tax, to our discontinued operations based on the same allocation methodology.
You should also read Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Loss,
for more information.
Research and Development
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. Research
and development expenses were $33 million, $32 million, and $30 million for
2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, and are included in the income statement
caption Engineering, research, and development expenses.

Foreign Currency Translation
We translate financial statements of international operations into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and
liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for each applicable period
for revenues, expenses, and gains and losses. We reflect translation adjustments
in the balance sheet caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
Risk Management Activities
We use derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency
forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rate
swaps to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates. Our primary exposure
to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans made
between affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third parties. Net
gains or losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated
as hedges are recognized in the income statement to offset the foreign currency
gain or loss on the underlying transaction. Additionally, we enter into foreign
currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes
in exchange rates on some intercompany and third party trade receivables and
payables. Since these anticipated transactions are not firm commitments, we mark
these forward contracts to market each period and record any gain or loss in the
income statement. From time to time we have also entered into forward contracts
to hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries. We recognize the after-tax
net gains or losses on these contracts on the accrual basis in the balance sheet
caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. In the statement of
cash flows, cash receipts or payments related to these exchange contracts are
classified consistent with the cash flows from the transaction being hedged.
We do not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Changes in Accounting Principles
In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, which establishes
new accounting and reporting standards for the costs of computer software
developed or obtained for internal use. This statement required prospective
application for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. We adopted SOP
98-1 on January 1, 1999. The impact of this new standard did not have a
significant effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In April 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities, which requires costs of start-up activities to be expensed
as incurred. This statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. The statement requires previously capitalized costs related
to start-up activities to be expensed as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle when the statement is adopted. Prior to January 1, 1999, we
capitalized certain costs related to start-up activities, primarily
pre-production design and development costs for new automobile original
equipment platforms. We adopted SOP 98-5 on January 1, 1999, and recorded an
after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle of $102 million net of a $50 million tax benefit, or $304 per
diluted common share. The change in accounting principle decreased income from
continuing operations by $19 million net of an $11 million tax benefit, or
$56 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 1999. If the new
accounting method had been applied retroactively, income from continuing
operations for the year ended December 31, 1998 would have been lower by $19
million net of a $12 million tax benefit, or $57 per diluted common share.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
57
64
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Activities. This statement establishes new accounting and reporting standards
requiring that all derivative instruments, including derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability measured at its fair value. The statement requires that changes in
the derivative fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement and requires that a company must formally document,
designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting treatment. This statement cannot be applied retroactively and is
effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We will begin
applying the new standard in the first quarter of 2001. We have completed a
review of our use of derivatives, including derivatives embedded in other
contracts. The adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on
our financial position or results of operations.
Effective January 1, 1999, we changed our method of accounting for customer
acquisition costs from a deferral method to an expense-as-incurred method. In
connection with the decision to separate the automotive and specialty packaging
businesses into independent public companies, we determined that a change to an
expense-as-incurred method of accounting for automotive aftermarket customer
acquisition costs was preferable in order to permit improved comparability of
stand-alone financial results with our aftermarket industry competitors. We
recorded an after-tax charge for the cumulative effect of this change in
accounting principle of $32 million net of a $22 million tax benefit, or $95
per diluted common share. The change in accounting principle increased income
from continuing operations by $10 million net of $6 million in income tax
expense, or $30 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31,
1999. If the new accounting principle had been applied retroactively, income
from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 1998 would have been
lower by $4 million net of a $3 million income tax benefit, or $11 per
diluted common share.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition. This SAB
provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of revenue in
the financial statements and is effective no later than the fourth quarter of
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1999. The SAB draws on the existing
accounting rules and defines the basic criteria that must be met before we can
record revenue. The impact of adopting SAB 101 did not have a significant effect
on our results of operations or financial position.
In May 2000, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives. This
issue addresses the recognition, measurement, and income statement
classification of various types of sales incentives, including discounts,
coupons, rebates, and free products. Beginning January 1, 2001, we will classify
some incentives that were previously shown in selling, general and
administrative expense as a reduction in revenues. If we had made this
reclassification for 2000 and 1999, net sales would have been reduced by
approximately $27 million and $21 million, respectively, with an offsetting
reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses.
During 2000, the EITF also reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-10,
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. This issue requires any
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling be classified as sales and
precludes the recording of shipping and handling costs as deductions from sales.
We record shipping and handling fees and costs in cost of goods sold. When we
implemented this consensus, its impact was not material to our results of
operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported
58
65
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Prior years' financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate
to conform to 2000 presentations.
2. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
We adopted plans to restructure portions of our operations in 1998, 1999
and 2000. In the fourth quarter of 1998, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan designed to reduce administrative and operational overhead
costs. We recorded a pre-tax charge to income from continuing operations of $53
million, $34 million after-tax, or $102 per diluted common share. Of the
pre-tax charge, for operational restructuring plans, $36 million related to the
consolidation of the manufacturing and distribution operations of our North
American aftermarket business. A staff and related cost reduction plan, which
covered employees in both the operating units and corporate operations, cost $17
million.
Our aftermarket restructuring involved closing two plant locations and five
distribution centers, resulting in eliminating 302 positions. Our staff and
related cost reduction plan involved eliminating 454 administrative positions.
We wrote down the fixed assets at the locations to be closed to their fair
value, less costs to sell, in the fourth quarter of 1998. As a result of the
single-purpose nature of the assets, we estimated fair value at scrap value less
cost to dispose. We did not receive any significant net cash proceeds from the
disposal of these assets. The effect of suspending depreciation for these
impaired assets is a reduction in depreciation and amortization of approximately
$2 million on an annual basis. We completed the 1998 restructuring actions in
the third quarter of 2000.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan designed to further reduce operational overhead costs. We
recorded a pre-tax charge to income from continuing operations of $55 million 50 million after-tax, or $150 per diluted common share. The charge includes
$37 million recorded in Europe to close a ride control manufacturing facility
and an exhaust just-in-time plant, close or downsize four aftermarket
distribution centers, and reduce administrative overhead by reducing management
employment; $15 million to close a North American exhaust manufacturing
facility; and $3 million for employment reductions in South America and Asia. In
total, the plan involves eliminating approximately 780 positions. We wrote down
the fixed assets at the locations to be closed to their fair value, less costs
to sell, in the fourth quarter of 1999. We estimated the fair value for
buildings using external real estate valuations or a review of recent sales
prices for like buildings in the area surrounding the plant to be closed. As a
result of the single-purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be
disposed of, fair value was estimated at scrap value less cost to dispose in
most cases. For certain machines that have value in the used equipment market,
engineers estimated value based on recent sales of like machines. We expect to
receive net cash proceeds of approximately $11 million when we dispose of these
assets. The effect of suspending depreciation for these impaired assets is a
reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $3 million
on an annual basis. We expect to complete all restructuring activities for the
1999 plan by the middle of 2001.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, our Board of Directors approved a
restructuring plan to reduce administrative and operational overhead costs. We
recorded a pre-tax charge to income from continuing operations of $46 million 32 million after tax, or $92 per diluted share. The charge is comprised of $24
million of severance and related costs for salaried employment reductions
worldwide and $22 million for the reduction of manufacturing and distribution
capacity in response to long term market trends. The manufacturing locations
involved are located in Europe, North America, and Asia. In total, the plan
involves the elimination of about 700 positions. We wrote down the assets at the
locations to be closed to
59
66
TENNECO AUTOMOTIVE INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
their fair value, less costs to sell in the fourth quarter of 2000. We estimated
the fair market value of buildings using external real estate appraisals. As a
result of the single purpose nature of the machinery and equipment to be
disposed of, fair value was estimated to be scrap value less costs to dispose in
most cases. We do not expect that net cash proceeds on the sale of these assets
will be significant. We expect to complete all restructuring activities related
to the 2000 plan by the end of 2001.
In addition to this restructuring charge, we also recorded other charges in
the fourth quarter of $15 million, $10 million after tax, or $29 per diluted
share. These charges relate to a strategic decision to reduce some of the
aftermarket parts we offer and to relocation expenses incurred associated with
the restructuring plan. The aftermarket parts were written down to their
estimated scrap value less costs to sell.
Amounts related to our restructuring plans, including the plans we
initiated in 1999 and 1998, are shown in the following table.                  DECEMBER 31, 1999    2000      2000   CHARGED TO  DECEMBER 31, 2000

Background of the Spin-off Transaction
In July 1998, the Board of Directors authorized management to develop a
broad range of strategic alternatives to separate the automotive, paperboard
packaging, and specialty packaging businesses. Subsequently, we completed the
following actions   - In January 1999, we announced an agreement to contribute the
containerboard business to a new joint venture with an affiliate of
Madison Dearborn Partners. The proceeds from the transaction, including
debt assumed by the new joint venture, were approximately $2 billion. The
transaction closed in April 1999. We retained a 43 percent interest in
the joint venture.
- In April 1999, we announced an agreement to sell our folding carton
operations to Caraustar Industries. This transaction closed in June 1999.
The folding carton operations and the containerboard business together
represented our paperboard packaging operating segment.
- On November 4, 1999, we completed the spin-off of the common stock of
Tenneco Packaging Inc., now known as Pactiv Corporation, to our
shareholders. Pactiv included all of the businesses that made up our
specialty packaging segment, as well as our remaining interest in the
containerboard joint venture and our administrative services operations.
As a result of this series of transactions, our former specialty and
paperboard packaging operating segments are presented as discontinued operations
in the accompanying financial statements.
The morning following the spin-off, we completed a reverse stock split that
had been approved by our shareholders in a special meeting held in October 1999.
As a result, every five shares of our common stock were converted into one share
of our new common stock.
Before the spin-off, we realigned substantially all of our existing debt
through a combination of tender offers, exchange offers, and other refinancings.

Discontinued Operations
Our loss from discontinued operations in 1999 was $208 million, comprised
principally of an after-tax loss on sale of the paperboard packaging business of
$207 million. This loss on sale includes a $54 million net loss in the fourth
quarter, reflecting events that occurred subsequent to the April 1999 sale
related to the final settlement of working capital amounts, revisions to
actuarially-determined estimates of pension plan effects, and changes in
estimates regarding liabilities retained by Pactiv.

Extraordinary Loss
During 2000, we recognized extraordinary losses of $1 million net of a $1
million income tax benefit, or $02 per diluted common share, related to the
early retirement of a portion of our long-term debt.
During 1999, an extraordinary loss of approximately $7 million net of a $3
million income tax benefit, or $21 per diluted common share, was recognized
due to the early retirement of debt. As a result of the debt realignment prior
to the spin-off, we recognized an extraordinary loss of approximately $11
million net of a $7 million income tax benefit, or $33 per diluted common
share. This extraordinary loss consists principally of the fair value paid in
the cash tender offers in excess of the historical carrying value for the debt
tendered.

Finally, we retired approximately $400 million of subsidiary preferred stock.
These transactions were financed by borrowings under our new credit facility,
senior subordinated debt that we issued, and borrowings by Pactiv under new
credit facilities. The debt of Pactiv was rated investment grade and our debt
was rated non-investment grade by debt rating agencies.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
As part of the debt realignment, on September 30, 1999, we entered into a
$155 billion committed senior secured financing arrangement with a syndicate of
banks and other financial institutions. On October 20, 2000, we entered into an
agreement to amend this facility to: i relax the financial covenant ratios
beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000, ii exclude up to $80 million of cash
charges and expenses related to cost reduction initiatives from the calculation
of EBITDA for our financial ratios through 2001 and, iii make certain other
technical changes. In exchange for these amendments, we agreed to certain
interest rate increases, lowered our capital expenditure limits and paid an
aggregate fee of about $3 million. The remainder of this discussion describes
the senior secured credit facility, as amended.
As a result of significant reductions in North American vehicle production
levels announced by our original equipment customers since late in the fourth
quarter of last year and further weakening of the global aftermarket, a trend
that accelerated late in the fourth quarter of last year as well, we entered
into a second amendment of our senior credit facility on March 22, 2001. The
second amendment revised the financial covenant ratios we are required to
maintain for each of the fiscal quarters ending in 2001. The second amendment
also reduced the limitation on 2001 capital expenditures from $225 million to
$150 million, and required that net cash proceeds from all significant,
non-ordinary course asset sales be used to prepay the senior term loans. In
exchange for these amendments, we agreed to a 25 basis point increase in
interest rates on the senior term loans and our revolving credit facility and
paid an aggregate fee of about $3 million to consenting lenders. The amendment
also provides for the continued availability of the full amount of our $500
million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2000, we had $454 million
available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility. Based on our
current projections, we believe that we will be able to meet these revised
financial covenant ratios and capital expenditure requirements.
Our ability to meet our financial covenants in 2001 and beyond depends upon
a number of operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our
control. Factors that could impact our compliance with our financial covenants
include the rate at which consumers continue to buy new vehicles and the rate at
which they continue to repair vehicles already in service. Persistently lower
North American vehicle production levels, further weakening in the global
aftermarket beyond our expectation, or an unanticipated reduction in vehicle
production levels in Europe, could impact our ability to meet our financial
covenant ratios. In the event that we are unable to meet these revised financial
covenants, we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs. These
options could include further renegotiations with our senior lenders, additional
cost reduction or restructuring initiatives, sales of assets or capital stock,
or other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position.
The remainder of this discussion describes the senior secured credit
facility, as amended on March 22, 2001.
The senior secured credit facility consists of: i a $500 million
revolving credit facility having a final maturity date of November 4, 2005; ii
a $406 million term loan having a final maturity date of November 4, 2005; iii
a $270 million term loan having a final maturity date of November 4, 2007 and;
iv a $270 million term loan having a final maturity date of May 4, 2008. A
portion of each term loan is payable in quarterly installments beginning
September 30, 2001. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at an annual
rate equal to, at the borrower option, either i the London Interbank
Offering Rate plus a margin of 325 basis points for the six-year revolving
credit facility and the six-year term loan, 375 basis points for the eight-year
term loan and 400 basis points for the eight-and-one-half year term loan; or
ii a rate consisting of the greater of JP Morgan Chase prime rate or the
Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points, plus a margin of 225 basis points for
the six-year revolving credit facility and the six-year term loan, 275 basis
points for the eight-year term loan and 300 basis points for the
eight-and-one-half year term loan. Under the provisions of the senior credit
facility agreement, the interest margins for borrowings under the revolving
credit facility and the six-year term loan may be adjusted based on our
consolidated leverage ratio total debt divided by consolidated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and

amortization EBITDA as defined in the senior credit facility agreement
measured at the end of each quarter.
The amended senior credit facility requires that we maintain the following
consolidated leverage ratios consolidated indebtedness divided by consolidated
EBITDA, consolidated interest coverage ratios consolidated EBITDA divided by
consolidated cash interest paid, and fixed charge coverage ratios consolidated
EBITDA less consolidated capital expenditures, divided by consolidated cash
interest paid.                                   QUARTER ENDING

a incurring additional liens; b sale and leaseback transactions; c
liquidations and dissolutions; d incurring additional indebtedness or
guarantees; e capital expenditures; f dividends, g mergers and
consolidations; and h prepayments and modifications of subordinated and other
debt instruments. Compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a
condition for any incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility
agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require
repayment of any outstanding loans. At December 31, 2000, we were in compliance
with these requirements.
On October 14, 1999, we issued $500 million of 11 5/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 2009. The senior subordinated debt indenture requires that we, as a
condition to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted,
initially maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 200. Under the
terms of the indenture, the minimum interest coverage ratio increases to 225
beginning on October 15, 2001. The indenture also contains restrictions on our
operations, including limitations on: 1 incurring additional indebtedness or
liens; 2 dividends, 3 distributions and stock repurchases; 4 investments;
and 5 mergers and consolidations. All of our existing and future material
domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee these
notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the
ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make
distributions to us.

with respect to letters of credit and other guarantees supporting various
financing and operating activities.
As of the spin-off, all of our then existing and future material domestic
wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior
secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes on a joint and several
basis. You should also read Note 13 where we present the Supplemental Guarantor

Interest Rate Swaps -- Under the terms of our senior credit facility
agreement, we hedged our exposure to floating interest rates by entering into
floating to fixed interest rate swaps covering $300 million of our floating rate
debt. The cost of replacing these contracts in the event of non-performance by
the counterparties would not be material.

tax loss carryforwards that are available to reduce future foreign tax
liabilities.
The $440 million of U.S. tax loss carryforwards that exist at December 31,
2000, expire beginning in 2019. The $220 million of state tax loss carryforwards
that exist at December 31, 2000, will expire in varying amounts over the period
from 2001 to 2020. Of the $185 million of foreign tax loss carryforwards that
exist at December 31, 2000, $163 million do not expire and the remainder expires
in varying amounts over the period from 2001 to 2010.
We have tax sharing agreements with our former affiliates that allocate tax
liabilities for prior periods.
7. COMMON STOCK
On October 25, 1999, our shareholders approved a reverse stock split
whereby every five shares of our common stock were converted into one share of
our new common stock on the day following the spin-off of Pactiv. In addition,
the stock options outstanding on the date of the spin-off were adjusted such
that employees received options only in the company for which they worked. The
number of shares subject to these options, as well as their exercise prices,
were adjusted so that the options immediately after the spin-off had equivalent
economic terms to the options immediately before the spin-off. Also, on the date
of the spin-off, all restricted stock and units and all performance shares then
outstanding were fully vested. All share prices and amounts, prior to November
5, 1999, in this note, with the exception of the earnings per share table, are
presented before the effect of the spin-off and reverse stock split.
We have authorized 135 million shares $01 par value of common stock, of
which 37,797,256 shares and 34,970,485 shares were issued at December 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively. We held 1,298,498 shares of treasury stock at December
31, 2000 and 1,298,373 shares at December 31, 1999.

Stock Plans
Tenneco Automotive Inc. Stock Ownership Plan -- In December 1996, we
adopted the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which permits the granting of a variety
of awards, including common stock, restricted stock, performance units, stock
appreciation rights SARs, and stock options to our directors, officers, and
employees. The plan, which will terminate December 31, 2001, was renamed the
Tenneco Automotive Inc. Stock Ownership Plan in connection with the spin-off.
We can issue up to 94 million shares of common stock under the Stock Ownership
Plan after adjusting for the spin-off and reverse stock split. In December 1999,
we adopted the Tenneco Automotive Inc. Supplemental Stock Ownership Plan, which
permits the granting of a variety of similar awards to our directors, officers
and employees. We can issue up to about 11 million treasury shares under the
Supplemental Stock Ownership Plan.
Restricted Stock/Units, Performance Units, and Stock Equivalent Units -- We
have granted restricted stock and restricted units to certain key employees.
These awards generally require, among other things, that the employee remains
our employee during the restriction period. We have also granted performance
units to certain key employees that are payable in common stock at the end of
three years after the date of grant based on the attainment of specified
performance goals for the three years. We have also granted stock equivalent
units to certain key employees that are payable in cash annually at the then
current market price of our common stock based on the attainment of specified
performance goals. During 2000, 1999, and 1998, we granted 2,735,174, 2,705,107,
and 640,810 shares and units, respectively, with a weighted average fair value
based on the price of our common stock on the grant date of $846, $856, and
$3803 per share, respectively. At December 31, 2000, 283,770 restricted shares
at an average price of $833 per share, 467,416 performance units at an average
price of $848 per share, 39,076 restricted units at an average price of $856
per unit, and 1,944,912 stock equivalent units at an average price of $848 per
unit were outstanding.
Under the Stock Ownership Plan, we have granted restricted stock and
performance units to each member of the Board of Directors who is not also an
officer. During 2000, 1,000 performance units per non-employee director were
issued under this plan at the weighted average fair value of our stock on the
grant date of $575 per share. During 1999 and 1998, 6,000 and 1,700 restricted
shares and units, respectively, were issued under this plan at a weighted
average fair value of our stock on the grant date of $856 and $3731 per share,
respectively. At December 31, 2000, no restricted shares and 7,000 performance
units at an average price of $816 per unit were outstanding under this plan.

Employee Stock Ownership Plans 401k Plans -- We have established
Employee Stock Ownership Plans for the benefit of our employees. Under the plans
participants may elect to defer up to 16% of their salary through contributions
to the plan, which are invested in selected mutual funds or used to buy our
common stock. Through December 31, 2000, we matched qualified contributions with
a contribution of 100% of each employee contribution up to 8% of the
employee salary. Beginning January 1, 2001, this match was reduced to 75% of
each employee contribution up to 8% of the employee salary. These matching
contributions are made in company stock and approximated $16 million and $8
million representing 16 million and 8 million common shares, respectively,
for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. All contributions
vest immediately.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan -- Effective April 1, 1997, we adopted an
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP that allowed U.S. and Canadian employees
to purchase our common stock at a 15% discount. Each year employees
participating in the ESPP were able purchase shares with a discounted value not
to exceed $21,250. Under the ESPP, we sold 281,056, and 613,195 shares to
employees in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the
employee purchase right, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model and the assumptions described below except that the average life
of each purchase right was assumed to be 90 days, was $429 and $631, in 1999
and 1998, respectively. The ESPP was suspended in June 1999, in connection with
the reorganization transactions, and terminated during 2000.

We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, to account for our stock-based compensation plans. We
recognized after-tax stock-based compensation expense in 2000 of $10 million, in
1999 of $11 million, and in 1998 of $3 million, of which $8 million in 1999 and
$3 million in 1998, related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded
to employees of our discontinued operations. Had compensation costs for our
stock-based compensation plans been determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, based on the fair value at the grant
dates for the awards under those plans, our pro forma net income and earnings
per diluted share of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998, would have been lower by $4 million or $11 per diluted common share 13 million or $39 per diluted common share, and $33 million or $19 per
diluted common share, of which $8 million in 1999, and $20 million in 1998
related to employees of our discontinued operations.
Grantor Trust
In August 1998, we established a grantor trust and issued approximately 19
million shares of common stock to the trust. This grantor trust was a so-called
rabbi trust designed to assure the payment of deferred compensation and
supplemental pension benefits. The trust was consolidated in our financial
statements and the shares were reflected in our financial statements as treasury
stock. Consequently, the shares of common stock issued to the trust were not
considered to be outstanding in the computation of earnings per share.
The grantor trust was terminated at the time of the spin-off.
Rights Plan
On September 9, 1998, we adopted a Rights Plan and established an
independent Board committee to review it every three years. The Rights Plan was
adopted to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent a potential acquiror
from gaining control of us in a transaction that is not in the best interests of
our shareholders. Generally, under the Rights Plan, as it has been amended, if a
person becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of our outstanding
common stock, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right
exercise price, a number of shares of our common stock or, under certain
circumstances, of the acquiring person common stock, having a market value of
twice the right exercise price. Rights held by the 15 percent or more holder
will become void and will not be exercisable.
In March 2000, we amended the Rights Plan to i reduce from 20 percent to
15 percent the level of beneficial ownership at which the rights became
exercisable, as described above, and ii eliminate the qualified offer terms
of the plan. These terms provided that the rights would not become exercisable
in connection with a qualified offer, which was defined as an all-cash tender
offer for all outstanding common stock that was fully financed, remained open
for a period of at least 60 business days, resulted in

the offeror owning at least 85% of our common stock after consummation of the
offer, assured a prompt second-step acquisition of shares not purchased in the
initial offer, at the same price as the initial offer, and met certain other
requirements.
In connection with the adoption of the Rights Plan, our Board of Directors
also adopted a three-year independent director evaluation TIDE mechanism.
Under the TIDE mechanism, an independent Board committee will review, on an
ongoing basis, the Rights Plan and developments in rights plans generally, and,
if it deems appropriate, recommend modification or termination of the Rights
Plan. The independent committee will report to our Board at least every three
years as to whether the Rights Plan continues to be in the best interests of our
shareholders.
Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
Under the Tenneco Automotive Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase
Plan, holders of our common stock may apply cash dividends and optional cash
investments to the purchase of additional shares of our common stock.
Stock Repurchase Plans
During 1997, we initiated a common stock repurchase program to acquire up
to 85 million shares. Approximately 75 million shares were acquired under this
program at a total cost of approximately $289 million. All purchases that we
executed through this program were in the open market or negotiated purchases.
No shares have been repurchased subsequent to the spin-off.

9. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all
of our employees. Benefits are based on years of service and, for most salaried
employees, on final average compensation. Our funding policy is to contribute to
the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of applicable
federal or foreign laws and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of
listed equity and fixed income securities.
We have postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover a
majority of our domestic employees. For salaried employees, the plans cover our
employees retiring on or after attaining age 55 who have had at least 10 years
of service with us after attaining age 45. For hourly employees, the
postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who retire according to
one of our hourly employee retirement plans. All of these benefits may be
subject to deductibles, copayment provisions, and other limitations, and we have
reserved the right to change these benefits. Our postretirement benefit plans
are not funded.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair

in excess of plan assets were $44 million, $40 million, and $7 million,
respectively, as of September 30, 2000, and $50 million, $48 million, and $13
million, respectively, as of September 30, 1999. An additional expense of $1
million was recorded in 1999 related to our December adoption of the Tenneco
Automotive Retirement Plan.
The weighted average discount rates which are based on long-term market
rates used in determining the 2000, 1999, and 1998 actuarial present value of
the benefit obligations were 73%, 69%, and 69%, respectively. The rate of
increase in future compensation was 43%, 43%, and 47%, for 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets for 2000, 1999, and 1998 was 94%, 94%, and 98%, respectively.

The weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 5% for all
periods.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would increase the 2000, 1999, and 1998, accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations by approximately $11 million, $13 million, and $13 million,
respectively, and would increase the aggregate of the service cost and interest
cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by approximately
$2 million each year for 2000, 1999, and 1998.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would decrease the 2000 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by approximately $10 million and would
75

determining the 2000, 1999, and 1998 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations were 80%, 750%, and 700 respectively.
10. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION
We are a global manufacturer with two geographic reportable segments: North
America and Europe. Each segment manufactures and distributes ride control and
emission control products primarily for the automotive industry. We have not
aggregated individual operating segments within these reportable segments. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as described in Note 1,
Summary of Accounting Policies. We evaluate segment performance based
primarily on income before interest expense, income taxes, and minority
interest. Products are transferred between segments and geographic areas on a
basis intended to reflect as nearly as possible the market value of the
products. Segment results for 2000, 1999, and 1998 are as follows                                          SEGMENT

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and
regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We expense or capitalize,
as appropriate, expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental
regulations that relate to current operations. We expense expenditures that
relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not
contribute to current or future revenue generation. We record liabilities when
environmental assessments indicate that remedial efforts are probable and the
costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimates of the liability are based upon
currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and
regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other
societal and economic factors. We consider all available evidence including
prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies' cleanup
experience and data released by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency or other organizations. These estimated liabilities are subject to
revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information. Where
future cash flows are fixed and determinable, we have discounted the
liabilities. All other environmental liabilities are recorded at their
undiscounted amounts. We evaluate recoveries separately from the liability and,
when they are assured, recoveries are recorded and reported separately from the
associated liability in our financial statements.
At December 31, 2000, we had been designated as a potentially responsible
party in four Superfund sites. We have estimated our share of the remediation
costs for these sites to be approximately $1 million in the aggregate. In
addition to the Superfund sites, we may have the obligation to remediate current
or former facilities, and we estimate our share of remediation costs at these
facilities to be approximately $16 million. For both the Superfund sites and the
current and former facilities, we have established reserves that we believe are
adequate for these costs. Although we believe our estimates of remediation costs
are reasonable and are based on the latest available information, the cleanup
costs are estimates and are subject to revision as more information becomes
available about the extent of remediation required. At some sites, we expect
that other parties will contribute to the remediation costs. In addition, at the
Superfund sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act provides that our liability could be joint and several, meaning
that we could be required to pay in excess of our share of remediation costs.
Our understanding of the financial strength of other potentially responsible
parties has been considered, where appropriate, in our determination of our
estimated liability.
As previously disclosed, we undertook a third-party evaluation of estimated
environmental remediation costs at one of our facilities in 2000. The evaluation
was initiated as a result of testing that indicated the potential underground
migration of some contaminants beyond our facility property. In the fourth
quarter 2000, we completed the evaluation of on-site contamination and recorded
a charge of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2000 to increase our reserve for
remediation activities, which is reflected in our estimation of remediation
costs described above. We are in the process of completing and analyzing the
results of our evaluation of off-site contamination migration from that facility
and as a result we expect to increase our reserve for this facility in an amount
that we estimate will be in the range of $4 million to $6 million in the first
quarter of 2001. The reserves required could be material to our income statement
in the period when we are required to adjust them. However, we believe that
these potential costs as well as the costs associated with our current status as
a potentially responsible party in the Superfund sites, or as a liable party at
our current or former facilities, will not be material to our consolidated
financial position.

Basis of Presentation
We issued senior subordinated notes due 2009 as a component of a plan to
realign our debt prior to the spin-off. You should also read Note 3,
Discontinued Operations and Extraordinary Loss for further discussion of the
spin-off and debt realignment and Note 5, Financial Instruments for further
discussion of the notes and related guarantee. All of our existing and future
material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries which comprise the Guarantor
Subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee the notes on a joint and
several basis. We have not presented separate financial statements and other
disclosures concerning each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries because management has
determined that such information is not material to the holders of the notes.
Therefore, the Guarantor Subsidiaries are combined in the presentation below.
Included in the financial information of the Guarantor Subsidiaries for
each period presented are the financial position and results of operations of a
domestic subsidiary, Tenneco International Holding Corp., which had issued
preferred stock to a third party.
These condensed consolidating financial statements are presented on the
equity method. Under this method, our investments are recorded at cost and
adjusted for our ownership share of a subsidiary cumulative results of
operations, capital contributions and distributions, and other equity changes.
The balance sheet caption Investment in affiliated companies includes
investments in continuing and discontinued subsidiaries. You should read the
condensed consolidating financial statements of the Guarantor Subsidiaries in
connection with our consolidated financial statements and related notes of which
this note is an integral part.
