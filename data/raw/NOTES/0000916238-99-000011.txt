Maplnfo Corporation and Subsidiaries In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 14a present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of MapInfo Corporation and its subsidiaries at September 30,
1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1999, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 14a presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above.                            PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NATURE OF OPERATIONS
MapInfo designs, develops, markets, licenses and supports software and data
products, application development tools, and industry-focused solutions,
together with a range of consulting, training and technical support services.
These products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including an
indirect channel of value-added resellers and distributors, a corporate account
sales force, and a telemarketing sales group. The Company products are
translated into 20 languages and sold in 58 countries throughout the world.
MapInfo markets its products worldwide through sales offices in North America,
Europe and Australia, and throughout the rest of Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region through exclusive and non-exclusive distribution relationships.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MapInfo
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purpose of the cash flows statements, the Company defines cash and cash
equivalents as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or
less.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on the
average cost method and consist primarily of computer media, user manuals and
software packaging supplies.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturity
dates of one year or less. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, debt securities have
been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
held-to-maturity securities and are reported at amortized cost because the
Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold these debt securities to
maturity. Market value is determined by quoted market prices.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to ten
years for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax
purposes. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the
applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
the resulting gain or loss is recognized.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Product development costs, including product enhancements, are capitalized after
technological feasibility has been established. These costs are reported at the
lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over two to five years, the estimated economic life of the
products. Annual amortization under the straight-line method is greater than the
ratio of current gross revenue to total expected product revenues method.
Amortization expense is classified as research and development expense in the
accompanying consolidated income statements.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method
over five to seven years. The Company continually evaluates the existence of
impairment on the basis of whether the intangible asset is fully recoverable
from projected, undiscounted net cash flows of the related business activity.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company adopted Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition and SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition in the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 and its adoption had no
material impact on the Company operating results or financial position.
PRODUCT REVENUE: Revenue from software and data product licenses and technology
development fees is recognized upon the later of shipment of product or
completion of significant obligations to customers, provided collectibility of
the resulting receivable is probable.
ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER OEM REVENUE: Revenue from products licensed to
original equipment manufacturers is recorded when the product has been shipped
and all obligations of the Company have been satisfied, provided collectibility
of the resulting receivable is probable.
VALUE ADDED RESELLER VAR SALES: Revenue from product sales to distributors and
VAR is recorded when related products are shipped, provided collectibility of
the resulting receivable is probable.
POSTCONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT PCS: PCS, inclusive of technical support and
maintenance, may be bundled with an initial licensing fee or sold separately. In
either case, the fair value of the PCS arrangement is recognized ratably over
the term of the agreement, generally over a one to two year period, provided
collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable.
SERVICES REVENUE: Revenue from services such as training and consulting are
recognized as the services are performed, provided collectibility of the
resulting receivable is probable.

RESERVE FOR RETURNS
The Company as a matter of policy provides the buyer the right to return certain
products within a stated period ranging from 30-60 days, for a refund of the
purchase price or replacement of the product. Accordingly, the Company accrues
for estimated future returns.
ADVERTISING COSTS
The Company expenses all advertising costs as they are incurred.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future years
to differences between financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and
liabilities. The effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is recognized in
the income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date.
Business tax credits are recorded by the flow-through method of accounting,
whereby they are applied as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the
credits are utilized.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated
at year-end exchange rates, and the income statements are translated at the
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains or losses resulting
from translating non-U.S. currency financial statements are accumulated in a
separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in net income. The Company exposure to
foreign currency risk is mitigated, in part, by the fact that it incurs certain
operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which revenues are
denominated.
COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128 -
Earnings Per Share, earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common and diluted common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted common equivalent shares consist of stock options using the
treasury stock method.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130 -
Reporting Comprehensive Income. Under SFAS 130 the Company is required to
report comprehensive income, which includes the Company net income, as well as
changes in equity from other sources. In the Company case, the other changes
in equity included in comprehensive income are comprised of the foreign currency
cumulative translation adjustment.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
hedging activities. It requires that entities recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value. Management does not believe this will have a material effect on
the Company operations. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000.

lease, and in addition to monthly lease payments, the Company is responsible for
such costs as real estate taxes and maintenance. The Company may acquire these
facilities through the termination of these leases at a negotiated purchase
price. The leases expire in 2002 and 2004. The Company also leases office space
of approximately 11,000 square feet in Windsor, England, which houses the
European headquarters. The lease on this facility expires in 2012.
Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial
or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of September
