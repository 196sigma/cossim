Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 1995 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a Business and Presentation
Harbinger NET Services, LLC the Company was organized by Harbinger
Corporation and certain other shareholders in December 1994 and began
operations as a development stage enterprise in March 1995. The Company
develops, markets, and supports software products to enable businesses
to engage in electronic commerce using the Internet.
Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
b Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
c Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
follows                        
Furniture and fixtures      10 years
Computer software         5 years
Computer and office equipment 5-10 years  d Product and Software Development Costs
Product development costs consist principally of compensation and
benefits paid to the Company employees or Harbinger Corporation. All
product development costs not qualifying for capitalization as software
development costs are expensed as incurred.
The Company policy is to expense all software development costs
associated with establishing technological feasibility. Because none of
the Company products have reached this stage of development, the
Company has not capitalized any product development costs in the
accompanying financial statements.  e Income Taxes
The Company has elected to incorporate as a Limited Liability Company in
accordance with the laws in the State of Georgia. As a result, the
Company is taxed as a partnership and has not provided for Federal
- 25   26    or state income taxes as the operations are passed through to, and the
related income taxes become the individual responsibility of, the
Company shareholders.
f Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company uses financial instruments in the normal course of its
business. The carrying values of cash equivalents, other current
assets, accounts payable, due to affiliates, net, and accrued expenses
approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets
and liabilities. The Company believes the fair value of its long-term
debt is not significantly different than its carrying value.
g Recent Accounting Pronouncement
On October 23, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123 allows
companies to retain the current approach set forth in APB Opinion No. 25
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB Opinion No. 25, for
recognizing stock-based expense in their financial statements; however,
companies are encouraged to adopt the new accounting method proposed
under SFAS No. 123 based on the estimated fair value of employee stock
options. Companies that do not follow the new fair value based method
will be required to provide expanded footnote disclosures. The
provisions of SFAS No. 123 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1995. However, disclosure of the pro forma net
income and earnings per share, as if the fair value method for
accounting for stock-based compensation had been elected, is required
for all awards granted in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1994.
The Company intends to continue accounting for stock-related
compensation using APB Opinion No. 25 and will provide the expanded
footnote disclosures required under SFAS No. 123 beginning with its 1996
financial statements.
2 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment as of December 31, 1995 consist of the following

3 Long-Term Debt
In connection with a June 1995 financing, the Company issued a $3 million
subordinated convertible debenture bearing interest at 6% with principal
and accrued interest due in full in June 2000. This financing was
completed simultaneously with a capital investment made by Harbinger
Corporation of $8 million. The Company is party to an Operating Agreement

subordinated convertible debenture, and the Company shareholders which
provides, among other terms, a right of first refusal to Harbinger

additional debt in excess of $75 million. The terms of this agreement
also provide for the automatic conversion of the subordinated convertible
debenture into the number of shares of the Company common stock
