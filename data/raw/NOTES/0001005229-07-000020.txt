We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbus
McKinnon Corporation as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2007. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Columbus McKinnon
Corporation at March 31, 2007 and 2006 and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally  accepted  accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 1,
2006 the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, on March 31,
2007 the Company changed its method of accounting for employee retirement plans
and other postretirement benefits.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Columbus
McKinnon Corporation internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated May 25, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.               /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
TABULAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA
1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Columbus McKinnon Corporation the Company is a leading U.S. designer and
manufacturer of material handling  products,  systems and services which
efficiently and ergonomically move, lift, position and secure material. Key
products include hoists, cranes, chain and forged attachments. The Company
material  handling products are sold,  domestically and  internationally,
principally to third party distributors through diverse distribution channels,
and to a lesser extent directly to end-users. The Company integrated material
handling solutions businesses deal primarily with end users and sales are
concentrated, domestically and internationally primarily Europe, in the
consumer products, manufacturing, warehousing and, to a lesser extent, the
steel, construction, automotive and other industrial markets. During fiscal
2007, approximately 66% of sales were to customers in the United States. 2.  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES
ADVERTISING
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are
included in selling expense in the statement of operations. Advertising expenses
were $3,779,000, $3,343,000, and $2,521,000 in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.
CONCENTRATIONS OF LABOR
Approximately 24% of the Company employees are represented by seven
separate domestic and Canadian collective bargaining agreements which terminate
at various times between July 2007 and August 2010. Approximately 2% of the
labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire
within one year.
CONSOLIDATION
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its domestic and foreign subsidiaries; all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.
DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Derivative instruments held by the Company that have high correlation with
the underlying exposure and are highly effective in offsetting underlying price
movements are designated as hedges. Accordingly, gains and losses from changes
in derivatives fair values are deferred until the underlying transaction occurs
at which point they are then recognized in the statement of operations. When
derivatives are not designated as hedges, the gains and losses from changes in
fair value are recorded currently in the statement of operations.  All
derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair values of
derivatives are determined by reference to quoted market prices. The Company
use of derivative instruments has historically been limited to cash flow hedges
of certain interest rate risks.
The carrying value of the Company current assets and current liabilities

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS
The Company translates foreign currency financial statements as described
in Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Under this method, all
items of income and expense are translated to U.S. dollars at average exchange
rates for the year. All assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at
the year-end exchange rate. Gains or losses on translations are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss in the shareholders' equity section of the
balance sheet. The functional currency is the foreign currency in which the
foreign subsidiaries conduct their business. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are reported in other income and expense, net. There was
approximately a $225,000 loss, a $100,000 loss and a $200,000 gain on foreign
currency transactions in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
GOODWILL
Goodwill is not amortized but is periodically tested for impairment, in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a reporting
unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The Company
reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information
is available and regularly reviewed, whether those units constitute a business,
and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for
purposes of aggregation. As a result of this analysis, the reporting units
identified under SFAS No. 142 were at the component level, or one level below
the reporting segment level as defined under SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Products segment was
subdivided into three reporting units and the Solutions segment was subdivided
into two reporting units. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business
combination are amortized over their useful lives unless their useful lives are
indefinite, in which case those intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually and not amortized until their lives are determined to be finite. See
Note 8 for further discussion of goodwill and intangible assets.
INVENTORIES
Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost or market.  Cost of
approximately 60% of inventories at March 31, 2007 58% in 2006 has been
determined using the LIFO last-in,  first-out method.  Costs of other
inventories have been determined using the FIFO first-in, first-out or average
cost method. FIFO cost approximates replacement cost.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
All of the Company marketable securities, which consist of equity
securities and corporate and governmental obligations, have been classified as
available-for-sale securities and are therefore recorded at their fair values
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in accumulated other
comprehensive loss within shareholders' equity unless unrealized losses are
deemed to be other than temporary. In such instance, the unrealized losses are
reported in the statement of operations within investment income. Estimated fair
value is based on published trading values at the balance sheet dates. The
amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific identification method. Interest and dividend income are included in
investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.
The marketable securities are carried as long-term assets since they are
held for the settlement of the Company general and products liability
insurance claims filed through CM Insurance Company, Inc., a wholly owned
captive insurance subsidiary.                    F-8              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Property,  plant, and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated
principally using the straight-line method over their respective estimated
useful lives buildings and building equipment--15 to 40 years; machinery and
equipment--3 to 18 years. When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise
disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating results.
RECLASSIFICATION/REVISIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development costs as defined in SFAS No. 2, Accounting for
Research and Development Costs for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 were $2,887,000, $1,614,000 and $1,289,000, respectively and are classified
as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of
operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Sales are recorded when title passes to the customer which is generally at
time of shipment to the customer, except for long-term construction contracts as
described below. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition, but generally does not require collateral to
support customer receivables. The credit risk is controlled through credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Accounts receivable are reported at
net realizable value and do not accrue interest. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk
of specific customers, historical trends and other factors. Accounts receivable
are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once all collection
efforts have been exhausted. The Company does not routinely permit customers to
return product. However, sales returns are permitted in specific situations and
typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product. The
Company has established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends.
The Company recognizes contract revenues under the percentage of completion
method, measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total estimated direct
costs. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability,
including those arising from final contract settlements, may result in revisions
to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are
determined. In the event that a loss is anticipated on an uncompleted contract,
a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time it is determined.
Billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned, and such differences
are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities accrued liabilities
and current assets unbilled revenues, respectively.  SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS
On January 28, 2005, the Company sold its corporate headquarters property
and entered into a leaseback for a portion of the facility under a 10-year lease
agreement. Net proceeds to the Company for the sale of the property were
approximately $27 million and the gain on the transaction was $22 million. Of
the total gain, $10 million was recognized in 2005 under the caption other
income, and $12 million was deferred and will be recognized as income over the
10-year leaseback period. Additionally, $05 million of non-cash value rent
abatement will be recognized on a straight-line basis as lower operating
expenses over the 10-year leaseback period.                    F-9              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED  SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS
Shipping and handling costs are a component of cost of products sold.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based
Payment, applying the modified prospective method. This Statement requires all
equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value
of the award. Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to
record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date
of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously  granted awards
outstanding as of the date of adoption. The adoption of SFAS 123R resulted in
$1,230 of non-deductible incentive stock option expense in the year ended March
31, 2007. Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold, selling,
and general and administrative expense. The Company uses a straight-line method
of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense, subject to minimum
levels of expense, based on vesting.
Prior to April 1, 2006, the Company accounted for the stock option plans
under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
Interpretations. No stock-based employee compensation cost was reflected in net
income, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and the
number of options granted was fixed.
The Company net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based
method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards for the
comparable prior years is as follows                                    YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,

In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Staff Position FSP FAS 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting
for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. FSP FAS 123R-3 provides an
alternative transition method for establishing the beginning balance of the pool
of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies  recognized
subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R the APIC Pool. Effective in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company elected to adopt the alternative
transition method provided in FSP FAS 123R-3 for establishing the beginning
balance of the APIC Pool. This method consists of a computational component that
establishes  a beginning  balance of the APIC Pool related to employee
compensation and a simplified method short-cut method to determine the
subsequent impact on the APIC Pool of employee awards that are fully vested and
outstanding upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
WARRANTIES
The Company offers warranties for certain of the products it sells. The
specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the
product sold and the country in which the Company sold the product. The Company
generally provides a basic limited warranty, including parts and labor for any
product deemed to be defective for a period of one year. The Company estimates
the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty, based largely
upon actual warranty repair costs history, and records a liability in the amount
of such costs in the month that the product revenue is recognized. The resulting
accrual balance is reviewed during the year. Factors that affect the Company
warranty liability include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated
rate of warranty claims, and cost per claim.
Changes in the Company product warranty accrual are as follows

Company  former Solutions - Automotive  segment.  The Company received
$20,600,000 in cash and an 8% subordinated note in the principal amount of
$6,800,000 which is payable at a rate of $214,000 per quarter over eight years
beginning August 2004. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial
viability of the debtor, the note has been recorded at the estimated net
realizable value of $0. Principal payments received on the note are recorded as
income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt. All interest and
principal payments required under the note have been made to date. The gross

Marketable securities are held for the settlement of the Company general
and products liability insurance claims filed through the Company subsidiary,
CM Insurance Company, Inc. see Notes 2 and 14. In accordance with SFAS No.
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, the
Company reviews its marketable securities for declines in market value that may
be considered other than temporary. The Company considers market value declines
to be other than temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six
months and in excess of 20% of original cost. Based on our review as of March
31, 2007, no unrealized losses represent an other than temporary impairment.

As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is not amortized but is periodically
tested for impairment, in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of a reporting
unit is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The Company
reporting units are determined based upon whether discrete financial information
is available and regularly reviewed, whether those units constitute a business,
and the extent of economic similarities between those reporting units for
purposes of aggregation. As a result of this analysis, the reporting units
identified under SFAS No. 142 were at the component level, or one level below
the reporting segment level as defined under SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. The Products segment was
subdivided into three reporting units and the Solutions segment was subdivided
into two reporting units.
Identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are
amortized over their useful lives unless their useful lives are indefinite, in
which case those intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and not
amortized until their lives are determined to be finite.
No impairment charges were recorded during fiscal 2007, 2006 or 2005.
All goodwill reported in fiscal 2007 and 2006 was related to the products
segment. A summary of changes in goodwill during the years ended March 31, 2007

In March, 2006, the Company amended and expanded its revolving credit
facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides availability up to a maximum of
$75,000,000. Provided there is no default, the Company may on a one-time basis,
request an increase in the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility by an
amount not exceeding $50,000,000 if all Senior Secured Notes have been repaid in
full or will be repaid in full contemporaneously with such increase, or
$25,000,000 in the event that any Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding,
subject to lender approval. The unused Revolving Credit Facility totaled
$64,800,000, net of outstanding borrowings of $0 and outstanding letters of
credit of $10,200,000. Interest on the revolver is payable at varying Eurodollar
rates based on LIBOR or prime plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio
amounting to 875 or 0 basis points, respectively, at March 31, 2007. The
Revolving Credit Facility is secured by all domestic inventory, receivables,

stock offering see Note 13 to repurchase $47,616,000 of the outstanding 10%
Notes. The repurchase of the 10% Notes occurred at a premium resulting in a
pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4,786,000. As a result of the
repurchase of the 10% Notes, $1,085,000 of pre-tax deferred financing costs was
written-off. The net effect of these items was a $5,871,000 pre-tax loss in
fiscal 2006.
During fiscal 2007, the Company used cash on hand to repurchase $45,259,000
of the outstanding 10% Notes. The repurchase of the 10% Notes occurred at a

11.  PENSIONS AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
The Company provides retirement and pension plans, including defined
benefit and defined contribution plans, and postretirement benefit plans to
certain employees. Effective March 31, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No. 158,
Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R, which
required the  recognition in pension and other  postretirement  benefits
obligations and accumulated other comprehensive income of actuarial gains or
losses, prior service costs or credits and transition assets or obligations that
had previously been deferred under the reporting requirements of SFAS No. 87,
SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 132R. This statement also requires an entity to
measure a defined benefit postretirement plan assets and obligations that
determine its funded status as of the end of the employers' fiscal year. This
requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
PENSION PLANS
The Company provides defined benefit pension plans to certain employees.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
The Company has an investment objective for domestic pension plans to
adequately provide for both the growth and liquidity needed to support all
current and future benefit payment obligations. The investment strategy is to
invest in a diversified portfolio of assets which are expected to satisfy the
aforementioned objective and produce both absolute and risk adjusted returns
competitive with a benchmark that is a blend of major US and international
equity indexes and an aggregate bond fund. The shift to the targeted allocation
is the result of management re-evaluation of its investment allocation. The
targeted allocation will be accomplished as some plan assets governed by
collective bargaining contracts will be transferred from fixed income into
equity securities, as well as reallocation of remaining assets to achieve the
desired balance during fiscal 2008.
The Company funding policy with respect to the defined benefit pension
plans is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount required by the
Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974  ERISA.  Additional
contributions may be made to minimize PBGC premiums. The Company expects to
contribute $12,208,000 to its pension plans in fiscal 2008.
Information about the expected benefit payments for the Company defined
benefit plans is as follows         2008        $  5,485

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors defined benefit postretirement health care plans that
provide medical and life insurance coverage to certain domestic retirees and
their dependents of one of its subsidiaries. Prior to the acquisition of this
subsidiary, the Company did not sponsor any postretirement benefit plans. The
Company pays the majority of the medical costs for certain retirees and their
spouses who are under age 65. For retirees and dependents of retirees who
retired prior to January 1, 1989, and are age 65 or over, the Company
contributes 100% toward the American Association of Retired Persons AARP
premium frozen at the 1992 level. For retirees and dependents of retirees who
retired after January 1, 1989, the Company contributes $35 per month toward the
AARP premium. The life insurance plan is noncontributory.
The Company postretirement health benefit plans are not funded. The
following sets forth a reconciliation of benefit obligation and the funded

The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans covering substantially
all  domestic  employees.  Participants  may elect to  contribute  basic
contributions. These plans provide for employer contributions based primarily on
employee participation. The Company recorded a charge for such contributions of
approximately $1,650,000, $1,476,000 and $673,000 for the years ended March 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 12.  EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ESOP
The AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, Employers' Accounting for Employee
Stock Ownership Plans requires that compensation expense for ESOP shares be
measured based on the fair value of those shares when committed to be released
to employees, rather than based on their original cost. Also, dividends on those
ESOP shares that have not been allocated or committed to be released to ESOP
participants are not reflected as a reduction of retained earnings. Rather,
since those dividends are used for debt service, a charge to compensation
expense is recorded. Furthermore, ESOP shares that have not been allocated or
committed to be released are not considered outstanding for purposes of
calculating earnings per share.
The obligation of the ESOP to repay borrowings incurred to purchase shares
of the Company common stock is guaranteed by the Company; the unpaid balance
of such borrowings, if any, would be reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
as a liability. An amount equivalent to the cost of the collateralized common
stock and representing deferred employee benefits has been recorded as a
deduction from shareholders' equity.
Substantially all of the Company domestic non-union employees are
participants in the ESOP. Contributions to the plan result from the release of
collateralized shares as debt service payments are made. Compensation expense
amounting to $808,000, $653,000 and $296,000 in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, is recorded based on the guaranteed release of the ESOP shares at
their fair market value. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares, if any, are
recorded as a reduction of retained earnings and are applied toward debt
service.
At March 31, 2007 and 2006,  694,751 and 723,618 of ESOP shares,
respectively, were allocated or available to be allocated to participants'
accounts. At March 31, 2007 and 2006, 213,667 and 249,821 of ESOP shares were
pledged as collateral to guarantee the ESOP term loans.
The fair market value of unearned ESOP shares at March 31, 2007 amounted to
$4,784,000.                    F-21              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

EARNINGS PER SHARE
The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS No. 128.
Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive effects
of stock options.

The weighted-average common stock outstanding shown above is net of
unallocated ESOP shares see Note 12. The increase in the weighted-average
common stock outstanding is the result of the issuance of 3,000,000 shares in
fiscal 2006 and the exercising of stock options.
STOCK PLANS
Effective April 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based
Payment, applying the modified prospective method. This Statement requires all
equity-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options,
to be recognized in the statement of earnings based on the grant date fair value
of the award. Under the modified prospective method, the Company is required to
record equity-based compensation expense for all awards granted after the date
of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously  granted awards
outstanding as of the date of adoption. The adoption of SFAS 123R resulted in
$1,230,000 of non-deductible incentive stock option expense in the year ended
March 31, 2007. Stock compensation expense is included in cost of goods sold,
selling,  and general and  administrative  expense.  The Company uses a
straight-line method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation
expense, subject to minimum levels of expense, based on vesting.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Effective July 31, 2006, the shareholders of the Company approved the
adoption of our Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP. The total number of shares of
common stock with respect to which awards may be granted under the plan is
850,000. The LTIP was designed as an omnibus plan and awards may consist of
non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock bonuses. A maximum of 600,000
shares may be awarded as restricted stock, restricted stock units, or stock
bonuses.
During fiscal 2007, a total of 9,390 shares of stock and 7,200 restricted
stock units were granted under the LTIP to the Company non-executive directors
as part of their annual compensation. The weighted average fair value grant
price of those shares and units was $1917. The expense related to the shares
and  restricted  stock units for fiscal 2007 was $180,000 and $40,000,
respectively.
As of March 31, 2007, there were 833,410 shares available for future grants
under the Long Term Incentive Plan.                    F-22              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

STOCK OPTION PLANS
Existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintains two stock
option plans, a Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan Non-Qualified Plan and an
Incentive Stock Option Plan Incentive Plan. Under the Non-Qualified Plan,
options may be granted to officers and other key employees of the Company as
well as to non-employee directors and advisors. As of March 31, 2007, no options
have been granted to non-employees. Options granted under the Non-Qualified and
Incentive Plans become exercisable over a four-year period at the rate of 25%
per year commencing one year from the date of grant at an exercise price of not
less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of
grant. Any option granted under the Non-Qualified plan may be exercised not
earlier than one year from the date such option is granted. Any option granted
under the Incentive Plan may be exercised not earlier than one year and not

We calculated intrinsic value for those options that had an exercise price
lower than the market price of our common shares as of March 31, 2007. The
aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options as of March 31, 2007 is
calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying
options and the market price of our common shares for the 884,050 options that
were in-the-money at that date. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable
options as of March 31, 2007 is calculated as the difference between the
exercise price of the underlying options and the market price of our common
shares for the 544,050 exercisable options that were in-the-money at that date.
The Company closing stock price was $2239 as of March 31, 2007. The total
intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $3,434,000, $6,487,000 and
$248,000 during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of March 31, 2007,
there are 132,600 options available for future grants under the two stock option
plans.
The fair value of shares that vested was $387, $401 and $464 during
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Cash received from option  exercises under all share-based  payment
arrangements during fiscal 2007 was $2,601,000. Proceeds from the exercise of
stock options under stock option plans are credited to common stock at par value
and the excess is credited to additional paid-in capital.
As of March 31, 2007, $1,461,000 of unrecognized compensation cost related
to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 3 years.                    F-23              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

The fair value of stock options granted was estimated on the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation
model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which
have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do
not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its
employee stock options. The weighted-average fair value of the options was
$1293, $1213 and $345 for options granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used

the United States Treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the appropriate
term of the options granted. Expected dividends are based on the Company
history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected term of stock options
is based on vesting schedules, expected exercise patterns and contractual terms.
RESTRICTED STOCK
Also existing prior to the adoption of the LTIP, the Company maintains a
Restricted  Stock Plan.  The Company  charges  compensation  expense and
shareholders' equity for the market value of shares ratably over the restricted
period. Grantees that remain continuously employed with the Company become
vested in their shares five years after the date of the grant. As of March 31,
2007, there were 48,000 shares available for future grants under the Restricted
Stock Plan.                    F-24              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

During the Fiscal 2007, no shares of restricted stock were granted. As of
March 31, 2007, there are 2,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding with a
weighted average fair value grant price of $1625. The expense related to
restricted stock was $7,000, $6,000 and $35,000 for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
14.  LOSS CONTINGENCIES
From time to time, the Company is named a defendant in legal actions
arising out of the normal course of business. The Company is not a party to any
pending legal proceeding other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to
our business. The Company does not believe that any of our pending litigation
will have a material impact on its business.
GENERAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY-- During fiscal 2006, the Company reevaluated
the predictability of future cash flows associated with its self-insured product
liability and asbestos reserves and concluded that future cash payments related
to reserves for nonasbestos claims could no longer be discounted due to their
underlying uncertainty. Reserves for asbestos claims continue to be discounted
at a risk free rate. This change in estimate resulted in a reduction in the
discount recorded by the company of approximately $1,578,000 $009 diluted EPS
impact for fiscal 2006. The gross reserves as of March 31, 2007 and 2006 were
$23,438,000 and $23,329,000,  respectively.  This liability is funded by
investments in marketable securities see Notes 2 and 6.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
balances for accrued general and product liability

The per occurrence limits on our self-insurance for general and product
liability coverage to Columbus McKinnon were $2,000,000 from inception through
fiscal 2003 and $3,000,000 for fiscal 2004 and thereafter. In addition to the
per occurrence limits, the Company coverage is also subject to an annual
aggregate limit, applicable to losses only. These limits range from $2,000,000
to $6,000,000 for each policy year from inception through fiscal 2007.
Along with other manufacturing companies, the Company is subject to various
federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment. To
address the requirements of such laws, the Company has adopted a corporate
environmental protection policy which provides that all of its owned or leased
facilities shall, and all of its employees have the duty to, comply with all
applicable environmental regulatory standards, and the Company has initiated an
environmental auditing program for our facilities to ensure compliance with such
regulatory  standards.  The  Company  has  also  established  managerial
responsibilities  and  internal  communication  channels for dealing with
environmental compliance issues that may arise in the course of our business.
Because of the complexity and changing nature of environmental regulatory
standards, it is possible that situations will arise from time to time requiring
the Company to incur expenditures in order to ensure environmental regulatory
compliance. However, the Company is not aware of any environmental condition or
any operation at any of its facilities, either individually or in the aggregate,
which would cause expenditures having a material adverse effect on its results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows and, accordingly, has not
budgeted any material capital expenditures for environmental compliance for
fiscal 2008.
Like many  industrial  manufacturers,  the  Company is  involved in
asbestos-related litigation. In continually evaluating costs relating to its
estimated asbestos-related liability, the Company reviews, among other things,
the incidence of past and recent claims, the historical case dismissal rate, the
mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs, its recent and
historical resolution of the cases, the number of cases pending against it, the
status and results of broad-based settlement discussions, and the number of
years such activity might continue. Based on this
F-25             COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
review, the Company has estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve
probable asbestos-related personal injury claims. This estimate is highly
uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of
forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range
of the liability. The Company will continue to study the variables in light of
additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and
to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable.
Based on  actuarial  information,  the  Company has  estimated  its
asbestos-related aggregate liability through March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2037
to range between $5,000,000 and $14,000,000 using actuarial parameters of
continued claims for a period of 18 to 30 years. The Company estimation of its
asbestos-related  aggregate liability that is probable and estimable, in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles approximates
$8,400,000 which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial
statements as of March 31, 2007. The increase in the recorded liability from the
amount of $6,300,000 at March 31, 2006 is due to the increase in historical data
used to calculate required asbestos liability reserve levels. The recorded
liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal
legislation. This liability may fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number
of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims, which
may be influenced by a number of factors, including the outcome of the ongoing
broad-based settlement negotiations, defensive strategies, and the cost to
resolve claims outside the broad-based settlement program. Of this amount,
management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately
$325,000 over the next 12 months. Because payment of the liability is likely to
extend over many years, management believes that the potential additional costs
for claims will not have a material after-tax effect on the financial condition
of the Company or its liquidity, although the net after-tax effect of any future
liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period. 15.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
The Company analyzes its global capacity requirements in accordance with
its ongoing cost savings and consolidation efforts. As a result, facilities are
closed or significantly reorganized and production operations are transferred to
other facilities within the same reporting segment, to better utilize their
available capacity. During fiscal 2007, the Company recorded restructuring costs
of $543,000 for severance and the maintenance of non-operating facilities being
held for sale which are expensed on an as incurred basis in accordance with SFAS
No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
$519,000 and $24,000 of these costs are related to the Solutions and Products
segments, respectively. The completion of the sale of a previously closed
facility resulted in the reversal of $410,000 of restructuring charges within
the Products segment, including $216,000 of gain on the sale of a non-operating
property that had been written down in previous years. The liability as of March
31, 2007 consists primarily of environmental remediation costs which were
accrued in accordance with SFAS No. 143.
During fiscal 2006, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $1,609,000
related to environmental remediation charges, inventory disposal costs, and
facility costs as a result of the continued closure, merging and reorganization
of the Company. $1,000,000 and $600,000 of these costs are related to the
Products and Solutions segments, respectively. The charges primarily relate to
the cost of removal of certain environmentally hazardous materials in accordance
with SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations and FIN 47
$600,000 and inventory disposal related to the rationalization of certain
product families within our mechanical jacks line $400,000. In addition, we
have accrued additional costs of maintenance of a non-operating facility based
on anticipated sale date $300,000. The costs associated with the disposal of
this facility were originally accrued as a result of the restructuring occurring
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146, Accounting for the Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities. As of March 31, 2006, the liability primarily
consisted of costs associated with the preparation and maintenance of a
non-operating facility and environmental remediation costs which were accrued in
accordance with SFAS No. 143. The Company had one facility that was completely
closed and prepared for disposal.
During fiscal 2005, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $910,000
related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a result
of the continued closure, merging and reorganization of the Company. $600,000
and $300,000 of these costs are related to the Products and Solutions segments,
respectively. The charges primarily relate to the maintenance of facilities
being expensed on an as incurred basis in accordance with SFAS No. 146. As of
March 31, 2005, the liability primarily consisted of costs associated with the
preparation

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED and maintenance of a non-operating facility prior to disposal which were accrued
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 146. Due to changes in the real estate market
and a reassessment of the fair value of the property, the asset was written-down
by $300,000 during fiscal 2005.

As of March 31, 2007, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $38,527,000. The net operating loss carryforwards
arose in fiscal 2004 primarily as a result of a worthless stock deduction taken
on the Company March 31, 2003 federal income tax return relating to the sale
of substantially all of the assets of a domestic subsidiary. If not utilized,
these carryforwards will expire in fiscal years 2023 and 2024.
Deferred income taxes are classified within the consolidated balance sheets
based on the following breakdown

liabilities, and other non-current liabilities, respectively.
Income from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit
includes foreign subsidiary income of $10,067,000, $13,034,000 and $8,588,000
for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. As of March
31, 2007, the Company had unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to
approximately $20 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. These earnings are considered to be permanently invested in
operations  outside the United States.  Determination  of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability with respect to such earnings is
not practicable.
There were 136,511 and 581,064 shares of common stock were issued through
the exercise of non-qualified stock options or through the disqualifying
disposition of incentive stock options in the years ended March 31, 2007, and
2006, respectively. The tax benefit to the Company from these transactions,
which is credited to additional paid-in capital rather than recognized as a
reduction of income tax expense, was $311,000 and $2,154,000 in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. This tax benefit has also been recognized in the consolidated
balance sheet as an increase in deferred tax assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED 19.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
As a result of the way the Company manages the business, its reportable
segments are strategic business units that offer products with different
characteristics. The most defining characteristic is the extent of customized
engineering required on a per-order basis. In addition, the segments serve
different customer bases through differing methods of distribution. The Company
has two reportable segments: Products and Solutions. The Company Products
segment sells hoists, industrial cranes, chain, attachments, and other material
handling products principally to third party distributors through diverse
distribution channels, and to a lesser extent directly to end-users. The
Solutions segment sells engineered material handling systems such as conveyors
and lift tables primarily to end-users in the consumer products, manufacturing,
warehousing, and, to a lesser extent, the steel, construction, automotive, and
other industrial markets. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant  accounting  policies.
Intersegment sales are not significant. The Company evaluates performance based
on the operating earnings of the respective business units.   Segment information as of and for the years ended March 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005 is as follows:

Accumulated other comprehensive   $  15,337   $12,979
The adjustment to pension liability in fiscal 2007 includes an adjustment
of $7,257,000, net of tax, and the adjustment to other postretirement
obligations includes an adjustment of $3,083,000, net of tax, relating to the
initial adoption of SFAS No. 158. Refer to Note 11.
The deferred taxes associated with the items included in accumulated other
comprehensive  loss were  $14,102,000 and $9,486,000 for 2007 and 2006,
respectively. As a result of the recording of a deferred tax asset valuation
allowance in fiscal 2005, the Company recorded as an offsetting entry a $534,000
charge in the minimum pension liability component of other comprehensive income.
With the reversal of that valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 see Note 16, the
Company recorded the reversal of the valuation allowance as a reduction of
income taxes in the statement of operations. This is in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, even though the valuation
allowance was initially established by a charge against comprehensive income.
This amount will remain indefinitely as a component of minimum pension liability
adjustment.
The activity by year related to investments, including reclassification
adjustments for activity included in earnings is as follows all items shown net

22.   EFFECTS OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.
FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 Accounting for Income
Taxes and must be adopted by the Company no later than April 1, 2007. FIN 48
prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and
disclosing in the financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company
has taken or expects to take in the Company tax returns. The Company is
required to apply the provisions of FIN 48 to all tax positions upon initial
adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be recognized as an adjustment
to retained earnings as of April 1, 2007. FIN 48 was effective beginning in
fiscal 2008 and did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated
financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, to define fair value,
establish a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles,  and expand disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. The Company is assessing the impact the adoption of SFAS No.
157 will have on the Company consolidated financial position and results of
operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R SFAS 158. Among other items, SFAS 158
requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of an entity
defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial
statements and requires recognition of the funded status of defined benefit
postretirement plans in other comprehensive income. We adopted all of the
required provisions of Statement 158 in fiscal 2007 as discussed in footnote 11.
This  statement  also requires an entity to measure a defined  benefit
postretirement plan assets and obligations that determine its funded status as
of the end of the employers' fiscal year. This requirement is effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the
adoption of this requirement to have a material impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements.                    F-38              COLUMBUS MCKINNON CORPORATION

MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As of March 31, 2007, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation,  our
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March
31, 2007. There were no changes in our internal controls or in other factors
during our fourth quarter ended March 31, 2007.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f.  Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007 based on the
framework in Internal Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of March 31, 2007.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein.       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Columbus McKinnon Corporation
We have audited  management  assessment,  included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Columbus
McKinnon Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated  Framework  issued  by the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Columbus McKinnon
Corporation management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
30 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Columbus McKinnon Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, Columbus McKinnon Corporation maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2007, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
Columbus McKinnon Corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007 and 2006,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2007 of
Columbus McKinnon Corporation and subsidiaries, and our report dated May 25,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
