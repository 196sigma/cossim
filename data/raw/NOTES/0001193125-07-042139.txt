MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of ADTRAN, Inc. is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting is designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADTRANs internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADTRAN;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADTRAN; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADTRANs assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To Board of Directors and Shareholders of ADTRAN, Inc.: We have completed integrated audits of ADTRAN Inc.s consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ADTRAN, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation effective January1, 2006. Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Birmingham, Alabama February28, 2007

38 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ADTRAN, Inc. designs, develops,
manufactures, markets and services network access solutions for communications networks utilized by providers of telecommunications services serviced by our Carrier Networks Division, and small and mid-sized businesses and enterprises serviced by
our Enterprise Networks Division. Our solutions enable voice, data, video, and Internet communications across copper, fiber and wireless networks. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include ADTRAN and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market accounts, and short-term investments classified as available for sale see Note 3 with original
maturities of three months or less. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The
carrying amount reported for bonds payable approximates fair value. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on
their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Investments represent municipal bonds, and marketable equity securities. Variable rate municipal bonds are
designed to be marketed as money market instruments. These instruments interest rates reset on a short-term basis to maintain the price of the instruments at par. These instruments may be redeemed on the date the interest rate resets. The fair
value of short-term investments is estimated based on quoted market prices see Note 3. Long-term investments represent a restricted certificate of
deposit, municipal bonds, marketable equity securities, and other equity and debt investments. The fair value of the restricted certificate of deposit approximates fair value. Marketable equity securities are reported at market value as determined
by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available market. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported as a separate
component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method and are included in current income. We periodically review our investment portfolio for investments
considered to have sustained an other-than-temporary decline in value. Impairment charges for other-than-temporary declines in value are recorded as realized losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. All of our investments at
December31, 2006 and 2005 are classified as available-for-sale see Note 3. Other Receivables Other receivables are comprised primarily of accrued interest, amounts due from subcontract manufacturers for product component transfer, and rebates due from vendors.
Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of cost
or market, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory. All standard costs are rolled forward on a monthly basis; therefore, inventory
costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value of the
inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related write-downs are charged against the inventory reserve. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, which
are stated at cost, are depreciated using methods which approximate straight-line depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery 
39 Table of Contents 
and equipment from three to seven years and engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Betterments that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the gain or
loss on such disposition is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Liability
for Warranty Our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the cost to repair or
replace the defective products at the time revenue is recognized. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become
more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products. These products will require more warranty repairs to be completed at the installed location due to their size and
complexity, rather than at a manufacturing site or repair depot. This field service obligation, as well as the increasing complexity of our products, will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future
warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise.
Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such
provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty returns totaled $30 million and $40 million at December31, 2006 and 2005 respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.  Year Ended December31 2006 2005 in thousands Balance at beginning of period 3,972 1,560 Plus: amounts acquired or charged to cost and expenses 1,097 4,320 Less: deductions 2,024 1,908 Balance at end of period 3,045 3,972 Stock-Based Compensation Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method.
SFAS 123R requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the grant date and recognition of compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R,
ADTRAN recorded the intrinsic value of stock-based compensation as expense, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25, and related interpretations, as
allowed under SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation Expense SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, no material amount of stock-based compensation expense had been recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income
prior to January1, 2006, because the exercise price of our stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. SFAS 123 allowed us to recognize forfeitures as they occur, while SFAS 123R requires us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a regular basis. As such, we evaluated the need to record a cumulative effect adjustment for
estimated forfeitures upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. Because this adjustment only applies to the extent that compensation cost was previously recognized for the unvested awards, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded upon adoption. SFAS 123R
requires cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the related compensation cost recognized in the financial statements excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. In accordance with SFAS 123R, excess tax benefits
recognized in periods after the adoption date have been properly classified as financing cash flows. Excess tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the adoption date are classified as operating cash flows. We have two Board and stockholder approved stock option plans from which stock options and other awards are available for grant to employees and directors. All employee
and director stock options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the fair market value, as defined in the plan, of the underlying common stock on the grant date. There are currently no vesting provisions tied to
performance or market conditions for any option; vesting for all outstanding option grants is based only on continued service as an employee of ADTRAN. All of our outstanding stock option awards are classified as equity instruments. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123R for fiscal 2006 was approximately $81 million. As of December31, 2006, total compensation cost related
to unvested stock options not yet recognized was approximately $217 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 28 years on a weighted average basis. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
40 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment under the guidance prescribed by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We
evaluate long-lived assets used in operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset is
less than the assets carrying values. An impairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market price of an asset or an estimate based on
the best information available in the circumstances. There were no such losses recognized during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation for engineers and support personnel, outside contracted services, and
material costs associated with new product development, the enhancement of current products, and product cost reductions. We continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts. Research
and development costs totaled $707 million, $627 million and $674 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $30 million, $27 million, and $29 million for the
years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources. Items included in comprehensive income include net income, changes in unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income Loss. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes has been determined
using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The
provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between financial and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and
are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Foreign Currency We record transactions denominated in foreign
currencies on a monthly basis using exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those foreign currencies and
the U.S. dollar with any transaction gains or losses reported in income. Adjustments from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss. Revenue Recognition Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of
the product to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement, generally FOB shipping point. In the case of consigned inventory, revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product.
When contracts contain multiple elements, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element contract should be treated as separate units of
accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We record revenue associated with installation services when the installation and all
contractual obligations are complete. When contracts include both installation and product sales, the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item. Either the purchaser, ADTRAN, or a third party can perform the installation of our
products. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales. Revenue is recorded net of discounts. Also, revenue is recorded when the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting
receivable is probable, and product returns are reasonably estimable. 
41 Table of Contents The majority of Enterprise Networks products are sold in the United States through a non-exclusive distribution network
of major technology distributors. These large organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value-added resellers and system integrators. Value-added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel partner, or they
may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion. Our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock-balancing purposes when such returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value.
We participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers. We use these programs to reimburse customers for certain
forms of advertising, and in general, to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases. Our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in marketing expenses
in our consolidated statements of income. We also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products. Our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale, and are recorded as a
reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on our maintenance service programs and deferred revenues relating to multiple element contracts where we still have contractual obligations. We currently offer
one-year, three-year, and five-year maintenance contracts, primarily on Enterprise Networks Division products sold through distribution channels. Revenue attributable to maintenance contracts is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the
related contract term. Other Income Expense Other
income expense includes miscellaneous income or expense, gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, raw material scrap sales, and litigation costs. Earnings Per Share Earnings per common share, and earnings per common share assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of
common shares and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year see Note 11. Dividends The Board of Directors presently anticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend so long as the current tax treatment of dividends exists and adequate
levels of liquidity are maintained. During the year ended December31, 2006, ADTRAN paid $268 million in dividend payments. On January22, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $009 per common share to be
paid to holders of record at the close of business on February8, 2007. The ex-dividend date was February6, 2007 and the payment date was February22, 2007. The quarterly dividend payment was $63 million. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. ADTRANs more significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, obsolete and excess inventory
reserves, warranty reserves, rebates, allowance for sales returns, estimated income tax contingencies and the fair value of stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Changes in Classifications Certain changes in classifications have
been made to the prior period balances in order to conform to the current periods presentation. Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force in Issue No06-3 EITF 06-3, How Taxes Collected from
Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That is, Gross versus Net Presentation. The scope of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly
imposed on a revenue-producing activity between a seller and a customer, and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes. EITF 06-3 concluded that the presentation of taxes within its scope on either a gross
included in revenue and cost or 
42 Table of Contents 
net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision subject to appropriate disclosure. EITF 06-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2006. We currently present these taxes on a gross basis and will begin the required disclosures of these taxes in fiscal 2007. In
July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions as described in
SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and requires a company to recognize, in its financial statements, the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis
solely on the technical merit of the position. In addition, FIN 48 requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures including a discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next twelve months as
well as a roll-forward of all unrecognized tax benefits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006; we will adopt FIN 48 as of January1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact
on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements
SFAS 157, which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop
those assumptions. Under SFAS 157, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. ADTRAN is currently evaluating the
impact SFAS 157 might have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB 108 provides interpretive guidance on how the effects
of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. The SEC staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and
evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and there was
no impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Note 2Stock Incentive Plans Stock Option Program Descriptions Our Board of Directors adopted the
1996 Employees Incentive Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan effective February14, 1996, as amended, under which 170million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive
stock options and non-qualified stock options. Options granted under the 1996 Plan become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four or five-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of
the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. The 1996 Plan expired February14, 2006 and expiration dates of options outstanding at December31, 2006 under the 1996 Plan range from 2007 to 2016. On January23, 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan, which reserves 130million shares of
common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at
our annual meeting of stockholders held on May9, 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding at December31, 2006 under the 2006 Plan are in the year 2016. Our stockholders approved the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan Directors Plan on May18, 2005, under which 400thousand shares of common stock have been reserved. The Directors Plan is a formula plan to
provide options to our non-employee directors. Options granted under the Directors Plan normally become exercisable on the first anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. We currently have options outstanding under the
1995 Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended, which expired October31, 2005. Expiration dates of options outstanding under both plans at December31, 2006 range from 2007 to 2016.

At December31, 2006, 124million options were available for grant under the shareholder approved plans. The aggregate intrinsic values in the
table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value the difference between ADTRANs closing stock price on the last trading day of 2006 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options that would have been received
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December31, 2006. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRANs stock. The total pretax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006 was $51 million. The fair value of options vesting during 2006 was $47 million. Stock-Based Compensation On January1, 2006, ADTRAN adopted
SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes APB
No25, which we previously applied, for periods beginning in fiscal 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107 relating to SFAS 123R. We have applied the provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R. ADTRAN adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the
first day of our fiscal 2006 year. Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our Consolidated Statements
of Income for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. New awards are valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption. Prior outstanding stock option awards that were not fully vested as of December31, 2005
will be recognized as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income over their remaining requisite service periods based on their previously established fair values. 
44 Table of Contents Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, ADTRAN recorded the intrinsic value of stock-based compensation as expense, in
accordance with APB No25, as allowed under SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, no material amounts of stock-based compensation expense had been recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income prior to January1, 2006, other
than as related to accelerated vesting at retirement, because the exercise price of the majority of our stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. In our pro forma disclosures required under
SFAS 123, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date
of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest will be recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock-based compensation
expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December31, 2006 includes compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December31, 2005 based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to December31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards is recognized using the ratable single-option approach. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended
December31, 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. As such, we evaluated the need to record a cumulative effect adjustment for estimated forfeitures upon the adoption of SFAS 123R. Because this adjustment only applies to the extent that compensation
cost was previously recognized for the unvested awards, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded upon adoption. ADTRAN uses the Black-Scholes option
pricing model the Black-Scholes Model for the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant under SFAS 123R. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that
involve judgment. Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, existing models may not provide
reliable measures of fair value of our stock options. We have used third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in our Black-Scholes Model. We will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated
fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies, which may materially impact our fair value determination. ADTRAN has elected to adopt the alternative transition method, as permitted by FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the
Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R for those awards that were outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method allows the use of
simplified methods to calculate the beginning capital-in-excess-of-par pool related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact of the tax effects of stock-based compensation awards on the
capital-in-excess-of-par pool and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we reported all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. SFAS 123R requires cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the related compensation cost recognized in the financial statements excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. In accordance with
SFAS 123R, excess tax benefits recognized in periods after the adoption date have been properly classified as financing cash flows. Excess tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the adoption date are classified as operating cash flows.
Valuation and Expense Information The following table
summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options under SFAS 123R for the year ended December31, 2006, which was allocated as follows:  December31,2006 Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of sales 399 Selling, general and administrative 3,945 Research and development 3,794 Stock-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 7,739 Total stock-based compensation expense 8,138 Tax benefit 971 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax 7,167 
45 Table of Contents At December31, 2006, total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized was
approximately $217 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 28 years on a weighted average basis. The fair value of ADTRANs
options was estimated using the Black-Scholes Model. This model requires the input of assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables that will usually have a significant impact on the fair value estimate. These variables include,
but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee exercise behaviors. The assumptions and variables used for the current period grants were developed based on SFAS 123R and SEC guidance contained in SAB 107. There were no
material changes made during 2006 to the methodology used to determine the assumptions. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted
to employees and directors during the twelve months ended December31, 2006 was $933 per share using the Black-Scholes Model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  2006 Expected volatility
4740 Risk-free interest rate
458 Expected dividend yield
158 Expected life in years
490
We based our estimate of expected volatility for the twelve months ended December31, 2006 on the sequential
historical daily trading data of our common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the options granted. The selection of the historical volatility approach was based on available data indicating our historical volatility is as equally
representative of ADTRANs future stock price trends as is implied volatility. We have no reason to believe the future volatility of our stock price is likely to differ from its past volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds on the date of grant having a remaining term equal to the expected
life of the options granted. The dividend yield is based on our historical and expected dividend payouts. The expected life of our stock options is based
upon historical exercise and cancellation activity of our previous stock-based grants with a ten-year contractual term. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December31, 2006 is based on options ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. These estimates were based upon historical
experience. We expect our forfeiture rate to be approximately 2% annually. Pro Forma Information Under SFAS 123 for Periods Prior to January1,
2006 Stock-based compensation expense of $03 million, net of tax, was recorded in the twelve month period ended December31, 2005 relating to the
accelerated vesting of stock options for retiring personnel. The table below illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we had

deposit and $26 million of deferred compensation plan assets. Restricted investments at December31, 2005 consist of $500 million invested in a restricted certificate of deposit and $24 million of deferred compensation plan assets.
At December31, 2006 and 2005, we held $477 million and $916 million, respectively, of auction rate municipal bonds classified as
available-for-sale short-term investments. Our investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates, which typically reset every seven, 28, or 35 days. Despite the long-term
nature of their stated contractual maturities, we generally have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities. As a result, we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from these investments.
All income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income. We review our investment portfolio for potential
other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate
charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical decline
in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value
that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by 25% for more than six months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. The year ended
December31, 2006 included charges of $01 million related to the impairment of certain publicly traded equity securities. There were no such charges in 2005 or 2004. Gross realized gains on the sale of securities were approximately $14 million, $19 million and $38 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross realized losses on the sale
of securities were approximately $01 million, $04 million and $20 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, 
47 Table of Contents 
we had net unrealized gains on our investments of $35 million and $70 million, respectively. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, we had $07 million and
$09 million, respectively of unrealized losses with durations greater than 12 months. The fair values of investments with unrealized losses were $1345 million and $1341 million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also invest in privately held companies and private equity funds and record these investments at cost or impaired cost. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, we had
$31 million and $26 million, respectively, of investments carried at cost or impaired cost. These investments are included in long-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We review these investments periodically in order
to determine if circumstances both financial and non-financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment. Impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would
reasonably expect to receive in an arms length sale of the investment. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recognized gross losses of $0, $0 and $01 million, respectively, on cost basis investments. During the year ended December31, 2004, we received $10 million for investments that were classified as held-to-maturity and had previously been written down to
$03 million. These transactions resulted in a net realized gain of $07 million and were the result of the sale of our investment in a private company. We have committed to invest an aggregate of up to $79 million in two private equity funds, of which $63 million has been invested to date. The duration of each of these commitments is ten years, with remaining commitments of $03 million
expiring in 2010 and $13 million expiring in 2012. This investment is included in our total available-for-sale investments and is classified in long-term investments in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Note 4Inventory At December31, 2006 and 2005, inventory

Note 6Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing and Economic Incentives In conjunction with an expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of Alabama
Industrial Development Authority the Authority. Pursuant to the program, on January13, 1995, the Authority issued $200 million of its taxable revenue bonds and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to ADTRAN. The bonds
were originally purchased by AmSouth Bank of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama the Bank. Wachovia Bank, N.A., Nashville, Tennessee formerly First Union National Bank of Tennessee the Bondholder, purchased the original bonds
from the Bank and made further advances to the Authority, bringing the total amount outstanding to $500 million. An Amended and Restated Taxable Revenue Bond Amended and Restated Bond was issued and the original financing agreement
was amended. The Amended and Restated Bond bears interest, payable monthly. The interest rate is 5%. The Amended and Restated Bond matures on 
48 Table of Contents 
January1, 2020. The estimated market value of the bond at December31, 2006 was approximately $475 million. We are required to make payments to
the Authority in amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Amended and Restated Bond. Included in long-term investments is $495 million which is invested in a restricted certificate of deposit. These funds serve as collateral
deposit against the principal of this bond. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that reduce the amount of payroll withholdings that we are required to remit to the state
for those employment positions that qualify under the program. Our economic incentives realized for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $14 million, $14 million and $13 million, respectively. Due to continued positive cash flow from operating activities, ADTRAN made a business decision to begin an early partial redemption of the bond as evidenced by a $05
million principal payment in the third quarter of 2006. It is our intent to make annual principal payments of between $05 million and $50 million per year in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $07
million of the bond debt has been reclassified to a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 7Income Taxes A summary of the components of the provision for income taxes as of December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:  In thousands

49 Table of Contents We have state research tax credit carry-forwards of $12 million which will expire between 2016 and 2020. In accordance
with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset arising from these credits, and accordingly, have provided a valuation allowance. We do
not provide for U.S. income tax on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations, whose earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. For years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, foreign profits before income taxes were not
material. During 2004, we settled prior year state tax contingencies, resulting in an additional $10 million of state tax expense. We also realized
additional research and development credits from prior years in the year ending December31, 2004. During 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit of $16 million as an adjustment to equity in accordance with SFAS 123R. During 2005 and 2004, we
recorded an income tax benefit of $80 million and $30 million, respectively, as an adjustment to equity in accordance with APB 25. This benefit is calculated on the difference between the exercise price of stock option exercises and the market
price of the underlying common stock upon exercise. For the year ended December31, 2006, approximately 86% of the income tax benefit relates to disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options and 14% relates to non-qualified stock
options. Note 8Employee Benefit Plans 401k Savings Plan We maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401k Retirement Plan the Savings Plan for the benefit of eligible
employees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401a and 401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code, and is intended to be a safe harbor 401k plan under Code
Section401k12. The Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The plan also requires us to contribute a safe harbor amount each year
equal to 3% of compensation for eligible employees who have completed a year of service by the end of the year. In calculating our contribution, we only use compensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code $220,000 for 2006. All
contributions under the Savings Plan are 100% vested. Charges to operations for employer contributions and plan administration for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $33 million, $28 million and $27 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan We
maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401k plan and is available to our officers who have been duly elected by our Board of
Directors. The deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a portion of their salaries and annual bonuses, and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis, without the limitations that apply to the 401k
plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. All contributions are unfunded and are credited to bookkeeping accounts for the participants. However, we have set aside assets in a rabbi trust Trust to help
us pay the benefits under this plan. The Trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are invested in pre-approved mutual funds as directed by each participant, and the
participants account is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments. None of the Trust assets are invested in shares of ADTRAN common stock. Benefits are usually distributed after termination of employment, or at
age 65 if elected by the participant, in a single lump sum cash payment. We account for the Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with EITF Abstract 97-14, Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned are Held in a
Rabbi Trust and Invested. Assets of the Trust are invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market
instruments. These mutual funds are publicly quoted and reported at market value. We account for these investments in accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The market value of the
assets held by the Trust and the amounts payable to the plan participants are as follows:  In thousands

income in the accompanying 2006 Consolidated Statement of Income. Increases or decreases in the market value of the deferred compensation liability are included as selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying 2006 and 2005
Consolidated Statement of Income. Based on the changes in the total market value of the Trusts assets, we recorded deferred compensation adjustments in 2006 and 2005 of $3 million and $02 million, respectively. Retiree Medical Coverage We provide medical, dental and
prescription drug coverage to two retired former officers and their spouses, for life, on the same terms as provided to our active officers. In addition, upon the death of the former officers, their spouses will be eligible to continue coverage for
up to 30 years. This liability totaled $147 thousand and $125 thousand at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Note 9Segment
Information and Major Customers ADTRAN operates two reportable segments: 1Carrier Networks Division and 2Enterprise Networks Division.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies see Note 1 to the extent that such policies affect the reported segment information. We evaluate the performance
of our segments based on gross profit; therefore, selling, general and administrative costs, as well as research and development, other income, interest income/expense, net realized investment gains losses and provision for taxes, are reported on
an entity-wide basis only. There are no inter-segment revenues. The following table presents information about the reported sales and gross profit of our
reportable segments for each of the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 reconciled to net income. Asset information by reportable segment is not reported, since we do not produce such information internally.  Sales by Market Segment In thousands
