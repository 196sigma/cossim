-49 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Encore Medical Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Encore Medical Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Encore Medical Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Encore Medical Corporations internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated March14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Austin, Texas
March14, 2005 -50 Table of Contents Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our chief executive
officer and our chief financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, using the criteria set forth in the Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting is effective as of December31, 2004. KPMG LLP, our independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on managements assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. The scope of our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
includes the Companys consolidated subsidiaries except for Empi, Inc. and its subsidiaries Empi,
a material business acquired by the Company on October4, 2004. The Companys consolidated net
sales for the year ended December31, 2004 were approximately $1635million, of which Empi
represented approximately $414million. The Companys consolidated total assets as of December
31, 2004 were approximately $5521million, of which Empi represented approximately $1072million. 51 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Encore Medical
Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Encore Medical Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Encore Medical Corporations management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Encore Medical Corporation maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion,
Encore Medical Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Encore Medical Corporation acquired Empi, Inc. and subsidiaries Empi on October4, 2004, and
management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Encore Medical Corporations
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, Empis internal control over
financial reporting associated with total assets of $1072million, and total revenues of $414
million included in the consolidated financial statements of Encore Medical Corporation and
subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December31, 2004. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of Encore Medical Corporation also excluded an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of Empi. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Encore Medical Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, and our report dated March14, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Austin, Texas

CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
dollars in thousands, except per share data 1.Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Encore Medical
Corporation we, our, us, Encore, or the Company, a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned
subsidiaries and those entities in which we hold a controlling interest. We are a
diversified orthopedic company that designs, manufactures, markets and distributes a comprehensive
range of high quality orthopedic devices including surgical implants, products for orthopedic
rehabilitation, pain management and physical therapy, and sports medicine equipment. Our products
are used primarily by orthopedic surgeons, physical and occupational therapists, athletic trainers,
and other healthcare specialists who treat patients with musculoskeletal conditions resulting from
degenerative diseases, deformities, and sports-related injuries. Our non-invasive medical devices
and related accessories are primarily used by patients for at-home therapy. We currently market and
distribute our products through two operating divisions, our Surgical Implant Division and our
Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division. Our Surgical Implant Division offers reconstructive joint
products, including hip, knee, shoulder and spinal implants for the orthopedic surgical market. Our
Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division offers non-invasive medical products that are used before and
after surgery to assist in the repair and rehabilitation of soft tissue and bone, and to protect
against further injury; electrotherapy devices and accessories used to treat pain and restore
muscle function; iontophoretic devices and accessories used to deliver medication; clinical therapy
tables and traction equipment; and orthotics devices used to treat joint and spine conditions. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly owned subsidiaries,
and those subsidiaries in which we own a controlling interest. Minority interest reflects the 50%
separate ownership of Medireha GmbH. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash consists of deposits with financial institutions. We consider all highly liquid investments
with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents. While our cash and cash
equivalents are on deposit with high-quality institutions, such deposits exceed FDIC insured
limits. Investments Investments consist of government securities with readily determinable fair values and original
maturities in excess of three months. We account for our investment instruments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities. The short-term investments are treated as held to
maturity under SFAS No115 and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, due
to the short period of time to maturity. Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts
We must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable. In doing so, management
analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Sales Returns, Rebates and Allowances We must make estimates of the amount of sales returns, rebates and allowances that will eventually
be granted. In doing so, management analyzes sales programs that are in effect, contractual
arrangements, market acceptance and historical trends when evaluating
the adequacy of sales returns, rebates and allowances accounts. Inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being average cost. We
establish reserves for such issues as slow moving and excess inventory, product obsolescence and
valuation impairment. For all divisions, we utilize a specific identification methodology. In
addition, sales performance is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis to determine 57 Table of Contents the amounts that should be adjusted to the existing reserve. The reserved inventory items are
primarily being disposed of by scrapping or donating to charitable organizations. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets that range from three to thirty-nine years. Leasehold
improvements and assets subject to capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over
the terms of the leases or lives of the assets, if shorter. We capitalize surgical implant
instruments that we provide to surgeons, free of charge, for use while implanting our products and
the related depreciation expense is recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative
expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized Software Software is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is amortized using the straight-line
method over its estimated useful life ranging from 3 to 5years. During the software application
development stage, capitalized costs include external consulting costs, cost of software licenses,
and internal payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with a
software project. Software assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets.
Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if they result in added functionality which enable the
software to perform tasks it was previously incapable of performing. Software maintenance,
training and data conversion costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future net
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Intangible assets consist of
agency rights, transferable licenses, distribution networks, intellectual property, non-compete
agreements and customer lists and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization
of intangibles is computed using the straight-line method over periods ranging from one to
thirty-eight years. On an annual basis, and between annual tests in certain circumstances, we
review our goodwill and intangible assets to determine if there has been any change in the useful
lives of goodwill or intangible assets, or whether there has been impairment of these assets. Shipping and Handling Costs The portion of shipping and handling costs which are not reimbursed by customers is included in
selling, general and administrative expense. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 19million, $18million and $23million of shipping and handling costs, respectively, were
included in selling, general and administrative expenses. All remaining shipping and handling
expenses, which are reimbursed by customers, are included as part of net sales and cost of sales. Revenue Recognition Our Surgical Implant Divisions products are sold through a network of independent sales
representatives in the U.S. and distributors outside the U.S. Revenues from sales made by
independent sales representatives, who are paid commissions upon the ultimate sale of the products,
are recorded at the time the product is utilized in a surgical procedure implanted into a patient
and a purchase order is received from the hospital. Revenues from sales to customers outside the
U.S. are recorded when the product is shipped to the customer. The distributors, who sell the
products to other customers, take title to the products, have no rights of return and assume the
risk for credit and obsolescence. Distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms
regardless of when they sell the products. In addition, there is no price protection. We sell our Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division products through a variety of distribution channels.
We sell our clinical rehabilitation products to dealers. We sell our soft goods products to
distributors, retail outlets and various medical and sports establishments. For both of these
channels, we record sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer. Customers take title
to the products, assume credit and product obsolescence risks, must pay within specified periods
regardless of when they sell or use the products and have no price protection except for
distributors who participate in our rebate program. For our home therapy products, we recognize
wholesale revenue when we ship our products to our 58 Table of Contents wholesale customers. We recognize retail revenue, both rental and purchase, when our product has
been dispensed to the patient and the patients insurance has been verified. For retail products
that are sold from our inventories consigned at clinic locations, we recognize revenue when we
receive notice that the device has been prescribed and dispensed to the patient and the insurance
has been verified or preauthorization from the insurance company has been obtained, when required. We must make estimates of potential future product returns, rebates and other allowances related to
current period product revenue. To do so, our management analyzes historical returns, current
economic trends, and changes in customer demand and contractual terms when evaluating the adequacy
of the sales returns and other allowances. Significant management judgment must be used and
estimates must be made in connection with establishing the sales returns, rebates and other
allowances in any accounting period. Provisions for product returns, rebates and other allowances
are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Warranty Costs We provide expressed warranties on certain products, principally within our Orthopedic
Rehabilitation Division. The warranty periods typically range from one to two years, and provide
for customer return rights relative to defective product. At each reporting period, we estimate
our warranty obligations based upon historical experience and known product issues, if any.

Advertising Costs We expense advertising costs as they are incurred. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, such costs
approximated $20million, $13million, and $12million, respectively. Research and Development Research and development expenses primarily relate to the technological development and enhancement
of reconstructive and spinal devices, as well as rehabilitation products. Research and development
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized and measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to be recognized. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings lossper common share has been computed using the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period and excludes any dilutive effects of options,
warrants, restricted stock or the conversion of the SeriesA Preferred Stock. Diluted earnings
lossper share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock and common stock
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from
the computation if their effect is anti-dilutive. The number of common share equivalents
outstanding is computed using the treasury stock method. Foreign Currency Translation Our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency, which is
predominately the Euro. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars
using the period-end exchange rate. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average
exchange rate during the period. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses are reported in earnings as realized. Derivatives and Hedging Activities We use derivative financial instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates and interest rates. We evaluate the amount at risk, risk tolerance, cost of the
derivative, and our targeted mix of fixed and floating rates before entering into hedging
activities. Generally we use forward contracts to hedge foreign currency cash flows and interest
rate swaps to hedge interest expense, both of which are deemed highly effective in hedging
fluctuations in the 59 Table of Contents associated rates. Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Gains
and losses that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income and are only reported in current income when rate fluctuations of the hedged
items are reported. Any ineffective portion of the derivatives change in fair value is directly
recognized in current income. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or
trading purposes. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents,
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair values due to their
short-term nature. We estimate the fair value of our long-term fixed rate debt based on our
current borrowing rate for debt with similar maturities, terms and characteristics. At December31,
2004 and 2003, the carrying value of our long-term debt approximated fair value. Acquisitions On October4, 2004, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Empi,
Inc. Empi, a privately held Minnesota corporation, pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement
dated August8, 2004. The total purchase price was $3698million. See Note 13 for additional
information regarding the Empi acquisition. On February8, 2002, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Chattanooga Group, Inc. We acquired the stock for a total purchase price of $368million. See
Note 14 for additional information regarding the Chattanooga Group acquisition. Stock-based Compensation Plans We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosures as well as those outlined in SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS 148 and SFAS 123, we
continue to apply the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for our plans. Accordingly,
compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price
of our stock at the date of the grant, over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
Stock based awards for non-employees are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No123 and
Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus 96-18. Had compensation cost for all stock option grants been determined based on their fair value at the
grant dates, consistent with the method prescribed by SFAS 148 and SFAS 123, our net income loss
and earnings lossper share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below

income refers to unrealized gains and losses that are excluded from current earnings and are
recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. These gains and losses often fluctuate
before being realized, and are often long-term in nature. The Companys other comprehensive income
is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized interest rate hedge gains
and losses, net of tax. Activity in accumulated other comprehensive income during the years ended

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which
revises SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No123R amends SFAS 123 to require all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in
the income statement based on their fair values. Compensation expense is to be charged during the
vesting period. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The new standard will become
effective for us in our third quarter of 2005. We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of SFAS 123R and the impact it will have on our financial position and results of
operations. In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory Costs. This Statement amends the guidance in
ARB No43 Chapter4 Inventory Pricing, to require items such as idle facility costs, excessive
spoilage, double freight and rehandling costs to be expensed in the current period, regardless if
they are abnormal amounts or not. This Statement will become effective for us in the first quarter
of 2006. The adoption of SFAS No151 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 2.Investments We invest our excess cash in U.S. treasury securities. These are items with readily determinable
fair values and original maturities in excess of three months, but less than twelve months. All
investments have been classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. As of December31, 2004 and
2003 we had investments with fair values and amortized costs of approximately $0 and $35million,
respectively. 61 Table of Contents 3.Accounts Receivable A summary of activity in our accounts receivable reserves for doubtful accounts, sales returns,

The market value of our debt approximates the carrying value as of December31, 2004. This was
determined using factors that included recent trade prices on fixed rate notes, prevailing interest
rates and the variable rate feature of the senior credit facility. The debt agreements related to the $180million senior credit facility and the $165million senior
subordinated notes payable contain warranties and covenants and require maintenance of certain
financial ratios. Default on any warranty or covenant could affect the ability to borrow under the
agreements and, if not waived or corrected, could accelerate the maturity of any borrowings
outstanding under the applicable agreements. As of the date of this report, we are in 65 Table of Contents compliance with all debt covenants and warranties. In addition, these debt agreements restrict our
ability to iincur additional indebtedness; iiissue redeemable equity interests and preferred
equity interests; iiipay dividends or make distributions, repurchase equity interests or make
other restricted payments; ivmake capital expenditures; vcreate liens; vienter into
transactions with our affiliates; viimake investments; viiisell assets; or ixenter into
mergers or consolidations. As of September2003, we repaid in full all principal amounts then outstanding under our $25
million credit facility and our $24million senior subordinated notes payable in conjunction with
the public offering we completed on August11, 2003. See Note 9 for additional detail regarding
this offering. In connection with the repayment, we recorded a charge due to the early repayment
of our outstanding debt, totaling $77million. All but approximately $650 of this amount
represented a non-cash expense for unamortized warrant and debt issue costs. In connection with the original $24million senior subordinated notes payable, we granted a warrant
to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,198,614 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $001
per share. This warrant was originally valued at $6,596 and recorded as a reduction of long-term
debt. In connection with the repayment of this original debt, we expensed the remaining
unamortized balance of this warrant during 2003. All of these warrants have been exercised. On October4, 2004, all amounts outstanding under our $25million credit facility which was $0
and our $24million senior subordinated notes payable which was $5million were paid in full and
those debt agreements were terminated. On March1, 2004, we acquired an exclusive license to manufacture and sell products incorporating a
patented implant design and mechanism for a total purchase price of $709. In connection with this
acquisition, we issued a $250 note to the holders of the patents. Payments under this note are due
in quarterly installments equal to 6% of our net sales of products utilizing this technology. The
interest rate under this note will be adjusted annually to equal the New York prime rate. All
unpaid principal and interest under this note shall be due March1, 2009. A note payable by Empi for the acquisition of Rehab MedEquip, which occurred in 2002, was assumed
with the acquisition of Empi. The note bears interest of the greater of 5% or the prime rate per
annum, payable monthly. As of December31, 2004, the interest rate on the note was 525%. At December31, 2004, the aggregate amounts of annual principal maturities of long-term debt and

9.Capital Stock Preferred Stock Preferred stock may be issued from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors the
Board with such designation, rights and preferences as the Board may determine. The preferred
stock may have dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that may be more expansive
than the rights of the holders of the common stock. At December31, 2004, we have 1,000,000 shares
of authorized preferred stock, of which 255,000 shares have been designated SeriesA Preferred
Stock. On June12, 2001, we issued 132,353 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock for net proceeds of
approximately $128million. The 132,353 shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock were immediately
convertible into 13,235,300 shares of our common stock. On January24, 2003, 750 shares of Series
A Preferred Stock were converted into 75,000 shares of common stock. On August11, 2003, 131,603
shares of SeriesA Preferred Stock, representing all of the remaining outstanding shares of our
SeriesA Preferred Stock, were converted into 13,160,300 shares of common stock. Common Stock On August11, 2003 we sold a total of 10,637,500 shares of our common stock at $400 per share in a
public offering. This offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately $426million. We
used the net offering proceeds of approximately $390million to repay $259million indebtedness
under our senior subordinated notes payable to CapitalSource Finance LLC, $20million of the term
loan debt under our senior credit facility with Bank of America, $106million to repay our
outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility which was part of our senior credit
facility with Bank of America, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. On December17, 2003 we sold 6,000,000 shares of our common stock at $625 per share in a public
offering. This offering generated total gross proceeds of approximately $375million $345
million net offering proceeds, which was used for working capital and as a portion of the cash
purchase price component of the acquisition of Empi. On October4, 2004, we issued 8,000,000 shares of our common stock to Empi common stockholders and
option holders as a component of the purchase price for Empi. These shares were valued at $351
million, based on a $439 per share average closing price of Encores common stock on the Nasdaq
National Market for the period from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Empi
acquisition. Stock Option Plans We have seven stock option plans. All options granted under the plans are exercisable for common
stock in Encore as described below. Non-employee stock compensation expense was approximately
$135, $155 and $265 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The 1996 Incentive Stock Plan provides for the grant of a variety of equity related awards,
including, but not limited to, incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock, to key employees of Encore and its subsidiaries. The
1997 Distributor Advisory Panel Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of stock options to those
persons or entities that are our or our subsidiaries sales representatives and distributors of our
products. The 1997 Surgeon Advisory Panel Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of stock
options to those surgeons who are serving as members of our, or our subsidiaries, surgeon advisory
panel. The 2000 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of options to
non-employee directors of Encore. The 2004 Empi Stock Option Plan includes incentive stock options
and non-qualified stock options available for grant to employees of Empi, who joined our company as
a result of the acquisition of Empi. 67 Table of Contents In addition, we have two stock option plans under which we are no longer issuing new options but
which have outstanding options. The 1993 Distributor Stock Option Plan provided for the grant of
stock options to those who were our subsidiaries sales representatives and distributors of our
products, and the 1993 Surgeon Advisory Panel Stock Option Plan provided for the grant of stock
options to those who were serving as members of our subsidiaries surgeon advisory panel. The stock options granted under all of these plans are generally granted at fair value on the date
of grant, vest ratably over a predefined period and expire no more than 10years from the date of
grant. At December31, 2004, we had reserved a total of 7,559,051 shares of common stock for the
plans. During 2004, we accelerated the vesting of certain Company stock options granted to employees under
the 1996 Incentive Stock Plan that had a per share option exercise price equal to or greater than
$728. The minimum $728 per share exercise price was greater than the closing price of the
Companys shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the effective date of the acceleration. As a result,
options to purchase approximately 773,500 shares of the Companys common stock with varying
remaining vesting schedules of between 4months and 32months, became immediately exercisable. This
acceleration was made considering long-term incentive compensation arrangements. Because the
exercise price was above the market price, no expense was recorded at the modification date. A summary of the activity in our stock option plans is presented below

Warrants On February8, 2002, in connection with the financing for the acquisition of Chattanooga Group,
Inc., we issued a warrant to CapitalSource Holdings LLC, giving it the right to acquire for a
period of five years up to 2,198,614 shares of our common stock. On August14, 2003, we exercised
our right to prepay $6million of the principal amount of senior subordinated notes. Because we
exercised this right, CapitalSource conveyed warrants to purchase 549,653 shares of our common
stock to the Galen Entities. On October20, 2003, CapitalSource exercised all of its remaining
warrants for 1,648,961 shares of common stock. On October2, 2004, the Galen Entities exercised
all of its warrants for 549,653 shares of common stock. Therefore, at December31, 2004 there were
no warrants outstanding. Issuance of Common Stock for Recourse Notes Payable In June2001, the Company sold approximately 12million shares of common stock at $102 per share
to certain executives of the Company. In exchange for the common stock, the Company accepted
promissory notes from the employees totaling $1,187, which bear interest at 8% per annum. The
promissory notes were initially collateralized by the 12million shares of common stock and are
full recourse to the assets of the executives. The notes have been recorded as a component of
stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet. In 2004 and 2003, we received $152 and
$64, respectively, in note payments from former employees. During 2002, 22,222 shares of common
stock were repurchased by the Company at a price of $102 per share pursuant to the restricted
stock agreements and the related promissory notes were reduced accordingly. As of December31,
2004, $239 of the promissory notes had been repaid and 234,314 shares of common stock had been
released from collateral. 10.Segment and Geographic Information We have two reportable segments as defined by SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. Our reportable segments are business units that
offer different products that are managed separately because each business requires different
manufacturing and marketing strategies. The Surgical Implant Division sells reconstructive
products including knee, hip, shoulder and spinal implants. The Orthopedic Rehabilitation Division
offers non-invasive medical products that are used before and after surgery to assist in the repair
and rehabilitation of soft tissue and bone, and to protect against further injury; electrotherapy
devices and accessories used to treat pain and restore muscle function; iontophoretic devices and
accessories used to deliver medication; clinical therapy tables and traction equipment; and
orthotics devices used to treat joint and spine conditions. 69 Table of Contents Information regarding business segments is as follows

We allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our segments based on gross margin and
therefore have not disclosed certain other items, such as interest, depreciation and income taxes
as permitted by SFAS 131. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We do not allocate assets to
reportable segments because certain of our property and equipment are shared by all of our
segments. Geographic Area We have added a European-based operation in 2004 through the acquisition of Empi on October4,
2004. Prior to 2004, our international sales were primarily to a few foreign distributors, of
which no one distributor accounted for at least 10% of our total net sales during such periods. Following are our net sales by geographic area

In connection with our acquisitions of Empi in 2004 and Chattanooga in 2002 see Notes 13 and
14, we assumed net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $252million and $46million,
respectively, which consisted principally of the differences for book and tax purposes of the
acquired intangible assets. -71 Table of Contents At December31, 2004 we maintain approximately $84million in state net operating loss
carryforwards, which expire over a period of 5 to 20years. Our European net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $43million generally are not subject to expiration dates, unless
certain events are triggered by the Company. We also maintain a charitable contribution
carryforward of approximately $717, which expires in 2007. In assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon us attaining future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based upon managements
projections of future taxable income and the periods and manner in which our deferred tax assets
will be available, management estimates that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred
tax assets will be available to offset future taxable income. As such, no valuation allowance has
been provided against the deferred tax asset balance at December31, 2004 and 2003. 12.Earnings Per Share Following is a reconciliation of the basic and diluted per share computations

Because we incurred a net loss for the year ended December31, 2003, 11,586,456 common stock
equivalents were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
inclusion of such would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2002 the
effect of 911,700 and 5,908,906 common stock equivalents, respectively, were excluded as
anti-dilutive. -72 Table of Contents 13.Acquisition of Empi, Inc. On October4, 2004, we acquired Empi, a privately held Minnesota corporation. We believe with this
acquisition, the combined company creates the first orthopedic product company that provides a
comprehensive continuum of products for the needs of orthopedic surgical and rehabilitative
patients. The total purchase price of approximately $3698million was comprised of approximately
$1728million payable to the Empi common stockholders and option holders in cash, along with eight
million shares of our common stock, plus the repayment of approximately $1549million of
outstanding Empi debt plus $70million in purchase costs. Empi became a wholly owned subsidiary of
Encore Medical IHC, Inc., a direct subsidiary of Encore Medical Corporation, pursuant to the terms
of a merger agreement dated August8, 2004. We funded the merger, which we refer to as the Empi
acquisition, with proceeds from the offering of $165million of senior subordinated notes, from
borrowings under a new $180million senior credit facility see Note 8 and from available cash.
These proceeds and borrowings were also used to repay substantially all of Encores and Empis
existing debt and to pay all the related fees and expenses of the Empi acquisition. The fair value of the Encore common stock issued of $351million was determined as $439 per share
based upon the average closing price of Encores common stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the
period from two days before to two days after the announcement of the Empi acquisition. The cash portion of the acquisition consideration is subject to adjustment based upon an audited
balance sheet as of the closing date. The parties have paid into an escrow account $5million of
the cash portion of the acquisition consideration to fund any downward post-closing adjustments.
The eight million shares of Encores common stock representing the stock portion of the
consideration paid to Empi stockholders are being held in escrow for up to one year after closing
to secure indemnification claims that may be asserted by us. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to the acquired
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and the assumed liabilities of Empi based upon their
estimated fair values as of the date of the merger. The following represents the allocation of the
aggregate purchase price as of October4, 2004. For certain of the assets acquired inventory,
fixed assets, intangible assets fair value was estimated based upon third party appraisals. For
the remaining assets and liabilities, book value was deemed to approximate fair value due to the
nature of the assets and liabilities. The following valuations are preliminary and are subject to
change

It is anticipated that a closing tax benefit was generated upon completion of the Empi acquisition.
We shall file for the related refunds and, as additional Empi acquisition consideration, shall pay
to the stockholders of Empi, on a pro rata basis, the lesser of $6million or the full amount of
any such granted refunded taxes. This contingent consideration has not been included within the
estimate of the purchase price. Upon resolution of the contingency, any additional amounts paid to
the Empi stockholders would increase goodwill accordingly. The acquired intangible assets consist of the following, and are being amortized over their

14.Acquisition of Chattanooga Group, Inc. On February8, 2002, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Chattanooga Group, Inc. Chattanooga pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement for a cash purchase
price of $351million. In order to finance this acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement
with Bank of America, N.A. for maximum borrowings up to $30million and a note agreement with
CapitalSource Finance LLC for $24million. The total purchase price paid for Chattanooga approximating $368million, included cash payments
of $351million and acquisition costs of $17million, and was allocated as follows based upon the

In connection with this acquisition and financing, we repaid the outstanding balances of certain
Chattanooga debt totaling approximately $5million. We also repaid all amounts outstanding under
our then current revolving credit facility, which approximated $66million, with proceeds from a
similar revolving credit facility as part of the Bank of America Credit Agreement. -74 Table of Contents 15.Derivative Instruments We make use of debt financing as a source of funds and are therefore exposed to interest rate
fluctuation in the normal course of our business. We operate internationally and are therefore
exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business. As
part of our risk management strategy, we use derivative instruments to hedge portions of our
exposure. Before acquiring a derivative instrument to hedge a specific risk, potential natural
hedges are evaluated. Derivative instruments are only utilized to manage underlying exposures that
arise from our business operations and are not used for speculative purposes. Factors considered in
the decision to hedge an underlying market exposure include the materiality of the risk, the
volatility of the market, the duration of the hedge, and the availability, effectiveness and cost
of derivative instruments. Our $180million credit facility is subject to a floating interest rate. We manage the risk of
unfavorable movements in interest rates by hedging a portion of the outstanding loan balance.
Interest rate swap agreements were entered into in which we pay fixed rate interest on a
predetermined amount and receive floating rate interest in return. This reduces the effect of
rising interest rates, thereby making interest expense more predictable. As of December31, 2004,
we had two agreements in place, each for a notional amount of $25million, expiring in 2006 and
2007, respectively. Under these agreements we pay a fixed rate of 364% and receive a variable
rate equal to the current one month Eurodollar rate. The fair value of derivative financial instruments recorded on the balance sheet as of December31,
2004 was $269 and is recorded in other non-current liabilities. Derivative losses on our interest
rate swap agreements of $71, on a pre-tax basis, were included in interest expense in fiscal year
2004. If short-term interest rates were to remain at the December31, 2004 levels, we estimate that
$110 of pre-tax derivative losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income will be
reclassified into earnings within the next fiscal year ending December31, 2005. Derivative gains
and losses that qualify as accounting hedges are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income
lossnet of tax, until such time as they are reported along with the hedged item. By the nature of our international operations, we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency
rates. We manage potential negative effects of exchange rate fluctuations by entering into hedging
transactions in the form of forward exchange contracts, options or similar agreements. These
transactions historically have not qualified as accounting hedges, and accordingly, the gains and
losses from these derivatives are recorded in results of operations as they occur. Our U.S.
operations are subject to risk associated with international currency exchange rates on purchases
of inventory from a small number of suppliers. Our German subsidiary, whose functional currency is
Euros, is billed for certain inventory in U.S. Dollars. Our German subsidiary utilizes
international currency derivatives to limit their risk to currency fluctuations. These derivatives
are in the form of forward currency contracts used to manage currency fluctuation on purchases of
inventory that is denominated in U.S. Dollars. There were no derivatives in place prior to 2004. -75 Table of Contents 16.Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Data

17.Related Party Transactions During the first quarter of 2004, in accordance with Section16b of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, we received $288 from a greater than 10% stockholder and its affiliates, which represented
a short-swing profit under Section16 of the Exchange Act. The funds were earned when shares of
our stock were sold by this stockholder and its affiliates in our December2003 public offering,
which was within six months of the date the stockholders received warrants to acquire shares of our
stock. The amounts received were recorded as an increase to additional paid-in capital. On October4, 2004, we paid Galen Advisors LLC $1million as a consulting fee in connection with
our acquisition of Empi. This payment resulted from a consulting agreement with Galen Advisors
LLC, which we entered into in November2003. Under the terms of this agreement, Galen Advisors LLC
assisted us in identifying, negotiating and consummating strategic acquisitions. We agreed to pay
a fee of $1million for these services immediately following the closing, if any, of one or more
merger or acquisition transactions with a purchase price equal to or in excess of $25million in
the aggregate. This consulting agreement terminated upon the payment of this fee. The fee was
recorded as a component of the Empi acquisition costs. During 2002, we paid Galen Associates $200 paid with 63,492 shares of common stock based on a fair
market value of $315 under a Financial Advisory Agreement for various consulting services
provided to the Company in connection with the acquisition of Chattanooga Group, Inc. -76 Table of Contents 18.Legal Proceedings In October2004, we reached a settlement of an outstanding patent litigation matter. The
settlement included us entering into a product license agreement with the plaintiff and paying
certain past royalties involving a portion of our hip implant product line. The initial payment
under the product license agreement was $750, which included amounts related to the past royalties,
as well as settlement cost. We recorded the entire amount in selling, general and administrative
expenses during the third quarter of 2004. We are the subject of a Department of Commerce investigation of Chattanooga Group, Inc.s export
practices with respect to unlawfully trading with an embargoed country, and unlawfully preparing
export documentation. The Department of Commerce investigation commenced prior to our February2002
acquisition of Chattanooga Group, Inc. As of December31, 2004, $140 remained from what was
accrued as a liability for this matter on the Chattanooga Group Inc.s financial statements as of
the date of the acquisition. To the extent we incur monetary fines, costs and legal expenses
related to the Department of Commerce investigation, the sellers from whom we purchased the capital
stock of Chattanooga Group, Inc. have agreed to indemnify us and to pay all reasonable costs,
expenses, settlements and fines in excess of the $140 up to a maximum of $50million. With
respect to the legal expenses, the sellers are only obligated to indemnify and reimburse us for the
legal expenses of the law firm currently handling the investigation or any other law firm of their
choice. If upon final determination or settlement of the Department of Commerce investigation we
ultimately incur total expenses or fines in an amount less than the approximately $140 accrual, we
shall owe the sellers the remainder of the accrual. The Department of Commerce also may revoke our export licenses or
otherwise restrict our ability to export our products. 19.Commitments and Contingencies As of December31, 2004, we had entered into purchase commitments for inventory, capital
acquisitions and other services totaling approximately $419million in the ordinary course of
business. In addition to these items, we have promised to purchase from our third party supplier in
Mexico who supplies the labor component necessary to assemble and finish our soft goods products a
minimum of $506 in labor per year through June30, 2006. We are also obligated to purchase $57
annually from Medireha GmbH, which is 50% owned by us, through June30, 2007 under a distribution
agreement granting us exclusive rights to the distribution of products that Medireha manufactures. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations associated with our purchase obligations
for the next five years

The manufacturing and marketing of orthopedic medical products entails risk of product liability.
From time to time, we have been, and currently we are, subject to product liability claims and
litigation. In the future, we may again be subject to additional product liability claims, which
could have a negative impact on our business. We currently carry product liability insurance
subject to self-insurance deductible amounts. If a product liability claim or series of claims is
brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, our business
could suffer materially and cause our stock price to fall. In addition, as a result of a product
liability claim, we may have to recall some of our products, which could result in significant
costs to us and cause our stock price to fall. 20.Employee Benefit Plans We have a qualified defined contribution plan, which allows for voluntary pre-tax contributions by
employees. We pay all general and administrative expenses of the plan and may make contributions
to the plan. We made matching contributions of approximately $698, $389 and $354 to the plan in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, based on 50% of the first 6% of employee contributions. We also
provide certain medical expense coverage to certain former executives. At December31, 2004, we
had $438 recorded for estimated liabilities related to these post retirement benefits. -77 Table of Contents 21.Guarantor / Nonguarantor Companies of the 93/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 Under the terms of our 93/4% senior subordinated notes due 2012, Encore Medical Corporation and our

-81 Table of Contents Consolidating financial statements prior to 2004 do not provide additional meaningful information
to that presented in the consolidated financial statements, as the issuer Encore Medical
IHC Inc. did not exist prior to 2004 and the nonguarantor companies were not owned by
Encore prior to 2004. As a result, such information has been omitted. 22.Subsequent Event On February3, 2005 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
substantially all of the assets of Osteoimplant Technology, Inc., which included a complete line of
spinal implant products and several knee and hip implant designs. We closed this transaction on
February22, 2005. We borrowed funds from our existing line of credit to finance the $145million
cash purchase price, with potential future milestone payments of $15million based upon the
performance of the acquired company. -82 Table of Contents Item1. Business

PART II. 
Item5. Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As indicated in the certifications in Exhibit31 of this report, our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of our management, have evaluated
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e. Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
required by Securities Exchange Act Rules13a-15b or 15d-15b, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that material
information required to be in this quarterly report is made known to them by others on a timely
basis. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to
the companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statements preparation and presentation. Encore management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal Control 
Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December31, 2004, our
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. See our report on
internal control over financial reporting on page 51. Encores independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page 52. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. On October4, 2004, we acquired Empi, Inc. and subsidiaries Empi, which now comprise a
material part of the Company. The Companys consolidated net sales for the year ended December31,
2004 were approximately $1635million, of which Empi represented approximately $414million. The
Companys consolidated total assets as of December31, 2004 were approximately $5521million, of
which Empi represented approximately $1072million. Empi operates separate locations in the United States and Germany. Empis processes and
systems remained discrete and separate since the date of acquisition, from other systems the
Company has in place. The Company performed due diligence procedures in conjunction with the
acquisition of Empi, and found no material weakness in the design of Empis internal control over
financial reporting. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2004 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B. Other Information None -83 Table of Contents Part III.
