MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Mastech Corporation
have been prepared by management, who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. The statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles and necessarily include amounts based on
management best estimates and judgments.
Management has established and maintains a system of internal controls
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that
the Company financial records reflect authorized transactions of the Company.
The system of internal controls includes widely communicated statements of
policies and business practices that are designed to require all employees to
maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. The internal
controls are augmented by organizational arrangements that provide for
appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibility.
The Company consolidated financial statements have been audited by Arthur
Andersen LLP, independent public accountants, whose report thereon appears on
page 22 of this Form 10-K. As part of its audit of the Company 1997 financial
statements, Arthur Andersen LLP considered the Company system of internal
controls to the extent it deemed necessary to determine the nature, timing and
extent of its audit tests. Management has made available to Arthur Andersen LLP
the Company financial records and related data.
The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for the Company financial
reporting and accounting practices through its Audit Committee, a majority of
the members of which are independent directors. The Audit Committee duties
include recommending to the Board of Directors the independent public
accountants to audit the Company financial statements, reviewing the scope and
results of the independent public accountants activities and reporting the
results of the committee activities to the Board of Directors. The
independent public accountants have met with the Audit Committee with and
without the presence of management representatives, to discuss the results of
their audit work and their comments on the adequacy of internal accounting
controls, and the quality of financial reporting. The independent public
accountants have direct access to the Audit Committee. Sunil Wadhwani

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Mastech Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mastech
Corporation a Pennsylvania corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1996 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1997. These Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Financial
Statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the Financial Statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the Financial Statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Mastech Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                               ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

MASTECH CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Operations  In conjunction with the closing of its initial public offering on December 16,
1996, Mastech Systems Corporation, the entity through which the business of the
Company had been conducted since its inception in July 1986, became an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of Mastech Corporation Mastech or the Company,

productivity of the Company Year 2000 and other services.
Mascot Systems Pvt, Ltd. Mascot, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, was
acquired upon the closing of the Company initial public offering. Mascot is
currently operating one and constructing two other offshore software development
centers in the cities of Bangalore, Pune and Madras, India, respectively.
Mascot current operations serve as Mastech single source for offshore
software development. Also, during 1996, SWAT Systems Corporation, a

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the application of
the following significant accounting policies Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Accounts Receivable
The Company extends credit to clients based upon management assessment of
their creditworthiness. Substantially all of the Company revenues and the
resulting accounts receivable are from large companies, major systems
integrators and governmental agencies. The allowance for uncollectible accounts
was approximately $500,000, $675,000 and $1,040,000 as of December 31, 1995,
1996 and 1997, respectively.
27
MASTECH CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue on time-and-materials contracts as the services
are performed for clients. Revenues on fixed-price contracts are recognized
using the percentage of completion method. Percentage of completion is
determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the
estimated total cost for each contract. If the estimate indicates a loss on a
particular contract, a provision is made for the entire estimated loss without
reference to the percentage of completion. Changes in job performance,
conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and
revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified.
Depreciation and Amortization
The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method in
amounts which allocate the costs of equipment over their estimated useful lives
of five to seven years, and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life
of the improvement or of the underlying lease term.
Intangible assets, which include the excess of cost over net assets acquired,
are amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 5 to 30
years. The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by determining
whether the amortization of the goodwill balance over its remaining life can be
recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. The Company
believes that the carrying amount of these intangible assets will be realizable
over their respective amortization periods.
Currency Translation Adjustment
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the
exchange rate in effect at year-end for balance sheet accounts and the average
exchange rate in effect during the year for revenue and expense accounts.
Translation gains and losses are excluded from the consolidated income
statements and are instead reported as the currency translation adjustment
component of shareholders' equity.
The functional currency of international offices and foreign subsidiaries is
the currency of the country in which the office or subsidiary is located.
Revenues of the Company are billed in the currency of the country in which the
customer is located. Translation gains and losses arising from differences
between the functional and billing currencies are recognized in the consolidated
income statements.
Mastech Systems has loans outstanding from Mascot Systems which have been
eliminated in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
1997. The terms of the loans provide for the scheduled repayment of principal
and accrued interest in fiscal years 2001 through 2005. However, the Company
considers these loans permanently reinvested, and therefore has recorded the
related foreign transaction gains and losses in the currency translation
adjustment as of December 31, 1997.
Income Taxes
The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109. Deferred income taxes are
provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and
the tax basis of the Company assets and liabilities.
Prior to its initial public offering, the Company elected to be taxed under
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended S-Corporation
for income tax purposes. Accordingly, the income of the Company was reported on
the individual income tax returns of its shareholders. Therefore, the financial
statements do not include a provision for income taxes related to income prior
to the closing of the initial public offering.
28
MASTECH CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company S-corporation status terminated in connection with the Company
initial public offering, thereby subjecting the Company income to federal and
state income taxes at the corporate level. Due to temporary differences in
recognition of revenues and expenses at the time of the initial public offering,
income for financial reporting purposes exceeded income for income tax
purposes. Accordingly, the application of the provisions of SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes resulted in the recognition of deferred tax
liabilities and a corresponding one-time charge to expense of $39 million as
of the date the S-corporation was terminated. The majority of this tax provision
will be paid through the year 2000.
In the recent past, the government of India has provided incentives, in the
form of tax holidays, to encourage foreign investment. The Company operations
in India is eligible for a tax holiday for a five year period beginning in 1997.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
The majority of the Company projects with customers, including those related
to year 2000 conversion, generally provide that the Company will supply
consultants to perform agreed-upon procedures under the customer supervision.
The Company responsibility under these agreements with respect to each
application is subject to satisfactory acceptance testing of such procedures
within a limited, specified period of time. At this time, the Company is unable
to quantify the potential risk to the Company related to year 2000 conversions
from future claims in the event that certain year 2000 applications are not
converted or do not perform in accordance with mutually agreed-upon acceptance
criteria in the year 2000, which is beyond the limited, specific period of time
set forth in the agreements. Nonetheless, management does not believe that
claims that may arise as a result of the above will have a significant impact on
either the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
The Company is a party to several preferred vendor contracts and is seeking
additional similar contracts in order to obtain new or additional business from
large or medium-sized clients. While these contracts are expected to generate
higher volumes, they generally result in lower margins. Although the Company
attempts to lower costs to maintain margins, there can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to sustain margins on such contracts. In addition, the
failure to be designated a preferred vendor, or the loss of such status, may
preclude the Company from providing services to existing or potential clients,
except as a subcontractor. Nonetheless, management does not believe that claims
that may arise as a result of the above will have a significant impact on either
the financial position or the results of operations of the Company.
In 1997, the Company initiated a complete risk evaluation and assessment
study to determine the preparedness level of customers, vendors, and other
service providers for the Year 2000 and the subsequent impact on the Company. 
The review will be completed in June 1998 and based upon the results of the 
review, ongoing Year 2000 impact analysis and risk assessment will continue as
management deems appropriate. The Company expects to incur internal staff 
costs as well as consulting and other expenses related to the risk evaluation 
and assessment project. Cost estimates for the project are not yet available.
Financial Instruments
The fair values and carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments,
primarily accounts receivable and payable, are approximately equivalent. The
financial instruments are classified as current and will be liquidated within
the next operating cycle.
Pro Forma Information Unaudited  The pro forma adjustments for income taxes included in the accompanying
consolidated income statements are based upon the statutory rates in effect for
C-corporations during the periods presented.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the Company 1995 and 1996
financial statements to conform to current year presentation.

The Company S-corporation status terminated in connection with the Company
initial public offering, thereby subjecting the Company income to federal and
state income taxes at the corporate level.
Prior to the initial public offering, the Company elected Subchapter 
S-corporation status for income tax purposes. Accordingly, the income of the
Company was reported on the individual income tax returns of its shareholders.
The financial statements, therefore, do not include a provision for income taxes
prior to the closing of the initial public offering.

4.  Revolving Credit Facility  The Company had a revolving credit facility with a bank. Borrowings
under this arrangement were unsecured, were limited to $150 million, bore
interest at LIBOR, 707 % at December 31, 1996, plus 10% or the
prime rate 825% at December 31, 1996 and were payable upon demand. There were
no borrowings outstanding under this arrangement as of December 31, 1996.
Average outstanding borrowings under this arrangement were $14 million and
$535,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
Effective May 30, 1997, the Company replaced the above mentioned revolving
credit facility with a $250 million revolving credit facility with a bank
the Facility. The Facility bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 10%
or prime at the Company option and borrowings are unsecured. The Facility
contains certain restrictive covenants and financial ratio requirements which
would limit distributions to shareholders and additional borrowings. There were
no borrowings outstanding under this arrangement as of December 31, 1997.
Average outstanding borrowings under this arrangement were $489,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1997.

These borrowings will be repaid by the Company upon approval by the government
of India for the repatriation of such funds necessary to repay these
obligations. 5. Related Party Transactions  As an S-corporation, the net income of the Company was attributed, for federal
and some state income tax purposes, directly to the Company shareholders
rather than to the Company. During 1996 and 1997, the Company had from time to
time paid the corresponding income taxes due on these amounts on behalf of the
controlling shareholders in the form of interest-free advances which were later
repaid. The highest aggregate amounts of advances outstanding to one of the
controlling shareholders and his Qualified Subchapter S Trust during 1996 and
1997 were approximately $1,682,000 and $96,000, respectively. The highest
aggregate amounts of advances outstanding to the other controlling shareholder
and his Qualified Subchapter S Trust during 1996 and 1997 were approximately
$1,682,000 and $158,000, respectively
Mascot Systems leases from the controlling shareholders the office space for
the offshore software development facilities in Bangalore, India. The
acquisition of the real estate and the construction of this office building but
not the buildout of the office space was financed entirely by the controlling
shareholders out of personal funds. Specifically, Mascot Systems leases
approximately 4,200 square feet of office space on one floor of an office
building located in Bangalore which is owned by the controlling
shareholders. The lease has a one-year term expiring in March 1998, and the rent
is approximately $7,000 per year. Mascot Systems also leases a 30,000-square-
foot office building located in Bangalore from the controlling shareholders.
This lease has a five-year term expiring in October 2001, and the annual rent is
approximately $110,000 per year. The offshore software development facilities
located in Pune and Madras, India are scheduled to be operational sometime
during the first quarter of 1998. Mascot Systems expects to enter into two
additional leases with the controlling shareholders for these facilities. The
facility in Pune is a 35,000-square-foot office building, and the facility in
Madras is a 65,000-square-foot office building. See also Note 11.
Scott Systems leases, for its training facilities, approximately 2,100 square
feet of office space on one floor of an office building located in Mumbai
Bombay, India. The leased space is divided into five separately owned suites
owned individually by the controlling shareholders. The leases have a one-year
term expiring in April 1998, and the aggregate rent is $20,000 per year. Scott
Systems also leases further office space of approximately 900 square feet on
another floor in the same office building which is owned by the controlling
shareholders. The lease has a one-year term expiring in October 1998, and the
rent is $6,000 per year. Scott Systems also leases a portion of the Pune
facility from the controlling shareholders. This lease covers 7,500 square feet
and has a three year term expiring in September 2000. The rent is $26,000 per
year. See also Note 11.
The Company had loans outstanding from the Company controlling shareholders
of $16,000 and $0 as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively. These loans
are included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has employment agreements with its controlling shareholders and
certain of its executive officers which provide generally for specified minimum
salaries and bonuses based upon the Company performance. 7. Employee Benefit Plans  The Company sponsors a 401k benefit plan. Eligible employees, as defined in
the plan, may contribute up to 15% of eligible compensation, as defined.  The
Company does not contribute to this plan. 8.  Non-recurring Charges  In October 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with an executive
pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay this individual, as compensation for
past services, an amount equal to the value of 109,200 shares of Common Stock at
the initial public offering price of $15 per share. One-half of this payment was
made in cash, at the election of the executive, on December 16, 1996. The
remaining half of this obligation was satisfied on December 16, 1996 via the
issuance of 54,600 shares of restricted Common Stock, as described in Note 9.
The Company has reflected the cash payment along with the applicable tax
withholdings as a non-recurring charge in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income for the year ended December 31, 1996.
For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company has reflected the
amortization of deferred compensation for this same executive as a non-recurring
charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
9.  Stock-Based Compensation and Restricted Stock Award  Effective December 16, 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan
the Plan for directors, executive management and key personnel. The Plan
provides for the issuance of up to 2,160,000 stock-based incentive awards at the
market value of the stock at the date of grant. The Company accounts for the
Plan under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. Had compensation costs for the Plan been determined
consistent with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123, net income for the year ended
December 31, 1996 would have been reduced by $12,000 and there would have been
no impact on pro forma basic and diluted earnings per common share for the same
period. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the impact of SFAS No. 123 would
have reduced net income and basic and diluted earnings per share by
approximately $13 million or $006 per share, respectively.                    33

There were 1,314,450 and 963,900 reserved for future grants under the 1996
Stock Option Plan at December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
Effective December 16, 1996, the Company entered into an employment agreement
with an executive that included the granting of 54,600 shares of restricted
common stock. During the restricted period from December 16, 1996 to June 30,
1998, the restricted stock vests ratably and daily. The agreement provides for
partial awards and forfeitures under various circumstances. At December 31, 1996
and 1997, the Company consolidated balance sheet reflects deferred
compensation of $776,000 and $258,000, respectively, related to this award, as
an offset to shareholders' equity. Compensation expense of $43,000 and $518,000
related to the vesting of restricted shares during 1996 and 1997, respectively,
has been recorded in the Company consolidated income statement. 10. Earnings per Common Share  In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS No. 128,
which establishes new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share.
SFAS No. 128 is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending
after December 15, 1997, including interim periods. The Company adopted SFAS No.
128 during 1997. Earnings per share for the pro forma periods were not impacted
by the adoption of SFAS No. 128.
Basic pro forma net income per common share and earnings per common share is
calculated by dividing pro forma net income and net income, respectively, by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted
pro forma net income per common share and earnings per common share is
calculated by dividing pro forma net income and net income, respectively, by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the
assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.
The 1996 diluted shares outstanding, as calculated below, also includes
393,462 common shares, which represents the number of shares, when multiplied by
the initial public offering price, would have been sufficient to replace the
capital in excess of earnings withdrawn as dividends during the period.
