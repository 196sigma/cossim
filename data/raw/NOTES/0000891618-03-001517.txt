To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IRIDEX Corporation In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity, of cash flows
and of comprehensive income loss present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of IRIDEX Corporation and its Subsidiaries the Company at
December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 and the results of their operations,
their cash flows and comprehensive income loss for each of the three years in
the period ended December 28, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index under 15a2
on page 65 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
Description of Business
IRIDEX Corporation is a leading worldwide provider of
semiconductor-based laser systems used to treat eye diseases in ophthalmology
and skin lesions in aesthetics.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
invests primarily in money market funds and government paper; accordingly, these
investments are subject to minimal risks.
Available-for-Sale Securities
All marketable securities as of December 28, 2002 and December 29, 2001
are considered to be available-for-sale and therefore are carried at fair value.
Available-for-sale securities are classified as current assets when they have
scheduled maturities of less than one year. Available-for-sale securities are
classified as non current assets when they have scheduled maturities of more
than one year. Unrealized holding gains and losses on such securities are
reported net of related taxes as a separate component of stockholders' equity
until realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are
reported in interest and other income and are computed using the specific
identification cost method.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a
first-in, first-out FIFO method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by
considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and other
factors.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three years.
Amortization of leasehold improvements and property and equipment is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related
assets, typically three years.                    -47     Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase
order and product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and
collection of the receivables is deemed probable. Shipments are generally made
with Free-On-Board FOB shipping point terms, whereby title passes upon
shipment from our dock. Any shipments with FOB receiving point terms are
recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point. Up-front
fees received in connection with product sales are deferred and recognized over
the associated product shipments.
Warranty
The Company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of
products in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Actual
warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued. The
Company warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered
defective or fail to meet the product specifications. We analyze historical
returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance
of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance.
Warranty costs are reflected in the income statement as a cost of revenues. A
reconciliation of the changes in the Company warranty liability for the year
ending December 28, 2002 follows in thousands                        
Balance at the beginning of the year       $ 582
Accruals for warranties issued during the year   463
Settlements made in kind during the year      249
Balance at the end of the year          $ 796
Research and Development
Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as
incurred.
Advertising
We expense advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expenses
for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $242,000, $408,000 and $478,000, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Carrying amounts of our financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
approximate fair values due to their short maturities. Estimated fair values for
available-for-sale securities, which are separately disclosed elsewhere, are
based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements in
accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to EmployeesAPB 25 and complies with the
disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationSFAS 123.
Under APB 25, compensation expense for grants to employees is based on
the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the
Company stock and the option exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a fair value
based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity
investment. The pro forma disclosure of the difference between compensation
expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value
method is presented in Note 6.
The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than
Employees, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and Services. Stock-based
compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is
recognized on a straight line basis as the stock options are earned. The
stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate as the deemed fair market value
of the common stock fluctuates. There were no equity instruments issued to
non-employees in 2002, 2001 and 2000.

-49     Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money market
accounts of three financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed
the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may
be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal risk.
We market our products to distributors and end-users throughout the
world. Sales to international distributors are generally made on open credit
terms and letter of credit. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.
Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses related to
individual customers or group of customers in any particular geographic area.
For the years ended December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000
no customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenue. As of December 28, 2002,
one customer accounted for 11% of accounts receivable. As of December 29, 2001
and December 30, 2000 no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts
receivable.
Our products require approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and
international regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. Our future
products may not receive required approvals. If we were denied such approvals,
or if such approvals were delayed, it would have a materially adverse impact on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Reliance on Certain Suppliers
Certain components and services used by the Company to manufacture and
develop its products are presently available from only one or a limited number
of suppliers or vendors. The loss of any of these suppliers or vendors would
potentially require a significant level of hardware and/or software development
to incorporate the products or services into the Company products.
Use of Estimates
Management makes estimates and assumptions to prepare the consolidated
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on prior year
stockholders' equity or results of operations. In addition, as a result of
IRIDEX disposal of it Laser Research segment in 2001, the Company
previously reported consolidated financial statements for 2001 and 2000 have
been reclassified to present the discontinued Laser Research segment operations
separate from continuing operations. See Note 12.
Fiscal Year
Our fiscal year covers a 52 or 53 week period and ends on the Saturday
nearest December 31. Fiscal year 2000, 2001 and 2002 all included 52 weeks.                    -50     Net Income loss per Share
Basic and diluted net income per share are computed by dividing net
income loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted net income
loss per share excludes potential common stock if their effect is
anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consists of incremental common shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145 Rescission of FASB
Statement No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections, which eliminates inconsistencies between the required accounting
for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback
transactions. SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or
describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of SFAS
No. 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002 and for
transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS
No. 145 to have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of
operations.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Exit or
Disposal Activities which addresses the recognition, measurement, and reporting
of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities, including
restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the
guidance that the EITF has set forth in EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No. 146
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have a
material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, or FIN 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that a liability
be recorded in the guarantor balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee. In
addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has
issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entity product warranty
liabilities. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN
45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor fiscal year-end. The
disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of
interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45
did not have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of
operations.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. EITF 00-21 establishes criteria for whether revenue on a
deliverable can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple
deliverable arrangement. The criteria consider whether the delivered item has
standalone value to the customer, whether the fair value of the delivered item
can be reliably determined and the rights of returns for the delivered items.
EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years
beginning June 15, 2003 with early adoption permitted. We do not expect that the
adoption of EITF 00-21 to have a material impact on our financial position or on
our results of operations.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation- Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for
a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based                    -51 employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also requires prominent disclosures of the
pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation in both annual and interim financial statements. The
transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 148 are effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements
are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The
adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material impact on our financial
position or on our results of operations.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. This interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses
consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which
possess certain characteristics. The Interpretation requires that if a business
enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity,
the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest
entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of
the business enterprise. This Interpretation applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to variable interest
entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. We do not
have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of December 28, 2002. We
will apply the consolidation requirements of FIN 46 in future periods if we
should own any interest in any variable interest entity.

5.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Lease Agreements
We lease our operating facilities under a noncancelable operating lease.
The lease, which expired in 2002, was renewed for two years. Rent expense, net
of sublease income, totaled $642,000, $498,000 and $289,000 for the years ended
December 28, 2002, December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 respectively. Rental

The Company is obligated to pay royalties equivalent to 5% and 75% of
sales on certain products under certain license agreements. Royalty expense was
$105,000, $85,000 and $21,000 for the years ended December 28, 2002, December
29, 2001 and December 30, 2000, respectively.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may be engaged in certain administrative
proceedings, incidental to its normal business activities. Management believes
that liabilities resulting from such proceedings, or claims which are pending or
known to be threatened, are adequately covered by liability insurance and will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations.
6.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Our Articles of Incorporation authorize 2,000,000 shares of undesignated
preferred stock. Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series. As of December 28, 2002, we had no preferred stock issued and
outstanding.
TREASURY STOCK
In December 1998, we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to
150,000 shares of our Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market. We
plan to utilize all of the reacquired shares for reissuance in connection with
our employee stock programs. In 2000 and 2002, no shares of Common Stock were
repurchased. In 2001, we repurchased 27,000 shares of Common Stock for $115,000.
As of December 28, 2002 we have repurchased 103,000 shares of common stock.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
Amended and Restated 1989 Incentive Stock Plan
The Amended and Restated 1989 Plan the 1989 Plan provided for the
grant of options and stock purchase rights to purchase shares of our Common
Stock to employees and consultants. The terms of the 1989 Plan, which expired in
August 1999, are substantially the same as the 1998 Plan described below.
1998 Stock Plan
The 1998 Stock Plan the 1998 Plan provides for the granting to
employees including officers and employee directors of incentive stock options
and for the granting to employees including officers and employee directors
and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights
SPRs. The exercise price of incentive stock options and SPRs granted under
the 1998 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares at
the time of grant. With respect to any recipient who owns stock possessing more
than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, the exercise
price of any option or SPR granted must be at least equal to 110% of the fair
market value at the time of grant. Options granted under the 1998 Plan are
exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the
Administrator; generally over a four year period. The maximum term of incentive
stock options granted to any recipient must not exceed ten years; provided,
however, that the maximum term of an incentive stock option granted to any
recipient possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding
capital stock must not exceed                    -54 five years. In the case of SPRs, unless the Administrator determines otherwise,
we have a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary
termination of the purchaser employment with us for any reason including
death or disability. Such repurchase option lapses at a rate determined by the
Administrator. The purchase price for shares repurchased by us is the original
price paid by the purchaser. The form of consideration for exercising an option
or stock purchase right, including the method of payment, is determined by the
Administrator. The 1998 Plan expires in June 2008.
1995 Director Option Plan
In October 1995, we adopted the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director
Plan, under which members of the Board of Directors are granted options to
purchase 11,250 shares upon the first to occur of their appointment or the
adoption of the Director Plan First Option and an option to purchase 3,750
shares Subsequent Option on July 1 of each year thereafter provided that he
or she has served on the Board for at least the preceding six months. The
options granted are at fair market value on the date of grant. The First Option
becomes exercisable as to one-twelfth 1/12 of the shares subject to the First
Option for each quarter over a three-year period. Each Subsequent Option becomes
exercisable as to one-fourth 1/4 of the shares subject to the Subsequent
Option for each quarter, commencing one quarter after the First Option and any
previously granted Subsequent Options have become fully exercisable. Options
granted under the Director Plan have a term of 10 years.
In the event of our merger with or into another corporation, resulting
in a change of control, or the sale of substantially all of our assets, each
Director Plan option becomes exercisable in full and shall be exercisable for 30
days after written notice to the holder of the event causing the change in
control.
Unless terminated sooner, the Director Plan will terminate in 2005. The
Board has authority to amend or terminate the Director Plan, provided no such
amendment may impair the rights of any optionee without the optionee consent.
1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors in October 1995. The total number of shares of common
stock reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan at December 28, 2002 were
370,000. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees including officers and
employee directors to purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions, which
may not exceed 10% of an employee compensation. No employee may purchase more
than $25,000 worth of stock in any calendar year or more than 1,000 shares of
Common Stock in any twelve-month period. The price of shares purchased under the
Purchase Plan is 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock
at the beginning of the offering period or the end of the offering period. The
Purchase Plan will terminate in 2005, unless terminated sooner by the Board of
Directors.                    -55     Information with respect to activity under these option plans are set

At December 29, 2001 and December 30, 2000 options to purchase 972,249

The following information concerning our stock option and employee stock
purchase plans is provided in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. We account for such plans in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board No. 25 and related Interpretations.
The fair value of each option grant has been estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions                         2002           2001           2000

Dividend Yield..   --      --      --      --      --          The weighted average expected life was calculated based on the exercise
behavior of each group. Group A represents officers and directors who are a
smaller group holding a greater average number of options than other option
holders and who tend to exercise later in the vesting period. Group B are all
other option holders, virtually all of whom are employees. This group tends to
exercise earlier in the vesting period.
The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of those options
granted in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $248, $282 and $596, respectively.
We have also estimated the fair value for the purchase rights issued
under our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under the Black-Scholes valuation
model using the following assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999                     2002     2001       2000

7.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
We have a plan known as the IRIS Medical Instruments 401k trust to
provide retirement benefits through the deferred salary deductions for
substantially all employees. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their annual
compensation to the plan, limited to a maximum amount set by the Internal
Revenue Service. The plan also provides for Company contributions at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. On April 1, 2000 the Company commenced a
Company match for the 401k in the amount of 50% of employee contributions up
to an annual maximum of $1,000 per year. The Company contributions totaled
$98,000 in 2002 and $99,000 in 2001. No contributions were made in fiscal 2000.

purchase shares, respectively, at a weighted average exercise price of $597 and
$982 per share, respectively, that were not included in the computation of
diluted net income loss per common share since, in each case, the exercise
price of the options exceeded the market price of the common stock. In 2001,
there were 1,656,817 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of
$534 per share that were not included in the computation of dilutive net loss
per common share because their effect was anti-dilutive. These options could
dilute earnings per share in future periods.

In April 2001, we discontinued our Laser Research segment. In the first
quarter of 2001, we recorded a loss of $893,000 net of a $542,000 tax benefit.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, we adjusted the loss on discontinued operations
to $672,000 net of a $439,000 income tax benefit. There were no revenues,
costs or operating expenses for the Laser Research segment in 2002 or 2001.
Sales, general and administrative costs and indirect costs of manufacturing
historically were not allocated to the Laser Research segment.
The Laser Research segment conducted research and development under
research grants from the U.S. Federal Government and others. We discontinued our
Laser Research activities to better focus available resources on our medical
applications and products. The assets of the segment, primarily inventory, were
fully reserved and the liabilities were fully paid. The components of the
recorded loss were inventory costs of $07 million, the loss on operations for
the first quarter of 2001 of $03 million, estimated sales return costs of $02
million, estimated costs for the phase-out period of $01 million and purchase
order commitments of $01 million offset by a tax benefit of $05 million. In
the fourth quarter of 2001, the accrued loss for the discontinuation of the
segment was adjusted to reflect fewer than anticipated product returns.                    -62
