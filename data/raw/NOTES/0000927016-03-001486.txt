40 BIOSPHERE MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A Nature of the Business BioSphere Medical, Inc. the Company was
incorporated in Delaware in December 1993. During 1999, the Company strategically refocused its business on the development and commercialization of its proprietary Embosphere Microspheres and other ancillary embolotherapy products for use in treating uterine fibroids, hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous
malformations. Between February 1999 and October 2001, the Company acquired all ownership interests in Biosphere Medical S.A. BMSA, a French societe anonyme. BMSA holds the license to the embolotherapy platform device that is the main
focus of the Companys business. In May 1999, the Company sold substantially all of the assets relating to its former core business, chromatography, and changed its name from BioSepra, Inc. to BioSphere Medical, Inc. During 2000, the Company established two wholly owned
subsidiaries to pursue the development of other microsphere applications and technologies. In April 2000, Biosphere Medical Japan, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was established to develop and commercialize Embosphere Microspheres and EmboGold Microspheres collectively our Microspheres, as well as HepaSphere SAP Microspheres in Asia. In December 2000, BSMD Ventures, Inc., also a Delaware corporation, was established to explore and develop
alternative applications for the Companys microsphere platform technology. The Company believes that existing working capital, together with anticipated sales proceeds from its Microspheres and other medical device products, will provide liquidity sufficient to allow the
Company to meet its expected spending obligations for at least the next twelve-month period, while also allowing the further development and testing of other product candidates and technologies. However, no assurances can be given that such revenues
will, in fact, be realized, or that the Company will have sufficient capital to meet its obligations beyond the next twelve-month period. Should the Company not realize some or all of its revenue projections, or otherwise fail to have sufficient
capital for its planned operations, it may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements or pursue additional strategic partners, neither of which may be available to the Company on favorable terms or at all, and/or defer or limit some or
all of its sales, marketing, research, development and/or clinical projects. B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries BMSA, Biosphere Medical Japan, Inc. and BSMD Ventures, Inc. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Translation of Foreign Currencies The assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect as of each balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated at average exchange
rates prevailing during each reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in stockholders equity. Aggregate foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are not material and
are included in other income in the accompanying statement of operations for all periods presented. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the following: 1 the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 2 the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and 3 the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
41 BIOSPHERE MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less, as of the date of purchase, to be cash equivalents. In accordance with the Companys investment policy, surplus cash is invested in investment grade corporate and US government debt as
well as certain asset-backed securities. The Company determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at each balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2001, all marketable securities were classified as held to maturity, as the
Company had both the intent and ability to hold all such assets to maturity. Upon maturity, in April 2002, of all assets classified as held to maturity as of December 31, 2001, the Company classified all subsequent investment purchases as current
and available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys $10626 million in marketable securities have a weighted average maturity equal to 12 months and are classified as current and available-for-sale, since the Company has the intent
to use such securities to satisfy current liabilities as needed. Available-for-sale marketable securities are carried at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying
balance sheet. Concentration of Credit
Risk and Off-Balance Sheet Risk The
Company has no material concentrations of credit risk, nor is it a party to any financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt obligations. The estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The Company places its cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities with high credit quality financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to a large number of customers and their dispersion across many
geographic areas. The Company subcontracts a key
portion of its final packaging processes to an independent third-party contract manufacturer. If such services were disrupted or not available at a reasonable cost from the existing contract manufacturer, the Company would need to obtain new
contracts with new providers or incur the expense of internalizing the packaging process. Such a conversion could cause the Company to incur additional expense in validating the process under FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, delay the availability
of finished product and limit commercial sales of our products. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation based upon expected useful lives using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:  Office equipment
3-5 years
Laboratory and manufacturing equipment
3-5 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of lease term or estimated usefullife
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of disposed assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or
charged to non-operating income. 
42 BIOSPHERE MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Goodwill and Other Assets Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price
and the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired when accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting. Between February 1999 and November 2001, the Company recorded goodwill upon the periodic
step-acquisitions of BMSA. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill associated with all step-acquisitions of BMSA was being amortized over the shorter of an estimated ten-year useful life or February 2009, which represents a ten-year amortization period
from the date of the original BMSA purchase agreement See Note C. Accumulated amortized goodwill was $351,000 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company prospectively adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and as a result, the Company ceased the amortization of the $144 million in goodwill recorded as of December 31, 2001. In lieu of periodic amortization, the Company is required to perform
annual impairment reviews of its goodwill. Goodwill was derived from the step acquisition of BMSA, the consolidated subsidiary that holds the license to the embolotherapy platform device that is the main focus of the Companys business.
Accordingly, impairment measurements are based upon the discounted cash flows of BMSA statutory profitability and anticipated worldwide sales of the Companys Microspheres. Based upon the Companys review, the Company has not recorded any
impairment charges. During the year ended
December 31, 2001, the Company recorded approximately $177,000 or $002 per share of amortization expense within its general and administrative expenses and would have recorded an estimated $201,000 of amortization expense during year ended
December 31, 2002 or $002 per share. Had goodwill amortization been accounted for in accordance with SFAS 142 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Companys reported net loss and basic and diluted net loss per common
share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below:  For the years ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 In thousands, except per share amounts Net loss As reported

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets As of December 31, 2002, the Company has evaluated the potential impairment of its long-lived assets with respect to events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of a recorded asset may not be
recoverable. Based on managements assessment as of December 31, 2002, the Company has determined that no impairment of long-lived assets exists. Revenue Recognition Revenues from product sales are recognized when requested goods are shipped to customers and collectibility is deemed probable. Management
establishes reserves for potential sales returns and evaluates, on a monthly basis, the adequacy of those reserves based upon realized experience. To date, returns have been minimal and immaterial. 
43 BIOSPHERE MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Research and Development Research and development costs, including product validation
costs under FDA Good Manufacturing Practices, are expensed in the period incurred. Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability accounting method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using current statutory tax rates. A valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Management evaluates, on a quarterly basis, the ability to recover the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance. At such time as it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable, the valuation
allowance will be appropriately reduced. Comprehensive Income/Loss Comprehensive income/loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income/loss. Other comprehensive income/loss includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net loss. Specifically, the effects of foreign
currency translation adjustments which are reflected separately in stockholders equity are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss. Net Loss Per Share Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net
loss per share incorporates the dilutive effect of common stock equivalent options, warrants and other convertible securities. Common stock equivalents, as determined in accordance with the treasury-stock accounting method, equaled 1,864,000,
2,879,000 and 3,095,000 as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average price of the Companys common stock used in determining common stock equivalents equaled $512, $942 and $1202 as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Total common stock options and warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 equaled 3,931,000, 4,086,000 and 4,147,000, respectively. Common stock equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of weighted average
number of diluted common shares, as their effect would be antidilutive for all periods presented. Stock Options The Company applies the principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its stock incentive plans. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is measured as the difference, if any, between the option exercise price and the fair value of the Companys
common stock at the date of grant. The Company has historically granted options to employees and directors at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Companys common stock. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for
its employee stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes a fair value based approach for valuing stock options. The Company follows the disclosure-only alternative afforded by SFAS No. 123. Had
compensation costs for stock options issued to employees and directors been determined based on the estimated fair value at the grant dates as calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Companys reported net loss and

The
average estimated fair value of options granted during fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, was $366, $1005, and $1239, respectively, and was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions 2002

The
Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option-pricing models require the use of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimates, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock-based compensation. Employee Stock Purchase Plans In June 2000, stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the 2000 ESPP. Under the 2000 ESPP, an aggregate of 50,000 shares of common stock may be purchased by employees at 85% of the fair market value on the first or last day of each six-month offering period, whichever is
lower. During each offering period, the maximum number of shares which may be purchased by a participating employee is determined on the first day of the offering period and is equal to the number of shares of common stock determined by dividing
$12,500 by the last reported sale price of the common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the first day of the offering. An eligible employee may elect to have up to a maximum of 10% deducted through payroll deductions from his or her regular
salary. During 2000, no shares were issued under the 2000 ESPP. During 2001 and 2002, 13,508 and 3,683 shares of the Companys common stock were issued under the 2000 ESPP, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation to Non-Employees
The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation to non-employees using the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123. In connection with stock options previously issued to non-employees, during 2000, 
45 BIOSPHERE MEDICAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
B Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Continued 
the Companys Board of Directors authorized the Company to accelerate the vesting of all non-employee advisors stock options
previously subject to variable accounting principles. Accordingly, $1,261,000 in non-cash compensation expense was recorded and presented as a separate line item within the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000. The recorded
$1,261,000 aggregate fair value of the non-employee stock options was derived from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. As a result of stock options issued to non-employee medical board advisors, the Company recognized $38,000 in non-employee compensation
expense during the year ended December 31, 2002. The fair value of the non-employee stock options was derived from the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities FAS 146. FAS 146 reconsiders all of the guidance contained in EITF 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs
Incurred in a Restructuring. FAS 146 applies to costs associated with a certain termination benefits commonly identified as one-time termination benefits, b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease, and c other
associated costs, including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees. FAS 146, which may be adopted early, is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating FAS 146 and
is unable, at this time, to determine the impact, if any, that might exist as a result of adopting this standard. FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor Accounting, will significantly change current practice in the accounting for, and
disclosure of, guarantees. Most guarantees are to be recognized and initially measured at fair value, which is a change from current practice. In addition, guarantors will be required to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of
the guarantor making payments under the guarantee is remote. In general, the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an
underlying that is related to an asset, liability, or an equity security of the guaranteed party. The Interpretations disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December15,
2002, while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Based on experience to date, the Company does not believe the adoption of this
statement will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. At the November 21, 2002 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which addresses
how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and/or rights to use assets. The final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June15, 2003 with early adoption permitted. Additionally, companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with APB Opinion No.
20, Accounting Changes. The Company does not believe the adoption of EITF 00-21 will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. Reclassifications In accordance with SEC guidelines, certain prior year costs and expenses and other non-operating
income/expense balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

C Step
Acquisition of Biosphere Medical S.A. and Minority Interest Acquisition Obligation On February 25, 1999, the Company acquired 51% of the outstanding capital stock of BMSA. Pursuant to a February 25, 1999 purchase agreement, the Company acquired this ownership interest by granting to
BMSA an exclusive sales and manufacturing license to certain patents and technology primarily relating to the Companys Embosphere Microspheres technology. The Company was also granted an option to purchase the remaining 49% interest in BMSA
through December 31, 2004, for an amount equal to the product of the percentage interest to be purchased and the sum of BMSAs rolling average twelve-month sales and worldwide Embosphere Microspheres sales as of the date of exercise the
Purchase Option. Moreover, the holder of the remaining 49% interest was also granted an option the Put Option to require the Company to purchase the remaining 49% interest from December 31, 2003 until December 31, 2004 for
an amount equal to the greater of an agreed upon price in French Francs for each percentage interest to be sold or the amount payable adjusted to a rolling nine-month sales average under the Purchase Option. The Put Option represented a contingent
purchase consideration for which the Company accreted the value of the Put Option through October 31, 2001. On April 7, 2000, the Company purchased an additional 34% of BMSA for $950,000. As a result of this step-acquisition, the Companys
total ownership interest in BMSA increased to 85%. On November 5, 2001, the Company acquired the remaining 15% interest in BMSA for approximately $953,000. Both step-acquisition transactions were accounted for under purchase accounting principles
whereby the fair value in excess of the net assets purchased was treated as an increase to goodwill. Net goodwill, comprised entirely of the unamortized purchase price paid in excess of the net BMSA assets acquired, equaled $14 million as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001. D Related Party
Transactions As of December 31, 2001,
receivable from related party included offering expenses in the amount of $343,000 that Sepracor, Inc. agreed to pay as a result of Sepracors participation in the July 2001 secondary offering of 40 million shares of the Companys common
stock. Partially offsetting the offering expense owed to the Company were amounts due to Sepracor for certain health benefits paid by Sepracor on the Companys behalf, along with related health benefit administrative services provided on an
arms-length basis through October 2001. As of December 31, 2001, all service agreements with Sepracor had been either terminated or discontinued, and as of December 31, 2002, all related party commitments have been settled in full.
As of December 31, 2002, Sepracor owned
approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company. Pursuant to this ownership interest, Sepracor is also entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of a total of 1,400,000 shares of
the Companys Common Stock. These rights provide that Sepracor may require the Company to register shares, subject to certain conditions and limitations. As of December 31, 2002, Sepracor has not exercised such rights.

Events On January 27, 2003, The
Companys French subsidiary, BioSphere Medical, S.A., received notice from Terumo Europe, N.V. that Terumo has initiated legal proceedings in the Commercial Court of Pontoise, France alleging that it suffered damages from a purported
termination of the distribution contract by BioSphere Medical, S.A. BioSphere Medical, S.A. and Terumo Europe entered into a distribution agreement in January 2002 pursuant to which Terumo Europe became the exclusive distributor of BioSphere
Medical, S.A. EmboSphere Microsphere and EmboGold Microsphere products in certain countries of Europe. It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment as to the final outcome of
this proceeding. The Company strongly believes that Terumos allegations are without merit and we will vigorously defend the claims it has made against the Company.
