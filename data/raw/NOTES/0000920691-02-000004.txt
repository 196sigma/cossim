Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2001 
In thousands, except per share data
1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business and Company Organization. We deliver chemistry products and services, software products and services along with analysis services that advance customers' creativity and productivity in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, biotechnology and related research industries worldwide. We are also a value-added reseller of third-party hardware products required to operate our software products. A substantial portion of our business is conducted with pharmaceutical companies, however, we are not economically dependent on any single customer on an ongoing basis. During 2001, 14% of our global revenue was from Pfizer, Inc. and 10% from Bayer AG.
Basis of Consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tripos and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates, owned more than 20%, but not in excess of 50%, are recorded on the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates less than 20% owned are accounted for under the cost method, except for those investments classified as marketable securities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date purchased. 
Marketable Securities consist of investments in equity securities of unconsolidated affiliates and are held as available-for-sale. We account for securities that can be sold within the next 12 months as marketable securities. Amounts presented are the fair values of the investments on the balance sheet date determined using then current market quotes. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as increases or decreases in the assets' value pre-tax basis with corresponding entries reflected in Other Comprehensive Income and Deferred Taxes until the assets are sold.
Accounts Receivable include current outstanding invoices billed to customers along with amounts due under notes receivable that have contractual payment terms coming due within the next twelve months.
Inventory consists of finished chemical compounds, supplies and work in process at our U.K. subsidiary, Tripos Receptor Research Ltd., and is carried at the lower of cost standard cost method approximating FIFO or market. Amounts shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of an obsolescence reserve. In calculating the reserve, the age and sales trends of each inventory category are taken into account to determine the net realizable value. Any shortfall between the carrying cost of the inventory and the net realizable value is provided for in the reserve.
Notes Receivable-Trade represents customer accounts receivable for the portion of contracted payment terms that come due beyond one year from the balance sheet date. The balance reflected is net of imputed interest discount. 2001
2000 Notes receivable 5,352 2,663 Imputed interest discount
849
600 Notes receivable, net 4,503 2,063 The weighted-average interest rate was 750% in 2001 and 825% in 2000.
Property and Equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by applying an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to ten years for equipment and furniture, twenty-five to thirty-nine years for buildings, the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the life of the related lease for leasehold improvements, and three years for purchased software. We make every attempt to closely match the book useful life of our assets to their expected productive lives. Assets deemed to be impaired or no longer productive, are written down to their net realizable value.
Development Costs consist of software development costs that are capitalized after the establishment of technological feasibility in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86. Amortization of capitalized software development costs is provided on a product-by-product basis as the greater of a the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues or b the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Currently, we use an estimated economic life of three to five years for all capitalized software development costs. 
We assess the recoverability of capitalized software development costs by comparing the remaining unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the related product. Any excess is written off. All other research and development expenditures are charged to research and development expense in the period incurred.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the net assets acquired of Tripos Receptor Research Ltd. over its fair value. Goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. Beginning in 2002, we have adopted Statement of Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142, that suspends amortization of goodwill in favor of periodic evaluations of impairment by comparing the fair value of the business to which the goodwill relates to its carrying value. Any impairment identified under FAS 142 is written off in the period identified. We do not expect adoption of FAS 142 to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operation.
Revenue Recognition. In late 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued statement of Position 97-2 SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and updated it in early 1998 with SOP 98-4. These SOPs became effective for us for transactions entered into after January 1, 1998. We recognize revenue from software licenses in accordance with these SOPs upon product delivery, customer acceptance with all obligations fulfilled at the date of delivery, and determination that collectibility of the sale proceeds is probable. We recognize revenue from software support contracts ratably over the term of the contract, typically one to three years. In software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products; software licenses, specified upgrades, software support services and/or other services; we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relati
ve fair value as determined from vendor-specific objective evidence of each of the deliverables. Revenue from chemical compound sales is recognized upon delivery of the product. Hardware sales are recognized upon delivery of the product from our vendor to the customer.
We have entered into discovery research agreements and software consulting arrangements with certain customers that provide for collaboration in defining related software products, early access to the products, discounts on licenses for the products developed and compound library designs. We recognize revenue related to discovery research and software consulting agreements as contractual milestones are achieved and delivered or, absent such contractual milestones, on a completed contract basis or a percentage of completion basis. The costs of providing the services for these revenues are included in Cost of Sales for the periods in which the services are performed. We reflect costs to fulfill collaborative software development agreements in RD to better reflect the uncertain outcome from this type of research. Revenues and costs of collaborative software development for the last three fiscal years are shown below: Contract RD Revenues and Costs
2001
2000
1999 Collaborative software development services 2,031 1,885 1,285 Research development costs 966 788 525 Warranty. We are a reseller of hardware and pass through to our customers the standard warranties provided by the hardware supplier. We warrant our application software products to perform in accordance with written user documentation and the agreements negotiated with our customers. Since we do not customize our applications software, software warranty costs are insignificant and expensed as incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation. The local foreign currency is the functional currency for each of our foreign operations. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the applicable balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from translation are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Net gains and losses from foreign currency transactions were not significant during any of the years presented and are presented in other income expense. 
Derivative Instruments. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133, which requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. We enter into derivative contracts to limit the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the value of certain sales transactions. Additionally, we have entered interest rate swap contracts to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate. We do not attempt to speculate on the direction of currency rates nor interest rates. We take this conservative approach to protect against the risk of loss only.
Comprehensive Income. Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenue, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements. SFAS 130 requires that all components of comprehensive income, including net income, be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net income and other comprehensive income, including foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on investments, shall be reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. Unrealized loss on our interest rate swap at December 31, 2001 was not significant. 
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related tax, at December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000 are as follows 2001
2000 Foreign currency translation adjustments 279 156 Unrealized gains on marketable securities
6,874
7,534 Accumulated other comprehensive income 6,595 7,378 Income Taxes are computed using the liability method. The primary difference between financial statement income and taxable income results from the use of different methods of computing depreciation, capitalized development costs, other timing differences and the valuation of net operating loss carryforwards.
Earnings Per Common and Dilutive Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potential dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares may consist of outstanding stock options and the assumed conversion of the Series B Preferred shares. See Note 5 for additional information regarding earnings per share.
Stock-Based Compensation. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123, Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation, effective for years beginning after December 1995. However, we have elected to continue following Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock-based transactions. Under APB 25, generally no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of the options equal the fair value of the stock at the grant date. We have adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS 123 as shown in Note 15 to these financial statements.
Accounting Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141, Business Combinations FAS 141 and FAS 142. FAS 141 became effective on July 1, 2001 and requires that all future business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method. FAS 142 became effective on January 1, 2002 and effects the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets. These intangibles, with indefinite lives, are no longer amortized, but rather are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. If impairment is detected, the intangible asset is written down to its fair value. We do not believe the adoption of FAS 142 will have a material effect on earnings or financial position.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supercedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations for a disposal of a segment of a business. FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with earlier application encouraged. We expect to adopt FAS 144 as of January 1, 2002 and do not expect that the adoption of the Statement will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.

Three of Tripos' foreign subsidiaries had loss carryforwards at December 31, 2001, totaling approximately $5,045 that have no expiration date. Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside the United States are considered to be permanently invested. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. income taxes was made for undistributed earnings of such subsidiaries, which aggregated $521 at December 31, 2001.

6. Benefit Plan
In 1994, we established a defined contribution 401k Plan covering all U.S. employees who are at least 21 years of age. Employees may contribute to the plan up to 17% of their compensation, which is further limited by law. We match employee contributions for an amount up to 50% of the first 6% of each employee compensation deferral. Contributions made by the Company were $298 in 2001, $238 in 2000, and $202 in 1999.
7. Geographic Segment Data
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 131, Segment Information SFAS 131 to amend the requirements for public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information about operating segments in interim reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments, as defined in SFAS 131, are components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by our management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We believe we operate in one reportable business-operating segment and therefore present only the following geographic data as representative segment information in conjunction with SFAS 131.
Our foreign operations historically have been conducted principally through our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and third-party distributors. Information regarding operations by geographic area for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is as follows 2001

27 14,981 Most of our services are provided on an integrated worldwide basis. Because of the integration of U.S. and non-U.S. services, it is not practical to separate precisely the U.S.-oriented services from services resulting from operations outside the United States and performed for customers outside the United States; accordingly, the separation set forth in the preceding table is based upon internal allocations, which involve certain management judgments. Net sales and long-lived assets in the preceding table are attributable to the country or territory in which our subsidiaries or distributors are located.
8. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk have consisted principally of investments and trade receivables. We invest available cash in bank deposits, investment-grade securities, and short-term interest-producing investments, including government obligations and other money market instruments. We have adopted credit policies and standards to evaluate the risk associated with our sales and require collateral, such as letters of credit or bank guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. Our management believes that any risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the nature of the customers and distributors with which we do business.
9. Lease Obligations
We lease certain office facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases with terms from one to five years. The capital leases specifically pertain to the acquisition of certain laboratory and computer equipment totaling $1,767. The total accumulated amortization associated with equipment under capital leases was approximately $648 and $450 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The related amortization expense is included in depreciation expense. Rent expense under the operating leases was $768, $666, and $468 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Noncancelable future minimum lease commitments as of December 31, 2001 are: Year Operating Leases

10. Inventory
We maintain a physical inventory of chemical compound libraries in various states of completion. Costs associated with the manufacture of compounds are calculated using the standard cost method and are carried at the lower of cost or market. Compounds that are acquired from third parties are also carried at the lower of cost or market. In calculating the reserve for obsolescence, collections of compounds are reviewed for their age and cumulative sales trends. A reserve provision, whose rate escalates with the passage of time, is made for each collection or library of compounds. If there is a significant adverse deviation in sales trends for a specific compound collection or library, an additional reserve provision is made. Inventory balances at December 31 are 2001

12. Long-term Debt
We have a credit commitment from LaSalle Bank for a $2,905 real estate mortgage for property with a carrying value of $4,476 and a $4,000 revolving line of credit. The credit commitment is collateralized by substantially all of our U.S. assets and stock pledges for each of the U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries. The commitment also requires us to meet certain financial covenants, including certain coverage ratios and a capitalization ratio. During 2001 the credit agreement was amended to its current terms which included a one-year extension of the mortgage note and revolving credit facility. In 2000, we were in violation of the terms of the prior covenant structure that resulted in the mortgage note being classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2000. LaSalle Bank waived each of those prior violations. During 2001, we were in full compliance with all terms of our loan agreements.
The mortgage note under the credit commitment calls for even quarterly principal payments based on a twenty-year amortization schedule that began June 30, 1999. Borrowings under the mortgage are subject to a variable interest rate at LIBOR plus 225%. An interest rate swap agreement was simultaneously entered into that fixed the interest rate at 781%. Upon completing the one-year extension of the credit agreement, a second interest rate swap was arranged that fixed the rate at 740% for the period of April 2002 to March 2003. The $4,000 revolving line of credit under the credit commitment requires quarterly interest-only payments with any remaining borrowings due at the end of the commitment period. Availability under the revolving line of credit is based on eligible U.S. accounts receivable. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates tied to LIBOR or the bank prime rate. No borrowings were made during 2001 nor are any 
outstanding at December 31, 2001.

13. Financial Instruments
We entered into an interest rate swap agreement with LaSalle Bank, N.A. on April 30, 1999 that exchanged our floating interest rate risk for a fixed rate on the mortgage loan related to our corporate headquarters building. The swap contract was constructed to match the original amount borrowed $3,320, quarterly payment amounts $41, and the term of the loan precisely April 30, 1999 to April 2, 2002. During 2001, we executed a second swap agreement that fixed the interest rate for an additional one-year period to match the extension of the mortgage maturity to 2003. At December 31, 2001, $2,905 remained outstanding and the swap agreements remained in place. 
Interest rate swap agreements modify the interest characteristics of a portion of the Company debt. The differential to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The related accrued receivable or payable is included in our accrued liabilities. 
The counterparty to this agreement is LaSalle N.A., a major financial institution with which we have other financial relationships. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by LaSalle. If the counterparty fails to meet the terms of the swap agreement, our exposure is limited to the net amount that would have been received, if any, over the agreement remaining life. We do not anticipate non-performance by LaSalle, given their high credit ratings.
Periodically, we enter into foreign currency hedge transactions to protect us from unfavorable changes in the exchange rate of currencies in certain customer contracts. For transactions qualifying as effective hedges, as determined using either dollar offset method or regression methods, we record these foreign exchange contracts at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. These gains or losses are recognized in income in the period in which the transactions being hedged are recognized. To the extent any contract is not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged transaction, the ineffective portion of the contract is immediately recognized in income.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried in the statement of financial position at its fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.
For transactions that do not qualify as effective hedges, there will be a gain or loss reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the change in currency rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts are included in other income expense net. The counterparty to these foreign currency hedge contracts is LaSalle N.A. At December 31, 2001 a foreign currency future contract was in place, which did not qualify as an effective hedge, to fix the value of E 16 million Euros to U.S. dollars. The fair value of this contract, at December 31, 2001, was $28, which is included in accrued expenses.
14. Acquisition of Tripos Receptor Research Ltd.
On November 11, 1997, we purchased all the outstanding common stock of Receptor Research Ltd, for a mixture of cash, warrants and common stock of Tripos, Inc. The name of the company was changed to Tripos Receptor Research Ltd. on January 7, 1998. Warrants for 40 shares of our common stock vested at December 31, 1998 while warrants for 60 shares vested on December 31, 1999. The warrants were recorded at their fair market value at the date of the grant. The purchase price was allocated to net identifiable assets with the excess recorded as goodwill. The goodwill was being amortized over 15 years on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2001. Effective in 2002, goodwill will no longer be amortized, but the investment will be subject to periodic review to determine if impairment exists. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value at that time. The balance on December 31, 2001 was $958.
15. Stock-based Compensation Plans
In 1994, we adopted the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, that allows eligible employees to purchase stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the enrollment date or exercise date as defined by the plan. Pursuant to the plan, employee purchases are limited to 10% of annual compensation. The plan, which was amended in 1998 to raise the number of shares reserved for issuance from 300 to 700 shares, is in effect for ten years unless terminated or amended sooner by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2001, 660 shares have been purchased under this plan.
In 1994, we adopted the 1994 Stock Plan that is administered by the Compensation Committee and provides for incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights to be granted to our employees and consultants. Pursuant to the plan, incentive stock options can be exercised at a price which is not less than the fair value of the stock on the grant date, and nonstatutory stock options and stock purchase rights can be exercised at a price which is determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the period over which options and rights can be exercised. Options vest at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of each grant and 1/48th per month over the next three years. All options granted have 10-year terms. The plan, which was amended in 2001 to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance from 2,560 to 2,960, is in effect for ten years from the date of inception unless terminated or amended so
oner by the Board of Directors. 
In 1994, we adopted the 1994 Director Option Plan that provides for nonstatutory stock options to be granted to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options can be exercised in 25% increments on the anniversary of its date of grant. The plan, which was amended in 1998 to decrease the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance from 600 to 480, is in effect for ten years from the date of inception unless terminated or amended sooner by the Board of Directors. This plan was amended in 2001 to allow for discretionary grants of options.
We have elected to follow APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for our employee and director stock options because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of our employee and director stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro-forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if we had accounted for employee and director stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates ranging from 496% to 603% for 1999, 583% to 680% for 2000 and 247% to 529% for 2001; volatility factor of 090 for 1999, 092 for 2000 and 092 for 2001; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 53 years for 1999, 45 years for 2000 and 56 years for 2001. For the Tripos Employee Stock Purchase Plan, compensation expense was also estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rates ranging from 496% to 603% for 1999, 583% to 680% for 2000 and 247% to 529% for 2001; volatility factors of 090 for 1999
, 092 for 2000 and 092 for 2001; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 6 months. For all years presented, we used a dividend rate of zero.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee and director stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee and director stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. Tripos' pro forma information follows in thousands, except for earnings per share information Pro Forma

Each right represents the right to purchase one-half preferred share of stock. These rights can be exercised only if certain events occur, which include, among other things, when a beneficial owner our common stock acquires a total of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock.
16. Series B Preferred Stock
On February 4, 2000, we issued 409 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $9,000. Cumulative dividends of $110 per share per annum were payable upon the earlier of the conversion or redemption of such share. Each share of preferred stock was convertible, at the option of the holder, into two shares of our common stock. The preferred stock was to be mandatorily redeemable at a price of $11 per share plus accreted dividends on February 4, 2005 provided that the holder had given notice of its intention to have its shares redeemed on or prior to February 4, 2004. The change in Series B Preferred Stock for the two years ended December 31, 2001 is as follows Issuance of Series B Preferred Stock 8,970 Dividend accretion 856 9,826 On January 29, 2002, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock, LION Bioscience, voluntarily converted the shares into common stock and was paid the accrued dividend in cash. On February 7, 2002, LION sold all of its shares into the market through a broker in a series of block trades.
17. Investment in Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
During the years 1997 to 1999, we invested in the start up of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Arena, a San Diego, California biotechnology company. Our investment in Arena was $3,200 at December 31, 1999. In July of 2000, Arena successfully completed its initial public offering IPO of common stock on the NASDAQ market. At the time of the IPO, our investments in the form of preferred shares and convertible notes were fully converted to common stock, resulting in our holding of slightly more than 2,000 shares of common stock in Arena. During June 2001, Arena completed a secondary offering of additional shares of common stock. We participated in the offering by selling 100 shares and realizing a gain of $2,387.
We are subject to certain restrictions under federal securities laws that limit the number of shares in Arena that can be sold. At December 31, 2001, we classified those shares that are eligible to be sold within one year as marketable securities and reflected them at a fair value totaling approximately $12,838. The remainder of the shares, which are classified as investment in restricted stock, are valued at cost totaling approximately $1,441 at December 31, 2001. Our investment in Arena is subject to a number of uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance to its investors about the market for Arena common stock, the potential volatility in the market price of Arena common stock, or our ability to sell any Arena common stock should we seek to make such sales in the future. In 2002, we have entered into a plan to reduce over time our holdings in Arena. 
18. Relationship with Accenture LLP.
On February 8, 2002, we entered into a marketing alliance agreement with Accenture LLP intended to market and sell a fully integrated solution to automate drug discovery operations of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. Our discovery and enterprise informatics software and our domain expertise in implementing software-based solutions for chemistry research activities is expected to form a substantial part of the integrated systems designed for implementation with Accenture. As part of this arrangement, we issued 33 shares of common stock, valued at $10 million, to Accenture upon entry into this arrangement and agreed to issue another $15 million of stock, based upon prevailing market prices, when a full marketing program is launched. These costs will be amortized over the life of the agreement which is estimated to be five years.
