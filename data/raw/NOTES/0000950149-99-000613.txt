REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
RiboGene, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of RiboGene, Inc. as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related statements of operations, cash flows
and stockholders' equity deficit for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of RiboGene, Inc. at December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1998
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation
RiboGene, Inc. the Company was incorporated in the State of California
on May 5, 1989. The Company was originally founded to develop laboratory
equipment for cell-free protein synthesis. In January 1993, the Company
discontinued development of the lab equipment and began to focus its research
and development efforts on the identification of novel leads and the development
of potential drug candidates for the treatment of infectious diseases. The
Company research effort initially focused on infections caused by fungi and
viruses. In 1996, the Company expanded its research efforts to include
infections caused by bacteria. During 1998, the Company was reincorporated in
the State of Delaware and completed an initial public offering see Note 6.
Also during 1998, the Company significantly expanded its chemistry operations
and established new collaborations. Accordingly, the Company is no longer
classified as a development stage company.
The Company has sustained operating losses since inception and expects such
losses to continue as it furthers its research and development programs. From
inception to December 31, 1998, the Company incurred cumulative net losses of
approximately $42,258,000. The Company will need to obtain additional funds from
outside sources to continue its research and development activities, fund
operating expenses and pursue regulatory approvals for its products under
development. Management believes that sufficient funds are available to support
planned operations through at least mid-2001. The Company may seek to fund its
operations thereafter through collaborative arrangements and through public or
private financings, including debt or equity financings.
All common stock and common per share amounts have been retroactively
restated to reflect a one-for - 14 reverse stock split which was effected in May
1998 see Note 6. All references to the numbers of shares and share prices
retroactively reflect post-split activity.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity from
the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized
gains and losses, if any, reported in a separate component of stockholders'
equity. As of December 31, 1998, the amortized cost of the Company investments
approximated their fair value. Realized gains and losses and declines in value
judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included
in income. The Company has not experienced any realized gains or losses on its
cash equivalents. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method. Cash and cash

equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 1998 and 1997 consists of
the following in thousands:

Deferred Offering Costs
Costs related to offering of the Company stock were deferred until the
completion of the offering and were offset against proceeds from the offering.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets which range from four to five years. Assets recorded under
capital leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the useful life or the lease term.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue earned under collaborative research agreements is recognized as the
related services are performed and research expenses are incurred. Amounts
received in advance of services to be performed are recorded as deferred revenue
until the related expenses are incurred. Non-refundable milestone payments,
which do not require the Company to perform additional services, are recognized
as revenue in the period earned. The Company has not received nor recognized as
revenue any milestone payments to date.
The Company has received government grants which support the Company
research effort in specific research projects. These grants generally provide
for reimbursement of approved costs incurred as defined in the various awards.
Net Loss Per Share
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128 Earnings Per Share SFAS 128 and the
provisions of Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
98. SFAS 128 requires the presentation of basic earnings loss per share and
diluted earnings loss per share, if more dilutive, for all periods presented.
In accordance with SFAS 128, basic net loss per share has been computed
using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1998
The following table sets forth the calculation of basic net loss per share
in thousands, except per share amounts:
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1998    1997    1996
Net loss attributable to common
$14,550  $4,113  $3,863
Weighted average shares of common stock
3,244    100     73
Basic net loss per common share. $ 449  $4113  $5292
Pro forma net loss per share has been computed as described above and also
gives effect to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock that
automatically converted upon completion of the Company initial public offering
using the as-if converted method from the original date of issuance. Pro forma
net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 was $343 and
$195, respectively. Shares used in computing the pro forma net loss per share
were 4,248,000 and 2,109,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
Diluted net loss per share has not been presented separately as, due to the
Company net loss position, it is anti-dilutive. Had the Company been in a net
income position at December 31, 1998 and 1997, shares used in calculating
diluted earnings per share would have included the effect of an additional
2,410,000 and 1,290,000 shares related to the Company outstanding stock
options and warrants prior to the application of the treasury stock method,
respectively.
Accounting for Stock Options and Warrants
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, the Company has elected
to account for stock options and purchase rights granted to employees using the
intrinsic value method and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation expense
for options and purchase rights granted to employees with exercise prices which
are not less than fair value of the underlying Common Stock.
For equity awards to non-employees, including lenders and lessors, the
Company applies the Black-Scholes method to determine the fair value of such
instruments. The value is recognized as expense over the period of services
received or the term of the related financing.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of

3. DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS
In January 1998, the Company entered into a collaboration with Dainippon
for two of its targets in the antibacterial program. As part of the Dainippon
Collaboration, Dainippon has agreed to provide the Company with research support
payments over three years, and fund additional research and development at
Dainippon. In February 1998, Dainippon made a payment of $2,000,000, of which
$1,833,000 was recognized by the Company as revenue through December 31, 1998,
based on costs incurred during the period. Collaborative research payments from
Dainippon are non-refundable. The Company may also be entitled to receive
milestone payments upon the achievement of mostly late-stage clinical and
regulatory milestones in the amount of up to $10,000,000, consisting of up to
$5,000,000 in milestones through approval in Japan and an additional $5,000,000
through approval in one other major market territory, for each product developed
through the collaboration. RiboGene also has the right to co-promote, in Europe
and the U.S., any products resulting from the collaboration. In connection with
this agreement, Dainippon also purchased 756,144 shares of Series G preferred
stock, which converted to common stock upon the Company initial public
offering see Note 6.
In September, 1998, the Company issued Dainippon 230,000 shares of common
stock in exchange for an increased royalty interest in the sales from future
products, as defined in the collaboration agreement between the Company and
Dainippon. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a $747,000
one-time non-cash charge to research and development expense during 1998,
representing the fair market value of the common stock at the date of issuance.
In July, 1998, the Company entered into an option and license agreement
with Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation Roberts for the development of
Emitasol, an intranasally administered drug being developed for the treatment of
diabetic gastroparesis and for the prevention of delayed onset emesis. Roberts
also made a $10,000,000 equity investment in RiboGene by purchasing 1,428,572
shares of Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock the Series A
Preferred Stock at $700 per share. Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
are entitled to non-cumulative dividends, when and if declared by the Board of
Directors, and have a liquidation preference, prior to any declared dividends,
equal to the original issue price of $700 per share. The Series A Preferred
Stock is convertible into common stock on a one-for-one basis, provided,
however, that on or following each of the first three annual anniversary dates
of the stock issuance, the holders of the Series A
44
47
RIBOGENE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1998
Preferred Stock can only convert up to 33%, 50% and 100% of their shares,
respectively. Additionally, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may request
that the Company register up to 20% of the converted shares in any twelve-month
period.
Under the terms of the option and license agreement, Roberts will conduct
clinical trials using Emitasol and, if those are successful, submit a New Drug
Application NDA for Emitasol. If FDA regulatory approval is obtained,
Roberts will have 60 days to exercise an exclusive option for a license to
market Emitasol in North America. Roberts has agreed to make a payment to
RiboGene of up to $10,000,000 upon the exercise of the option and to pay a
royalty on product sales. RiboGene will provide up to $7,000,000 in funding for
the development of Emitasol through completion of Phase III trials and the
submission of an NDA, with the balance, if any, provided by Roberts. As of
December 31, 1998, the Company had recognized approximately $400,000 of
development expenses for costs incurred by Roberts through that date.
In July, 1998, the Company entered into a material transfer, screening and
collaboration agreement with EnzyMed to screen and test compounds provided by
EnzyMed. The Company and EnzyMed will develop a mutually agreed upon plan for
the development of compounds that meet certain criteria. Future revenues, if
any, resulting from the sale of any compound discovered as part of this
collaboration will be shared by each party by a predetermined formula based on a
percentage of risk taken by each party. The agreement may be terminated at any
time upon written notice which would be effective 30 days after the end of any
current four-month screening period.
In September 1997, the Company entered into a material transfer and
screening agreement with ArQule, Inc. ArQule a combinatorial chemistry
company which grants the Company access to ArQule proprietary combinatorial
chemistry libraries. The Company is actively screening compounds supplied by
ArQule in certain of its assays. If the Company detects activity with one of
these compounds, the Company will have an opportunity to enter into a
collaboration agreement for such compounds. This agreement can be terminated by
the Company upon 30 days notice without any further obligation.
In April 1996, the Company entered into collaborative research and license
agreements with Abbott Laboratories Abbott to discover and develop
antifungal products identified using the Company drug discovery technology.
This agreement granted Abbott the exclusive worldwide right to develop and
market antifungal products discovered with the Company. Abbott agreed to make
contract research payments of up to $5,000,000 for the Company antifungal
research activity over a three-year period. Specifically, the Company
activities included screening compound samples, the identification of new
targets and the design and implementation of assays incorporating these targets.
The Company had no obligation to incur expenses in excess of the funds provided
by Abbott. During 1996 and 1997, Abbott made payments of $1,668,000 in each year
pursuant to this agreement, of which $1,112,000 and $1,668,000, respectively,
was recognized as revenue based on costs incurred during the period.
Collaborative research payments from Abbott were non-refundable. On February 6,
1998, Abbott notified the Company of its intent to end its research
collaboration with the Company effective April 8, 1998. During 1998, the Company
recognized $736,000 in revenue from Abbott, consisting of $556,000 which had
been deferred at December 31, 1997 and a final additional payment of $180,000.
There are no future performance obligations of either the Company or Abbott.
In April 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with the University of
Washington, which was amended in October 1997, pursuant to which RiboGene
received an exclusive worldwide license to certain patent rights and technology.
Under the agreement, the Company paid an upfront license fee and has agreed to
pay a minimal quarterly license maintenance fee and a milestone payment of
$250,000 upon the approval of an NDA for a compound developed using the licensed
patent rights. Once a compound is selected for development, the Company will be
obligated to complete certain development milestones at its own expense. To
date, no compound has been selected for development.

4. NOTES PAYABLE
In December 1998, the Company received $5,000,000 in proceeds from the
issuance of a long-term note payable to a bank. The note requires monthly
interest only payments at prime plus 10%. The rate at December 31, 1998 was
875%. The principal is due at the end of the three-year term. The loan is
collateralized by a perfected security interest in all the unencumbered assets
of the Company and requires that the Company maintain its depository accounts
with the bank with a minimum of $5,000,000 in aggregate cash and depository
balances. The Company is also required to comply with financial covenants based
on certain ratios. At December 31, 1998, the Company was in compliance with all
required covenants. In connection with this financing arrangement, the Company
issued to the placement agent a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $250 per share. The warrant expires in December
2003. The warrant has been assigned a value of $80,000, which is being amortized
over the term of the loan along with an additional $300,000 in placement and
bank fees paid by the Company. The valuation of the warrant was determined using
the Black-Scholes method with the following assumptions: an expected life of 5
years; an expected volatility factor of 07; risk free interest rate of 5%; a
dividend yield of 0%; and an estimated fair value of the underlying Common Stock
at the date of grant of $294.
In September 1998, the Company entered into a $2,000,000 arrangement for
financing capital purchases. The loan is collateralized by the underlying
equipment, payable over a four-year term at an interest rate of 72% plus an
index rate based on U.S. Treasury Notes. At December 31, 1998, $620,000 was
outstanding under notes from this arrangement at an interest rate of 1272%.
5. COMMITMENTS
The Company leases certain facilities and laboratory and office equipment.
Future minimum lease payments under such noncancelable leases at December 31,
1998 are as follows:

Rent expense for operating leases was approximately $891,000, $347,000 and
$213,000 in the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. In
1997, the Company entered into a facility lease which provides for scheduled
rent increases annually over the 15-year term. The rent is being recognized as
expense on a straight-line basis and the actual cash flow is included in the
future minimum lease payment schedule above. In connection with the facility
lease, the Company issued to the landlord a six year warrant to purchase 17,850
shares of Common Stock at $3151 per share. The warrant was assigned a value of
$290,000 which is being amortized over the vesting period of the warrant. Such
valuation was determined using the Black-Scholes method with the following
assumptions: an expected life of six years; an expected volatility factor of
46

RIBOGENE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1998
07; a risk-free interest rate of 6%; a dividend yield of 0%; and an estimated
fair value of the underlying common stock of $3000.
In January 1994, the Company entered into a five-year consulting agreement
that provides for payments of $50,000 per quarter from January 1995 through
December 1999. In 1995, the Company determined it would no longer require the
services of the consultant at a level commensurate with the amounts payable in
1996 through 1999, and therefore the remaining present value of the unpaid
balance discounted at 105% amounting to $646,000 was recognized as expense in
the accompanying statement of operations.
6. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Initial Public Offering
In June 1998, the Company consummated an initial public offering the
Offering with the issuance of 2,300,000 shares of common stock at a price of
$700 per share. Concurrently with the closing of the Offering, the Company sold
571,429 additional shares of common stock at $700 per share to Abbott in a
private placement. Proceeds from the Offering and private placement net of
issuance costs were $16,221,000.
The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment in the State of Delaware to
effect a one-for-14 reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of common
stock, and common stock options and warrants in May 1998. As a result of the
reverse stock split, each share of Series A through E and G preferred stock
converted into 00714 of a share of common stock. Each share of Series F
preferred stock converted into 06429 of a share of common stock. The Series F
preferred stock contained certain antidilution provisions that resulted in the
Series F preferred stock holders receiving an additional 1,141,317 shares of
common stock upon conversion. The value of this additional common stock 7,989,000, has been deemed to be equivalent of a preferred stock dividend. The
Company recorded the deemed dividend at the time of conversion by offsetting
charges and credits to additional paid in capital, without any effect on total
stockholders' equity. The amount increased the loss allocable to common
stockholders, in the calculation of basic net loss per share for the year ended
December 31, 1998. Following the Offering, the Company filed a Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the authorized stock of the Company such
that the Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $0001 par value
preferred stock, and 30,000,000 shares of $0001 par value common stock.
Preferred Stock
At December 31, 1998, 1,428,572 shares of Series A non-voting convertible
preferred stock were issued and outstanding, pursuant to a stock purchase
agreement with Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation see Note 3.
Placement Agent Unit Options
In connection with the sale of Series F preferred stock in 1997, the
Company issued the placement agent an option to purchase units the Placement
Agent Units that consisted of one share of Series F preferred stock and one
Class A common stock warrant. In addition, the Company entered into a two-year
Financial Advisory Agreement with the placement agent pursuant to which the
Company issued the placement agent options to purchase additional Placement
Agent Units. As a result of certain anti-dilution provisions upon the closing of
the Company initial public offering, options to acquire a total of 733,755
shares of common stock and 40,739 Class A Warrants with an aggregate option
exercise price of approximately $708,000 became exercisable. The options to
acquire Placement Agent Units issued pursuant to the Financial Advisory
Agreement have been assigned a value of $1,300,000 which has been expensed and
included in the loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 1997, as
the Company did not believe it would receive future services commensurate with
this amount. The value of the Placement Agent Units was determined at the date

DECEMBER 31, 1998
of issuance using the Black-Scholes method with valuation assumptions as
follows: expected life of 10 years; risk free interest rate of 6%; an expected
volatility factor of 5; a dividend yield of 0%; and a fair value of the
underlying units of $434. The fair value of the underlying units was determined
by reference to the price paid by investors in the Series F preferred stock
financing, giving consideration to the fact that each Placement Agent Unit
consisted of two shares of Series F preferred stock and one Class A warrant. The
Company also accrued an additional $96,000 of fees due to the placement agent.
Warrants
From time to time, the Company issued warrants in connection with equity,
financing, debt, and lease arrangements. The Company had outstanding warrants at
December 31, 1998 as follows:
WEIGHTED AVERAGE  WEIGHTED AVERAGE

Total. 363,124     $1110        32
At December 31, 1997 and 1996, there were outstanding warrants to acquire,
328,224 and 108,348 shares of common stock on an as-converted to common stock
basis, respectively, at weighted average exercise prices per common share of
$1222 and $1464 respectively. During 1998, 15,100 warrants expired, and no
warrants were exercised, cancelled or forfeited in 1996, 1997 or 1998. All
warrants were fully exercisable upon issuance.
Stock Option Plans
For employees and consultants, the Company has three stock option plans
the Plans, the 1993 Stock Plan, the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan and the 1998
Non-Officer Employee Stock Option Plan. Under the terms of the Plans, the Board
of Directors may grant stock purchase rights and stock options. Stock purchase
rights may not be issued at less than 85% of the fair value of the common stock
at the date of grant and generally provide the Company with a repurchase right
in the event of termination of employment which lapses over periods specified by
the Board of Directors. Options granted pursuant to the Plans may be either
incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. Incentive stock options may be granted to employees with
exercise prices of no less than the fair market value and nonstatutory options
may be granted to employees or consultants at exercise prices of no less than
85% of the fair value of the common stock on the grant date, as determined by
the Board of Directors. If, at the time the Company grants an option, the
optionee directly or by attribution owns stock possessing more than 10% of the
total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, the option
price shall be at least 110% of the fair market value and the option shall not
be exercised more than five years after the date of grant. Except as noted
above, options expire no more than 10 years after the date of grant or earlier
if employment is terminated. Options become exercisable as determined by the
Board of Directors, generally over a period of four years. Through December 31,
1998, a total of 1,695,357 shares have been reserved for issuance under the
Plans.
Additionally, the Company has a stock option plan for its Board of
Directors, the 1997 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors'
Plan. The Directors' Plan provides for automatic grants of options to purchase
shares of common stock to non-employee directors of the Company. There are
80,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Directors' Plan.

In December 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the cancellation and
regrant of employee options to purchase 206,900 shares of common stock effective
as of the close of business on December 11, 1998 at an exercise price equal to
the then fair value of the Company common stock of $2375 per share. Under the
terms of the option exchange, the new options maintain the same vesting and
expiration terms. The Company officers did not participate in the option
exchange.
Through December 31, 1998, the Board of Directors granted 56,007 common
stock purchase rights under the Plans, all of which have been exercised for cash
and promissory notes. Of this amount, 5,146 shares have been repurchased through
December 31, 1998 and 14,288 shares are subject to the Company repurchase
right or vesting at December 31, 1998 which generally lapses over four years.
The promissory notes bear interest at 529% to 673%. At December 31, 1998,
303,660 shares were available for future grant or sale.
During 1998, the Board of Directors granted the Company officers, 110,000
shares of restricted stock and 430,000 shares of incentive stock options out of
the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan. 129,000 of such options are subject to
stockholder approval. The incentive stock options have an exercise price equal
to the grant date fair value of the Company common stock of $250 per share.
The restricted stock and the incentive stock options are subject to vesting
based on the performance of the Company common stock, such that the initial
25% is vested when the target stock price of $500 is attained as measured by a
90 day trailing period, and then for each $100 further increase in stock price,
an additional 25% of the shares shall vest. The restricted stock and incentive
options will automatically vest after seven years. The Company will record
compensation expense for the restricted stock as the shares vest. All of the
restricted stock is subject to the Company repurchase right, which lapses over
the vesting period.

At December 31, 1997, 94,916 options were exercisable.
For certain options granted in 1997 and 1998, the Company has recognized
deferred compensation expense of approximately $1,480,000 and $635,000,
respectively. These amounts are being amortized to expense over the vesting
period of the options. A total of $118,000 and $461,000 was amortized to
compensation expense in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
During 1996, the Company adopted SFAS 123. Using the Black-Scholes method
to value options and stock purchase rights granted to employees subsequent to
its initial public offering and the minimum value method prior to the offering
resulted in a pro forma net loss of $14,930,000 and $4,175,000 and a pro forma
net loss per share of $460 and $4175 for the year ended December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The effect on historical net loss and net loss per share
amounts in 1996 was immaterial and has not be presented. In future years, the
applications of SFAS 123 may result in a pro forma net loss which is materially
different from actual reported results. The valuation methods were applied using
the following weighted average assumptions for 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998
respectively; risk free interest rates of 634%, 635%, 60% and 50%, an
expected option life of 5 years and no annual dividends. Since newly public
companies do not have a statistical measure of historical volatility, an
expected volatility factor of 07 was used in 1998, which is comparable to
similarly situated companies in the biotechnology industry. The weighted-average
fair value of options and stock purchase rights granted with exercise prices
equal to the fair value of the Company stock on the date of grant during 1995,
1996, 1997 and 1998 was $085, $085, $080 and $258, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In March 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the Purchase Plan covering an aggregate of 600,000 shares of common
stock. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock
through payroll deductions at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the fair
market value at the beginning or end of the applicable offering period. No
shares were issued under the Purchase Plan through December 31, 1998.
