Item 8.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
COMPANY REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JRM has prepared the consolidated financial statements and related financial
information included in this report. JRM has the primary responsibility for the
financial statements and other financial information and for ascertaining that
the data fairly reflects its financial position and results of operations. The
financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and necessarily reflect informed estimates and judgments
by appropriate officers of JRM with appropriate consideration given to
materiality.
JRM believes that it maintains an internal control structure designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized
use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to
produce financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The concept of reasonable assurance is based on the recognition
that the cost of an internal control structure must not exceed the related
benefits. Although internal control procedures are designed to achieve these
objectives, it must be recognized that fraud, errors or illegal acts may
nevertheless occur. JRM seeks to assure the objectivity and integrity of its
accounts by its selection of qualified personnel, by organizational arrangements
that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and by the establishment
and communication of sound business policies and procedures throughout the
organization. JRM believes that its internal control structure provides
reasonable assurance that fraud, errors or illegal acts that could be material
to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected.
JRM accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by its
independent auditors, who provide JRM with expert advice on the application of
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to JRM business and also provide
an objective assessment of the degree to which JRM meets its responsibility for
the fairness of financial reporting. They regularly evaluate the internal
control structure and perform such tests and other procedures as they deem
necessary to reach and express an opinion on the fairness of the financial
statements. The report of the independent auditors appears elsewhere herein.
The Board of Directors pursues its responsibility for JRM consolidated
financial statements through its Audit Committee, which is composed solely of
directors who are not officers or employees of JRM or its parent, International.
The functions of the Audit Committee include the review of matters relating to
the quality of financial reporting and internal control structure and the
nature, extent and results of the audit effort. In addition, the Audit
Committee is responsible for recommending the engagement of independent auditors
for JRM to the Board of Directors, who in turn submit the engagement to the
stockholders for their approval. The independent auditors have free access to
the Audit Committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders
J. Ray McDermott, S.A. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of J. Ray McDermott,
S.A. as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
income loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended March 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of J. Ray McDermott,
S.A. at March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                        ERNST & YOUNG LLP New Orleans, Louisiana

J. RAY McDERMOTT, S.A.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 1998
- 
NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JRM, and its
subsidiaries and controlled joint ventures. Investments in joint ventures and
other entities which JRM does not control, but has significant influence over,
are accounted for on the equity method. Differences between the cost of equity
method investments and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of the
investees are amortized systematically to income. All significant intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Certain amounts previously
reported have been reclassified to conform with the presentation at March 31,
1998.
Unless the context otherwise requires, hereinafter JRM means J. Ray McDermott,
S.A. and its consolidated subsidiaries; International means McDermott
International, Inc., a Panamanian corporation that is the parent company of the
McDermott group of companies and the majority owner of JRM; and McDermott
International means the consolidated enterprise. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Accounting Changes
Earnings Per Share - In December 1997, JRM adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128
replaced the previously reported primary and fully diluted earnings per share
with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share,
basic earnings per share excludes the dilutive effects of options, warrants, and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All previously reported
earnings per share amounts have been restated to conform to the new
requirements.
Segments - During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, JRM adopted SFAS No.
131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises
report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and
requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating
segments in interim financial reports. SFAS No. 131 also establishes standards
for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major
customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect results of operations or
financial position, but did affect the disclosure of segment information.
28
Investments
JRM investments, primarily government obligations and other debt securities,
are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders' equity.
Investment securities available for current operations are classified in the
balance sheet as current assets while securities held for long-term investment
purposes are classified as non-current assets. The amortized cost of debt
securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization is included in interest income. Realized gains
and losses are included in other income. The cost of securities sold is based
on the specific identification method. Interest on securities is included in
interest income.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, other than operations in highly
inflationary economies, are translated into U.S. Dollars at current exchange
rates and income statement items are translated at average exchange rates for
the year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign currency
financial statements are recorded in a separate component of equity. Foreign
currency transaction adjustments are reported in income. Included in Other
Income Expense are transaction gains losses of $4,520,000, $1,108,000, and
$1,916,000 for fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. In fiscal year
1998, a gain of $1,005,000 was transferred from currency translation adjustment
and included in gain loss on asset disposals and impairments - net due to the
sale of a foreign investment.
Contracts and Revenue Recognition
Contract revenues and related costs are principally recognized on a percentage
of completion method for individual contracts or components thereof based upon
work performed or a cost to cost method, as applicable to the product or
activity involved. Revenues and related costs so recorded, plus accumulated
contract costs that exceed amounts invoiced to customers under the terms of the
contracts, are included in Contracts in Progress. Billings that exceed
accumulated contract costs and revenues and costs recognized under percentage of
completion are included in Advance Billings on Contracts. Most long-term
contracts have provisions for progress payments. There are no unbilled revenues
which will not be billed. Contract price and cost estimates are reviewed
periodically as the work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the
percentage of completion are reflected in income in the period when such
estimates are revised. Provisions are made currently for all known or
anticipated losses. Variations from estimated contract performance could result
in a material adjustment to operating results for any fiscal quarter or year.
Claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in contract
revenues when collection is probable. Certain partnering contracts contain a
risk and reward element, whereby a portion of total compensation is tied to
overall performance of the alliance partners.

In thousands
Retainages                      $  14,945  $  13,693
All of the 1998 retainages are expected to be collected within the next year.
Depreciation, Maintenance and Repairs and Drydocking Expenses
Except for major marine vessels, property, plant and equipment is depreciated on
the straight-line method, using estimated economic useful lives of 8 to 30 years
for buildings and 2 to 20 years for machinery and equipment. Major marine
vessels are depreciated on the units-of-production method based on the
utilization of each vessel. Depreciation expense calculated under the units-of-
production method may be less than, equal to, or greater than depreciation
expense calculated under the straight-line method in any period. The annual
depreciation based on utilization of each vessel will not be less than the
greater of 25% of annual straight-line depreciation, or 50% of cumulative
straight-line depreciation.
Maintenance, repairs and renewals which do not materially prolong the useful
life of an asset are expensed as incurred except for drydocking costs for the
marine fleet, which are estimated and accrued over the period of time between
drydockings, and such accruals are charged to operations currently.
Amortization of Excess Cost Over Fair Value of Net Assets of Purchased
Businesses
Excess of cost over fair value of net assets of purchased businesses at March
31, 1998 primarily pertains to the acquisitions of Talleres Navales del Golfo,
S.A. de C.V. and Northern Ocean Services Limited and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 10 years.
30
Management periodically reviews goodwill to assess recoverability, and
impairments would be recognized in operating results if a permanent diminution
in value were to occur. During fiscal year 1998, management concluded goodwill
associated with the acquisition of Offshore Pipelines, Inc. OPI in 1995 no
longer had value and recorded a charge for the remaining goodwill of
$262,901,000 see Note 8.
Capitalization of Interest Cost
In fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, total interest cost incurred was
$31,687,000, $42,295,000 and $44,632,000, respectively, of which $894,000 717,000 and $1,325,000, respectively, was capitalized.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments, with maturities of three months
or less when purchased, which are not held as part of the investment portfolio.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivatives, primarily forward exchange contracts, are utilized to minimize
exposure and reduce risk from foreign exchange fluctuations in the regular
course of business. Gains and losses relating to qualifying hedges of firm
commitments are deferred and recognized in income or as adjustments of carrying
amounts when the hedged transactions occur. Gains and losses on forward
exchange contracts which hedge foreign currency assets or liabilities are
recognized in income as incurred. Such amounts effectively offset gains and
losses on the foreign currency assets or liabilities that are hedged.
Stock-Based Compensation
JRM follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for
its employee stock plans. Under APB 25, if the exercise price of the Company
employee stock options equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock
on the measurement date, no compensation expense is recognized. If the
measurement date is later than the date of grant, compensation expense is
recorded to the measurement date based on the quoted market price of the
underlying stock at the end of each period.
NOTE 2 - ACQUISITIONS
During fiscal year 1998, JRM acquired a controlling interest in Talleres Navales
del Golfo, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican shipyard, a 100% interest in Menck GmbH, a
manufacturer of marine hammers, and the remaining interest in McDermott
Engineering Houston, LLC, an engineering joint venture, from International for
an aggregate purchase price of $14,543,000. These acquisitions have been
accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests and accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements have been restated.

NOTE 3 - INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
Transactions with unconsolidated affiliates included sales to $140,389,000 110,150,000 and $134,358,000 in fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively,
including approximately $10,491,000, $9,609,000 and $44,491,000, respectively,
attributable to leasing activities and purchases from $17,003,000, $8,765,000,
and $9,054,000 in fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively these
entities. Included in accounts payable at March 31, 1998 and 1997 were
$16,959,000 and $11,792,000, respectively, of payables to unconsolidated
affiliates.
During fiscal year 1998, JRM and its joint venture partner, Heerema Offshore
Construction Group, Inc. Heerema, terminated the HeereMac joint venture.
Each party had a 50% interest in the joint venture, and Heerema had
responsibility for its day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the termination,
Heerema acquired and assumed JRM 50% interest in the joint venture in exchange
for cash of $318,500,000 and title to several pieces of equipment, including two
launch barges and the derrick barge 101, a 3500-ton lift capacity, semi-
submersible derrick barge. The consideration received included a distribution
of earnings of the HeereMac joint venture and payment of principal and interest
under a promissory note previously due to JRM approximately $100,000,000. As
a result of the termination, a gain on asset disposal of $224,472,000 and a
distribution of earnings of $61,637,000 were recorded.
During fiscal year 1997, JRM changed from the equity to the cost method of
accounting for its investment in the HeereMac joint venture as a result of JRM
determination that it was unable to exercise significant influence over
HeereMac operating and financial policies. Equity income of HeereMac was
$1,083,000 in fiscal year 1996.
In fiscal year 1997, JRM realized a gain of $16,682,000 on the sale of a marine
vessel by HeereMac on behalf of JRM. During fiscal year 1996, JRM sold to the
HeereMac joint venture the major marine vessels that it had been leasing to the
joint venture. JRM received cash of $135,969,000, including a $30,000,000
advance deposit on the sale of certain marine equipment which was completed
during fiscal year 1997, and a 775% note receivable of $105,000,000 and
recorded a deferred gain of $103,239,000, which was being amortized over
HeereMac depreciable lives of the vessels prior to the change to the cost
method of accounting for JRM investment in HeereMac. Subsequent to the
change, the deferred gain 
32
was recognized by JRM as the note was repaid. The note receivable $92,500,000
at March 31, 1997, net of the deferred gain $90,803,000 at March 31, 1997 was
included in investment in unconsolidated affiliates. In addition to the vessel
sale in fiscal year 1996, JRM received $37,097,000 as a return of capital from
the HeereMac joint venture.
At March 31, 1998 and 1997, property, plant and equipment included $137,513,000
and $141,409,000, and accumulated depreciation included $113,528,000 and
$102,242,000, respectively, of marine equipment that is leased to unconsolidated
investees. Dividends received from unconsolidated investees accounted for by
the equity method were $1,290,000 and $2,291,000 in fiscal years 1998 and 1996,
respectively. Undistributed earnings in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for
by the equity method were $16,238,000 and $12,937,000, respectively, at March
31, 1998 and 1997.

Subsequent Events - On April 3, 1998, JRM and ETPM S.A. terminated their
worldwide McDermott-ETPM joint venture. Pursuant to the termination, JRM
received net cash of approximately $105,000,000 and ETPM, S.A. derrick/lay
barge 1601 and minority ownership in McDermott-ETPM East, Inc. and McDermott-
ETPM Far East, Inc. ETPM S.A. received JRM lay barge 200 and ownership in
McDermott Subsea Constructors Limited and McDermott-ETPM 
33
West, Inc. The Consolidated Statement of Income Loss for fiscal years 1998,
1997, and 1996, respectively, includes revenues of $74,096,000, $44,033,000 and
$23,290,000 and operating income loss of $18,751,000, $22,956,000 and
$1,086,000 attributable to operations transferred to ETPM S.A.
Subsequent to the fiscal year end, JRM Malaysian joint venture sold two
combination pipelay and derrick barges. The joint venture, in which JRM holds
a 49% interest, received approximately $47,000,000 in cash for the barges.
NOTE 4 - INCOME TAXES
Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates in the
countries in which operations are conducted. All income has been earned outside
of Panama and JRM is not subject to income tax in Panama on income earned
outside of Panama. Therefore, there is no expected relationship between the
provision for income taxes and income before income taxes. The major reason for
the variations in such relationships is that income is earned within and subject
to the taxation laws of various countries, each of which has a regime of
taxation which varies from that of any other country not only with respect to
nominal rate but also with respect to the allowability of deductions, credits
and other benefits and because the proportional extent to which income is
earned in, and subject to tax by, any particular country or countries varies
from year to year. JRM and certain of its subsidiaries keep books and file tax
returns on the completed contract method of accounting.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Significant
components of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 1998 and 1997
were as follows                    34

Provision for Income Taxes    $34,851   $ 11,732  $ 5,677
The current provision for other than U.S. income taxes in 1998, 1997 and 1996
includes a reduction of $10,427,000, $2,021,000 and $3,763,000, respectively,
for the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards. Initial recognition of OPI
pre-acquisition tax benefits in fiscal year 1997 resulted in a reduction of
excess cost over fair value of assets acquired of $3,115,000.
JRM has provided a valuation allowance $17,196,000 at March 31, 1998 for
deferred tax assets which cannot be realized through carrybacks and future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Management believes that
remaining deferred tax assets are realizable through carrybacks and future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.
An uncertainty that affects the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
the risk of incurring losses in the future. This factor has been considered in
determining the valuation allowance. Management will continue to assess the
adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.
JRM would be subject to U.S. withholding taxes on distributions of earnings from
its U.S. subsidiaries. No U.S. withholding taxes have been provided as these
earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested.

During fiscal year 1997, JRM paid a $231,000,000 note payable to International
and purchased from International certain diving support equipment and systems
for $3,573,000 and nine cranes for use in JRM fabrication and construction
activities for $8,295,000. During fiscal year 1998, a tax adjustment of
$1,128,000 on the above purchase was included in Capital in Excess of Par Value.
Under a non-competition agreement entered into in connection with the
acquisition of OPI, a director who resigned in April 1996 received $1,500,000 in
fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996 and will receive additional payments of
$1,500,000 per year over the next two years.
In fiscal year 1995, JRM entered into an office sublease with an affiliate of
one of its directors who resigned in April 1996. Such sublease expired in
March 1997. During fiscal years 1997 and 1996, the affiliate paid $216,000 and
$185,000, respectively, under the sublease. Under another agreement, JRM paid
$576,000 to the affiliate in each of fiscal years 1997 and 1996 and reimbursed
the affiliate for out-of-pocket expenses for the management and operation of
JRM offshore producing oil and gas property. Also during fiscal year 1996,
JRM fabricated a caisson for the affiliate for $84,000. In addition, JRM
received approximately $2,000,000 from the affiliate during fiscal year 1996
pursuant to a contract to refurbish, transport and install an offshore jacket
and deck.
JRM entered into agreements with an affiliate of another director whose term as
director ended in August 1997 pursuant to which JRM acquired interests in
certain offshore oil and gas property. During fiscal year 1996, JRM paid
$2,036,000 to the affiliate under the agreements in connection with the
acquisition of its interests and the development of such property. During
fiscal year 1996, JRM sold its interest in the property to the affiliate in
exchange for an $8,000,000 convertible production payment relating to such
property. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements entered into in connection
with such sale, JRM received a right to a production payment that allows it to
share in up to $8,000,000 of the net proceeds on any production from the
property based upon a percentage of its original interest in such property. In
December 1995, this property was placed on production and JRM earned
approximately $1,262,000, $1,093,000 and $179,000 in fiscal years 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively, 
37
under these agreements. In addition, during fiscal year 1998, JRM sold its
investment in common stock of this affiliate and its interest in a limited
partnership which is also an affiliate of this director. JRM also entered into
agreements with two affiliates of the same former director to design, fabricate
and install several offshore pipelines or structures. The value of these
agreements was approximately $82,000,000. At March 31, 1997, all work under
these agreements had been completed and invoiced.
McDermott International provides administrative services to JRM under a service
agreement. These services include, but are not limited to: accounting,
treasury, tax administration and other financial services; human relations;
public relations; corporate secretarial; and corporate officer services. The
cost of these services to JRM was $13,148,000, $11,900,000 and $11,900,000 for
fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. McDermott International also
provides other administrative services which are billed directly to JRM. These
services include, but are not limited to, telecommunications and automation.
The cost of these services to JRM was $5,197,000, $6,629,000 including
$2,087,000 for corporate officer severance and $6,615,000 for fiscal years
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Certain officers and employees of JRM participate in certain benefit plans which
involve the issuance of International Common Stock.

During fiscal year 1997, JRM issued $250,000,000 principal amount 9375% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2006 9375% Notes. The 9375% Notes are redeemable,
for cash, at the option of JRM in whole or in part, at any time on or after July
15, 2001 at a price of 104688% of the principal amount, and thereafter at
prices declining annually to 100% of the principal amount on or after July 15,
2004.
Maturities of long-term debt during the five fiscal years subsequent to March
31, 1998 are as follows: 1999 - $29,021,000; 2000 - $721,000; 2001 - $38,000;
2002 - $38,000; 2003 - $39,000.
At March 31, 1998 and 1997, JRM had available various uncommitted short-term
lines of credit from banks totaling $25,234,000 and $43,091,000, respectively.
Borrowings by JRM against these lines of credit at March 31, 1998 and 1997 were
$2,251,000 and $28,610,000, respectively. JRM is also a party to an unsecured
and committed revolving credit facility the JRM Revolver. There were no
borrowings outstanding at March 31, 1998 and 1997 under the JRM Revolver. As a
condition to borrowing under the JRM Revolver, JRM must comply with certain
covenant requirements. Presently, JRM cannot satisfy these requirements and
cannot borrow under the JRM Revolver. The JRM Revolver also limits the amount
of funds which JRM can borrow from other sources and JRM is presently at these
limits. The JRM Revolver will expire on June 8, 1998. JRM is currently
negotiating a new three year unsecured committed revolving credit and letter of
credit facility.
JRM is restricted, as a result of covenants in its indenture relating to its
9375% Notes, from paying cash dividends on, or repurchasing or redeeming, its
capital stock including the shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock
held by International, or in transferring funds through unsecured loans to or
investments in International. At March 31, 1998, JRM could pay cash dividends
on, or repurchase shares of, its capital stock including shares held by
International in the amount of $37,633,000, could pay up to an additional
$9,600,000 of cash dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock held by
International, and could make unsecured loans to or investments in International
of approximately $30,000,000. Additionally under such indenture, JRM is
required to offer to purchase its outstanding 9375% Notes at 100% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, to the extent that it has
proceeds from certain asset sales and 
39
dispositions equal to or exceeding $25,000,000 that it has not used to
permanently reduce certain senior or other indebtedness or reinvested in its
business within a specified time period, generally 18 months, following each
such asset sale or disposition. Currently, JRM has approximately $240,000,000 in
proceeds from such asset sales and dispositions, which, if not used for
repayment of debt or reinvested as described above, would be subject to this
obligation commencing June 1999.
NOTE 7 - PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension Plans - JRM provides retirement benefits through employee participation
in two non-contributory pension plans for substantially all of its salaried
employees, except certain non-resident alien employees of foreign subsidiaries
who are not citizens of a European Community country or who do not earn income
in the United States or the United Kingdom. Plan benefits are based on final
average compensation and years of service. JRM funding policy is to fund the
applicable pension plan to meet minimum funding requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and to fund the other pension plan as
recommended by the respective plan actuary in accordance with applicable law.
At January 1, 1998 and 1997, approximately one-half of total plan assets were
invested in listed stocks and bonds. The remaining assets were held in foreign
equity funds, U.S. Government securities and investments of a short-term nature.
JRM also provides benefits to employees in the United Kingdom through
participation of certain of its subsidiaries and affiliated companies in a
contributory pension plan sponsored by McDermott International.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits - JRM offers
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to substantially all of
its regular full-time employees who retire and receive retirement income from a
defined benefit pension plan funded by JRM, except certain 
42
non-resident alien retired employees who are not citizens of a European
Community country, or who, while employed, did not earn income in the United
States, Canada or the United Kingdom. JRM shares the cost of providing these
benefits, except for certain life insurance plans, with all affected retirees.
JRM does not fund any of these plans.

plans at March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

Service cost                    $ 1,065  $ 1,289  $  767

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost      $ 2,286  $ 2,822  $ 1,827
For measurement purposes, a weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in
the per capita cost of covered health care claims of 6-1/2% was assumed for
1998, 7-1/2% for 1997 and 10-3/4% for 1996. For 1999, a rate of 5-1/2% was
assumed. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4% in 2005 and remain at
that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing the assumed
health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of March 31, 1998 by
$3,039,000 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for fiscal year 1998 by $443,000.
43
Subsequent Event - Effective April 1, 1998, JRM terminated all postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for employees. As a result of the
termination, the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of JRM will
decrease. On the same date, the pension plan for the employees affected by the
termination were amended to increase the benefits payable to offset the cost of
postretirement health care and life insurance to the participants. As a result
of the amendment to the plan, the total projected benefit obligation of JRM will
increase. The decrease in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
will be measured against the increase in the total projected benefit obligation
of the pension plan, and any resulting gain or loss will be recognized in the
first quarter of fiscal year 1999. The actuarial calculations of the decrease
in the total accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the increase in
the projected benefit obligation of the pension plan have not yet been
finalized.
NOTE 8 - IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
During fiscal year 1998, management concluded that the goodwill associated with
the acquisition of OPI no longer had value and recorded a charge for the
remaining goodwill of $262,901,000. The decision was based on the lack of
volume related to OPI, the departure of key OPI executives from JRM and the
disposal of significant OPI joint ventures and major OPI vessels. Annual
amortization of the OPI goodwill was approximately $21,800,000.
During fiscal years 1998 and 1997, management identified certain long-lived
assets that are no longer expected to recover their entire carrying value
through future cash flows. The assets include non-core, surplus and obsolete
property and equipment. Fair value was generally determined based on sales
prices of comparable assets. Impairment losses to write down the property,
plant and equipment to estimated fair value totaled $2,891,000 and $19,228,000,
respectively, in fiscal years 1998 and 1997.
During fiscal year 1998, management decided to sell a Floating Production,
Storage and Offloading System FPSO. As a result, an impairment loss of
$7,000,000 was recognized to reduce the FPSO to its estimated fair value less
costs to sell. Prior to recognition of the impairment loss, the carrying value
of the FPSO was approximately $21,500,000. Excluding the impairment loss, net
income for fiscal year 1998 for the FPSO was $2,774,000. Management expects to
sell the FPSO within the next year.
During fiscal year 1997, management decided to sell a certain vessel and related
equipment of a non-core business and to sell or otherwise dispose of certain
other assets. As a result, impairment losses totaling $12,162,000 were
recognized to reduce the property and equipment to estimated fair values less
the costs to sell. Prior to recognition of the impairment losses, the carrying
value of these assets totaled approximately $18,950,000. Excluding the
impairment losses, results of operations for fiscal year 1997 for these assets
were not material. Substantially all of these assets were disposed of in fiscal
year 1998, with no significant gain or loss recognized.
NOTE 9 - CAPITAL STOCK
At March 31, 1998 and 1997, 14,634,966 and 15,172,402 shares, respectively, of
Common Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with the possible
conversion of Series A $225 Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Series A
Preferred Stock, the exercise of stock 
44
options and awards of restricted stock under JRM stock incentive plans and
contributions to the Thrift Plan described in Note 10.
At March 31, 1998 and 1997, 3,200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were
owned by International. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to one
vote per share, voting as a single class with the Common Stock, and a
liquidation preference of $5000 per share. Dividends on Series A Preferred
Stock are cumulative at the annual rate of $225 per share. Series A Preferred
Stock is redeemable for cash at the option of JRM, at any time through January
31, 2000 provided that the last reported sales price of JRM Common Stock in
its principal trading market for any 20 trading days within a period of 30
consecutive trading days is at least $5574, or any time after January 31, 2000
at a price equal to $5200 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. Each
share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 1794 shares of Common
Stock at any time after a call by JRM for redemption of any or all of the
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock or at any time after January 31, 2000.
During fiscal year 1998, JRM Board of Directors approved a plan to buy back a
limited number of shares of its Common Stock. Under the plan, JRM can purchase
up to two million shares of its Common Stock from time to time on the open
market or through negotiated transactions, depending on the availability of cash
and market conditions. JRM plan is also dependent on its ability to satisfy
its debt covenants. As of March 31, 1998, JRM had purchased 362,500 shares of
its Common Stock at an average share price of $3731 under the plan.
NOTE 10 - STOCK PLANS
A total of 3,217,039 shares of Common Stock are available for stock option
grants and restricted stock awards to officers and key employees under the
Executive Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan at March 31, 1998. The Plan
permits the grant of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options and
restricted stock. Options to purchase shares are granted at not less than 100%
of the fair market value on the date of the grant, become exercisable at such
time or times as determined when granted and expire not more than ten years
after the date of grant. Under the Plan, eligible employees may be granted
rights to purchase shares of Common Stock at $100 per share, which shares are
subject to restrictions on transfer that lapse at such times and circumstances
as specified when granted. Through March 31, 1998, a total of 112,940 shares of
restricted stock including 58,700 and 54,240 shares issued with a weighted
average fair value of $2378 and $2325 per share in fiscal years 1997 and 1996,
respectively have been issued under Plan. During fiscal year 1998,
performance-based awards represented by initial notional grants totaling 32,510
rights with a weighted average fair value of $3653 per right to purchase
restricted shares of Common Stock were granted to certain officers and key
employees under the Plan. Under the provisions of the performance-based awards,
no shares are issued at the time of the initial award and the number of shares
which will ultimately be issued shall be determined based on the change in the
market value of JRM Common Stock over a specified performance period.
A total of 92,500 shares of Common Stock are available for grants of options,
and rights to purchase restricted shares, to non-employee directors under JRM
Nonemployee Director Stock Plan at March 31, 1998. Options to purchase 600,
200, and 200 shares will be granted on the first, second, and third years,
respectively, of a Director term at not less than 100% of the 
45
fair market value on the date of grant, are fully vested and exercisable on the
date of grant and expire ten years after the date of the grant. Rights to
purchase 300, 100 and 100 shares are granted on the first, second and third
years, respectively, of a Director term, at $100 per share, which shares are
subject to restrictions on transfer that lapse at the end of such term. Through
March 31, 1998, a total of 3,100 shares of restricted stock have been issued
under the Nonemployee Director Stock Plan.
Under JRM 1995 Senior Management Stock Option Plan, senior management
employees may be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock. The total
number of shares available for grant is determined by the Board of Directors
from time to time. Options to purchase shares are granted at not less than 100%
of the fair market value on the date of grant, become exercisable at such time
or times as determined when granted, and expire not more than ten years after
the date of grant.
In the event of a change in control of JRM, all three programs have provisions
that may cause restrictions to lapse and accelerate the exercisability of
options outstanding.

As discussed in Note 1, JRM applies APB 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation. Charges to income related to stock
plan awards totaled approximately $1,541,000, $965,000 and $154,000 for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. If JRM had
accounted for its stock plan awards using the alternative fair value method of
accounting under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, its
net income loss and earnings loss per share would have been the pro forma
amounts indicated below                   1998     1997     1996

SFAS No. 123 does not apply to awards prior to fiscal year 1996 and additional
awards in future years are anticipated. The fair value of each option grant was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions:
1998     1997    1996

Thrift Plan
Certain employees of JRM participate in the Thrift Plan for Employees of
McDermott Incorporated and Participating Subsidiary and Affiliated Companies
the Thrift Plan, which is a defined contribution plan maintained by a
subsidiary of McDermott International. On June 5, 1995, a maximum of 5,000,000
of the authorized and unissued shares of JRM Common Stock was reserved for
possible issuance as the JRM employer match for employee contributions to the
Thrift Plan. Such employer contributions equal 50% of the first 6% of
compensation, as defined in the Thrift Plan, contributed by participants, and
fully vest and are non-forfeitable after five years of service or upon
retirement, death, lay-off or approved disability. During fiscal years 1998,
1997 and 1996, 65,727, 77,112 and 80,356 shares, respectively, were issued as
employer contributions pursuant to the Thrift Plan. At March 31, 1998,
4,776,805 shares remained available for issuance.
NOTE 11 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Investigations and Litigation - In March 1997, JRM and International, with the
help of outside counsel, began an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing
by a limited number of former employees of JRM and International and others.
The allegations concerned the heavy-lift business of the HeereMac joint
venture. Upon becoming aware of these allegations, JRM and International
notified authorities, including the Antitrust Division of the U. S. Department
of Justice and the European Commission. As a result of JRM and
International prompt disclosure of the allegations, both companies and the
individuals who were officers, directors and employees of JRM or International
at the time of the disclosure were granted immunity from criminal prosecution by
the Department of Justice for any anti-competitive acts involving worldwide
heavy-lift activities.
On December 21, 1997, following JRM termination of its joint venture with
Heerema Offshore Construction Group, Inc. Heerema, HeereMac and a HeereMac
employee pled guilty to criminal charges by the Department of Justice that they
and others had participated in a conspiracy to rig bids in connection with the
heavy-lift business of HeereMac in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Far East.
HeereMac was fined $49,000,000 and the employee $100,000. As part of the plea,
both HeereMac and certain employees of HeereMac agreed to cooperate fully with
the Department of Justice investigation. Neither JRM, International nor any of
their officers, directors or employees was a party to those proceedings.
JRM and International have cooperated and are continuing to cooperate with the
Department of Justice in its investigation. Near the end of calendar 1997, the
Department of Justice requested additional information from the companies
relating to possible anti-competitive activity in the marine construction
business of McDermott-ETPM East, Inc., one of the operating companies within
JRM former McDermott-ETPM joint venture with ETPM S.A., a French company.
Pursuant to the termination of the McDermott-ETPM joint venture on April 3,
1998, JRM assumed 100% ownership of McDermott-ETPM East, Inc., which has been
renamed J. Ray McDermott Middle East, Inc.
JRM and International are also cooperating with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC, which also requested information and documents from the
companies with respect to certain of the foregoing matters. JRM and
International are subject to a judicial order entered in 1976, with the consent
of McDermott Incorporated which at that time was the parent of the McDermott
group of companies, pursuant to an SEC complaint Consent Decree. The
Consent Decree prohibits the companies from making false entries in their books,
maintaining 
48
secret or unrecorded funds or using corporate funds for unlawful purposes.
Violations of the Consent Decree could result in substantial civil and/or
criminal penalties to the companies.
On June 1, 1998, Phillips Petroleum Company individually, and on behalf of
certain co-venturers and certain related entities filed a complaint in United
States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against JRM,
International, McDermott Incorporated, McDermott-ETPM, Inc., certain JRM
subsidiaries, HeereMac, Heerema, certain Heerema affiliates, and others. The
complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in anti-competitive acts in
violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and Sections 1505a and b
of the Texas Business and Commerce Code, engaged in fraudulent activity and
tortiously interfered with the plaintiffs' businesses in connection with certain
offshore transportation and installation projects in the Gulf of Mexico, North
Sea and Far East. In addition to seeking actual damages and attorneys' fees,
the plaintiffs have requested punitive as well as treble damages.
It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of the Department of Justice
investigation, the SEC inquiry, the companies' internal investigation, the above
referenced lawsuit, or the actions that may be taken by others as a result of
HeereMac guilty plea or otherwise. However, these matters could result in
civil and/or criminal liability and have a material adverse effect on JRM
consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In addition to the foregoing, JRM and certain of its officers, directors and
subsidiaries are defendants in numerous other legal proceedings. Management
believes that the outcome of these proceedings will not have a material adverse
effect upon JRM consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Operating Leases - Future minimum payments required under operating leases that
have initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms in excess of one year at
March 31, 1998 are as follows: 1999 - $5,565,000; 2000 - $4,575,000; 2001 3,753,000; 2002 - $1,855,000; 2003 - $1,827,000; and thereafter - $47,685,000.
Total rental expense for fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $74,262,000 67,990,000 and $66,617,000, respectively. These expense amounts include
contingent rentals and are net of sublease income, neither of which are
material.
Other - JRM maintains liability and property insurance against such risk and in
such amounts as it considers adequate. However, certain risks are either not
insurable or insurance is available only at rates which JRM considers
uneconomical.
Commitments for capital expenditures amounted to approximately $24,541,000 at
March 31, 1998, all of which relates to fiscal year 1999.
JRM is contingently liable under standby letters of credit totaling $235,736,000
including $47,086,000 issued on behalf of unconsolidated joint ventures at
March 31, 1998, all of which were issued in the normal course of business.
NOTE 12 - FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The principal customers of JRM are the offshore oil, natural gas and hydrocarbon
processing industries and other marine construction companies. These
concentrations of customers may impact JRM overall exposure to credit risk,
either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected
by changes in economic or other conditions. However, 
49
JRM management believes that the portfolio of receivables is well diversified
and that this diversification minimizes any potential credit risk. Receivables
are generally not collateralized.
JRM believes that its provision for possible losses on uncollectible accounts
receivable is adequate for its credit loss exposure. At March 31, 1998 and
1997, the allowance for possible losses deducted from Accounts receivable-trade
on the accompanying balance sheet was $2,164,000 and $3,634,000, respectively.

NOTE 14 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
JRM operates internationally giving rise to exposure to market risks from
changes in foreign exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments, primarily
forward exchange contracts, are utilized to reduce those risks. JRM does not
hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.
Forward exchange contracts are entered into primarily as hedges of certain firm
purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies. At March 31,
1998, JRM had forward exchange contracts to purchase $42,674,000 in foreign
currencies primarily Pound Sterling and Singapore Dollars, and to sell
$18,910,000 in foreign currencies primarily Singapore Dollars, at varying
maturities through fiscal year 1999. At March 31, 1997, JRM had forward exchange
contracts to purchase $66,969,000 in foreign currencies primarily Pound
Sterling, and to sell $257,000 in foreign currencies primarily Singapore
Dollars, at varying maturities through fiscal year 1998.
Deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses from hedging firm purchase and
sale commitments are included on a net basis in the balance sheet as a component
of either other current assets or accrued liabilities. They are recognized as
part of the purchase or sale transaction when it is recognized, or as other
gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur. At
March 31, 1998 and 1997, JRM had deferred gains of $586,000 and $2,127,000,
respectively, and deferred losses of $24,000 and $46,000, respectively, related
to forward exchange contracts which will primarily be recognized in accordance
with the percentage of completion method of accounting.
JRM is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but it does not anticipate
nonperformance by any of the counterparties. The amount of such exposure is
generally the unrealized gains in such contracts.
51
NOTE 15 - FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used by JRM in estimating its fair
value disclosures for financial instruments Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet
for cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values.
Investment securities: The fair values of investments are estimated based on
quoted market prices. For investments for which there are no quoted market
prices, fair values are derived from available yield curves for investments of
similar quality and terms. The carrying amounts for investments are their
estimated fair values see Note 13.
Note receivable from an unconsolidated affiliate: At March 31, 1997, it was not
practicable to estimate the fair value of JRM 775% Note Receivable from the
HeereMac joint venture because there were no quoted market prices and the time
of its settlement could not be determined.
Long and short-term debt: The fair values of debt instruments are based on
quoted market prices or, where quoted prices are not available, on the present
value of future cash flows discounted at estimated borrowing rates for similar
debt instruments or on estimated prices based on current yields for debt issues
of similar quality and terms. At March 31, 1998 and 1997, JRM had total debt
including notes payable to McDermott International and excluding capitalized
leases with carrying values of $268,194,000 and $386,816,000 and fair values of
$293,072,000 and $404,876,000, respectively.
Foreign currency exchange contracts: The fair values of foreign currency
forward exchange contracts are estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers. At
March 31, 1998 and 1997, JRM had net forward exchange contracts to purchase
foreign currencies with notional values of $23,764,000 and $66,712,000 and fair
values of $24,238,000 and $67,107,000, respectively.
NOTE 16 - SEGMENT REPORTING
JRM supplies worldwide services for the offshore oil and gas exploration and
production and hydrocarbon processing industries, and to other marine
construction companies. Principal activities include the design, engineering,
fabrication and installation of offshore drilling and production platforms,
specialized structures, modular facilities, marine pipelines and subsea
production systems. JRM also provides subsea trenching services, diving
services, procurement activities, and removal, salvage and refurbishment
services for offshore fixed platforms. These activities are managed and results
are evaluated primarily on a geographic area basis. Engineering Operations
which includes project management services and engineering services is primarily
managed and evaluated on a worldwide basis. Other is comprised of chartering
activity as well as consolidating adjustments which pertain to operations but
are excluded from management evaluation of segment performance.
Intersegment sales are accounted for at prices which are generally established
by reference to similar transactions with unaffiliated customers. Reportable
segments are measured based on operating income exclusive of general corporate
expenses. Other reconciling items to income 
52
loss before provision for income taxes are interest income, interest expense
and other-net. Corporate assets excluded from segment assets are primarily
investments in debt securities.
On May 7, 1998, JRM sold its interest in McDermott Engineering Europe Limited.
Management also intends to exit other European engineering operations. In
fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, these operations had revenues of $288,687,000 295,343,000 and $394,580,000, and operating income of $6,177,000, $9,739,000
and $4,524,000, respectively.
JRM does not believe it is dependent on any one customer. Sales to major
customers that exceeded 10% of revenues were: 1998--customer A $208,299,000
11%; 1997--customer A $235,590,000 17%, customer B $153,274,000 11%; and
1996--customer A $190,000,000 15%, customer B $198,453,000 16%. Customer A
is a customer of both the North American Operations segment and the Europe
Operations segment. Customer B is a customer of the Europe Operations segment.
