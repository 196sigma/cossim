46 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders   of Brooks Automation, Inc.   We have completed integrated audits of Brooks Automation,
Inc.s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2006 and an audit of its 2004 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.   Consolidated
financial statements   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Brooks Automation, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at September30, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September30, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for share-based compensation in fiscal 2006.   Internal
control over financial reporting   Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2006 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September30, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made   
47 Table of Contents   only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   As described in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Helix
Technology Corporation Helix and Synetics
Solutions Inc. Synetics from its assessment of
internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2006 because those entities were acquired by
the Company in purchase business combinations during fiscal
2006. We have also excluded Helix and Synetics from our audit of
internal control over financial reporting. The total assets and
total revenues of the acquired businesses of Helix and Synetics
represent 18% and 30%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
September30, 2006.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Equity
investments in which we exercise significant influence but do
not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted
for using the equity method.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Significant estimates are associated with accounts
receivable, inventories, intangible assets, goodwill, deferred
income taxes and warranty obligations. Although the Company
regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could differ
from those estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the
period in which they become known.   Foreign
Currency Translation   Some transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are made
in currencies different from their functional currency. Foreign
currency gains losses on these transactions or balances are
recorded in Other income expense, net when
incurred. Net foreign currency transaction gains losses
included in income loss before income taxes and minority
interest totaled $05million, $04million and
$04million for the years ended September30, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. For
non-U.S.subsidiaries,
assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange
rates, and income statement items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period. The local currency for all
foreign subsidiaries is considered to be the functional currency
and, accordingly, translation adjustments are reported in
Accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign
currency translation adjustments are one of the components added
to the Companys net income loss in the calculation of
comprehensive net income loss.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less. At
September30, 2006 and 2005, cash equivalents were
$165million and $1113million, respectively. Cash
equivalents are held at fair value.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade
receivables and temporary and long-term cash investments in
treasury bills and commercial paper. The   
53 Table of Contents   BROOKS
AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Company restricts its investments to repurchase agreements with
major banks, U.S.government and corporate securities, and
mutual funds that invest in U.S.government securities,
which are subject to minimal credit and market risk. The
Companys customers are concentrated in the semiconductor
industry, and relatively few customers account for a significant
portion of the Companys revenues. The Companys top
twenty largest customers account for approximately 55% of
revenues. The Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of
its customers and believes that it has adequately provided for
exposure to potential credit losses.   Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is
the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable
credit losses in its existing accounts receivable. The Company
determines the allowance based on historical write-off
experience by customer. The Company reviews its allowance for
doubtful accounts quarterly. Past due balances over 90days
and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for
collectibility. All other balances are reviewed on a pooled
basis by type of receivable. Account balances are charged off
against the allowance when the Company feels it is probable the
receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any
off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.   Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined using the
first-in,
first-out method. The Company provides inventory reserves for
excess, obsolete or damaged inventory based on changes in
customer demand, technology and other economic factors.   Fixed
Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method. Depreciable lives are summarized below   	
Buildings
20- 40years   Computer equipment and software
2- 6years   Machinery and equipment
2-10years   Furniture and fixtures
3-10years   Leasehold improvements and equipment held under capital leases
are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives
or the term of the respective leases. Equipment used for
demonstrations to customers is included in machinery and
equipment and is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.   The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of
long-lived assets, including its intangible assets, whenever
events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. This periodic
review may result in an adjustment of estimated depreciable
lives or an asset impairment. When indicators of impairment are
present, the carrying values of the asset are evaluated in
relation to their operating performance and future undiscounted
cash flows of the underlying business. If the future
undiscounted cash flows are less than their book value, an
impairment exists. The impairment is measured as the difference
between the book value and the fair value of the underlying
asset. Fair values are based on estimates of market prices and
assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future
cash flows and assumed discount rates, reflecting varying
degrees of perceived risk.   When an asset is retired, the cost of the asset disposed of, and
the related accumulated depreciation, are removed from the
accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the
determination of operating profit loss.

Assets and Goodwill   Patents include capitalized direct costs associated with
obtaining patents as well as assets that were acquired as a part
of purchase business combinations. Capitalized patent costs are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated
economic life of the patents. As of September30, 2006 and
2005, the net book value of the Companys patents was
$31million and $02million, respectively.   Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the
businesses the Company acquired. The Company performs an annual
impairment test of its goodwill as required under the provisions
of FAS142 on September30 of each fiscal year unless
interim indicators of impairment exist see Note6.   The amortizable lives of intangible assets, including those
identified as a result of purchase accounting, are summarized as
follows   	
Patents
3-8years   Completed technology

5years   Trademarks and trade names
3-6years   Non-competition agreements
3-5years   Customer relationships
4-11years   Revenue
Recognition   Product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware
systems and components as well as software licenses. Service
revenues are associated with hardware-related field service,
training, software maintenance and software-related consulting
and integration services.   Revenue from product sales that do not include significant
customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of
loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an
arrangement, fees are fixed or determinable, collection of the
related receivable is reasonably assured and, if applicable,
customer acceptance criteria have been successfully
demonstrated. Customer acceptance provisions include final
testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment. These
pre-shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the
product meets the published specification requirements before
the product is shipped. In the limited situations where the
arrangement contains extended payment terms, revenue is
recognized as the payments become due. Shipping terms are
customarily FCA shipping point. Amounts charged to customers for
costs incurred for shipping and handling are credited to cost of
revenues where the associated costs are charged. When
significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present
in the arrangement, revenue is recognized upon completion of
customer acceptance testing.   Revenue from the sale of
off-the-shelf
software licenses is recognized upon delivery to the customer
provided there is evidence of an arrangement, fees are fixed or
determinable, collection of the related receivable is probable,
and there are no unusual acceptance criteria or extended payment
terms. If the arrangement contains acceptance criteria or
testing, then revenue is recognized upon acceptance or the
successful completion of the testing. If the arrangement
contains extended payment terms, revenue is recognized as the
payments become due. Revenue related to post-contract support is
deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.   For tailored software contracts, we provide significant
consulting services to tailor the software to the
customers environment. If we are able to reasonably
estimate the level of effort and related costs to complete the
contract, we recognize revenue using the
percentage-of-completion
method, which compares costs incurred to total estimated project
costs. Revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in
the period in which the facts that require such revisions become
known. If our ability to complete the tailored software is
uncertain or if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of
effort and related costs, completed contract accounting is
applied. Losses, if any, are provided for in the period in which
such losses are first identified by management. Generally, the
terms of long-term   
55 Table of Contents   BROOKS
AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   contracts provide for progress billing based on completion of
certain phases of work. For maintenance contracts, service
revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence
of its fair value and is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance contract. Deferred revenue primarily relates to
services and maintenance agreements and billings in excess of
revenue recognized on long term contracts accounted for using
the
percentage-of-completion
method and contracts awaiting final customer acceptance.   In transactions that include multiple products
and/or
services, such as tailored software arrangements, described
above, or software sales with post-contract support, we allocate
the sales value among each of the elements based on their
relative fair values and recognize such revenue when each
element is delivered. If these relative fair values are not
known, the Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue
from arrangements with one or more elements to be delivered at a
future date, when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered
elements exist. Under the residual method, the fair value of any
the undelivered elements at the date of delivery, such as
post-contract support, are deferred and the remaining portion of
the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. The Company
determines fair value of undelivered services based on the
prices that are charged when the same element is sold separately
to customers.   Warranty   The Company offers warranties on the sales of certain of its
products and records an accrual for estimated future claims.
Such accruals are based upon historical experience and
managements estimate of the level of future claims.   Research
and Development Expenses   Research and development costs are charged to expense when
incurred, except for certain software development costs.
Software development costs are expensed prior to establishing
technological feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the
product is available for general release to customers.
Capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of
sales on a
product-by-product
basis over the estimated lives of the related products,
typically three years. The Company did not capitalize any such
costs during fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.   Stock-Based
Compensation   Effect of
Adoption of SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment   Prior to October1, 2005, the Companys employee stock
compensation plans were accounted for in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB25 and related interpretations. Under
this method, no compensation expense was recognized as long as
the exercise price equaled or exceeded the market price of the
underlying stock on the measurement date of the grant. The
Company elected the disclosure-only alternative permitted under
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123, as amended by
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
SFAS148, for fixed stock-based awards to employees.   On December23, 2004, the Company accelerated the vesting
of certain unvested stock options awarded to employees, officers
and other eligible participants under the Companys various
stock option plans, other than its 1993 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan. As such, the Company fully vested options to
purchase 1,229,239shares of the Companys common
stock with exercise prices greater than or equal to
$2400per share. The acceleration of the vesting of these
options resulted in a charge based on generally accepted
accounting principles of approximately $10million. The
Company took this action because it produced a more favorable
impact on the Companys results from operations in light of
the effective date of SFAS123R, which took place in the
Companys first fiscal quarter of 2006.   As of October1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS123R
using the modified prospective method, which requires
measurement of compensation cost for all stock awards at fair
value on date of grant and recognition of

STATEMENTSContinued   compensation over the service period for awards expected to
vest. The fair value of restricted stock is determined based on
the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price
of the Companys common stock over the exercise price of
the restricted stock, and the fair value of stock options is
determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which is
consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for
options in footnote disclosures required under SFAS123, as
amended by SFAS148. Such value is recognized as expense
over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The
estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires
significant judgment. We consider many factors when estimating
expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class,
and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes in
estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates.

Incentive Plans   The Companys equity incentive plans are intended to
attract and retain employees and to provide an incentive for
them to assist the Company to achieve long-range performance
goals and to enable them to participate in the long-term growth
of the Company. The equity incentive plans consist of plans
under which employees may be granted options to purchase shares
of the Companys stock, restricted stock and other equity
incentives. Stock options generally have a vesting period of
4years and are exercisable for a period not to exceed
7years from the date of issuance. Restricted stock awards
generally vest over one to four years. At September30,
2006, a total of 5,972,077shares were reserved and
available for the issuance of stock and restricted stock, which
reflects an increase of 3,000,000shares approved by the
shareholders in March 2006.   Income
Taxes   The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability
method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax
bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The
Companys consolidated financial statements contain certain
deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of
operating losses, as well as other temporary differences between
financial and tax accounting. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No109 Accounting for Income Taxes,
requires the Company to establish a valuation allowance if the
likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets is reduced
based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence.
Significant management judgment is required in determining the
Companys provision for income taxes, the Companys
deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance
recorded against those net deferred tax assets. The Company
evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the net deferred income tax assets will not be realized.   Earnings
Loss Per Share   Basic earnings loss per share is calculated based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings loss per share is calculated based on
the weighted average number

outstanding during the period. Shares used to compute diluted
earnings loss per share exclude common share equivalents if
their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and
cash equivalents, investments in long- and short-term debt
securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets
approximate their fair value at September30, 2006 and
2005. The Companys financial instruments at
September30, 2005 also included its convertible notes,
which were paid in full in July 2006. At September30,
2005, the estimated fair value of the Companys convertible
notes was approximately $1693million compared to the
carrying value of $1750million. The estimated fair value
of the convertible notes is based on the quoted market price of
the convertible notes on September30, 2005.   Reclassifications   Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2005 and 2004
Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the 2006
presentation.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No154, Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion
No20, Accounting Changes and FASB Statement No3,
Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements SFAS154. SFAS154
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of
accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless
impracticable, retrospective application as the required method
for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of
explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted
accounting principle. SFAS154 also provides guidance for
determining whether retrospective application of a change in
accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change
when retrospective application is impracticable. The provisions
of this Statement are effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal periods beginning after
December15, 2005.   In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FINNo48. FINNo48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprises financial statements in
accordance with FASNo109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. FINNo48 prescribes a two-step
process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized.
First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the
likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination.
If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not
to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine
the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.
The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest
amount that has a greater than 50percent likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance will
become effective as of the beginning of the Companys
fiscal year beginning after December15, 2006. The Company
is currently evaluating the potential impact of
FINNo48 on its financial position and results of
operations.   In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements
SAB108 expressing the Staffs views
regarding the process of quantifying financial statement
misstatements. There have been two widely-recognized methods for
quantifying the effects of financial statement errors: the
roll-over method and the iron curtain
method. The roll-over method focuses primarily on the impact of
a misstatement on the income statement, including the reversing
effect of prior year misstatements, but its use can lead to the
accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. The
iron-curtain method, on the other hand, focuses primarily on the
effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less
emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the
income statement.   
59 Table of Contents   BROOKS
AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   SAB108 establishes an approach that requires
quantification of financial statement errors based on the
effects of the error on each of the Companys financial
statements and the related financial statement disclosures. This
model is commonly referred to as a dual approach
because it essentially requires quantification of errors under
both the iron-curtain and the roll-over methods. The provisions
of SAB108 should be applied to annual financial statements
covering the first fiscal year ending after November15,
2006. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of
SAB108.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS157.
SFAS157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles
GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS157 applies under other accounting
pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements,
the FASB having previously concluded in those accounting
pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement
attribute. Accordingly, SFAS157 does not require any new
fair value measurements. SFAS157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, with earlier adoption
permitted. The provisions of SFAS157 should be applied
prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it
is initially applied, with limited exceptions. The Company is
currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS157.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo158,
Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88, 106, and 132R
SFAS158. SFAS158 requires an employer
that is a business entity and sponsors one or more
single-employer defined benefit plans to   a.Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan, measured
as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the
benefit obligation, in its statement of financial position. For
a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit
obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a
retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.   b.Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income,
net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or
credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as
components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to
SFASNo87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, or SFASNo106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions. Amounts recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income, including the gains or
losses, prior service costs or credits, and the transition asset
or obligation remaining from the initial application of
SFASNo87 and SFASNo106, are adjusted
as they are subsequently recognized as components of net
periodic benefit cost pursuant to the recognition and
amortization provisions of those Statements.   c.Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as
of the date of the employers fiscal year-end statement of
financial position with limited exceptions.   d.Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional
information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost
for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of
the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and
transition asset or obligation.   An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required
to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as
of the end of the fiscal year ending after December15,
2006. Retrospective application is not permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS158.

Acquisitions   Helix
Technology Corporation   On October26, 2005, the Company acquired all the issued
and outstanding stock of Helix Technology Corporation
Helix. Helix develops and manufactures vacuum
technology solutions for the semiconductor, data storage, and
flat panel display markets. The Company believes that the
acquisition of Helix enables it to better serve its current
market, increase its addressable market, reduce the volatility
that both businesses have historically faced and positions the
Company to enhance its financial performance. The aggregate
purchase price, net of cash acquired, was approximately
$4581million, consisting of 290million shares of
common stock valued at $4446million, the fair value of
assumed Helix options of $33million and transaction costs
of $102million. The market price used to value the
Brooks shares issued as consideration for Helix was
$1532, which represents the average of the closing market price
of Brooks common stock for the period beginning two trading days
before and ending two trading days after the merger agreement
was announced. The actual number of shares of Brooks common
stock issued was determined based on the actual number of shares
of Helix common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
completion of the merger, based on an exchange ratio of
111shares of Brooks common stock for each outstanding
share of Helix common stock. The Helix business operates in the
Companys hardware segment. This transaction qualified as a

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets   The Company performs an annual impairment test of its goodwill
as required under the provisions of FAS142 on
September30 of each fiscal year unless interim indicators
of impairment exist. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when
the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated
fair value. Fair values are estimated using a discounted cash
flow methodology. Discounted cash flows are based on the
businesses strategic plans and managements best
estimate of revenue growth and gross profit by each reporting
unit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the
Companys equipment automation and factory automation
segments were combined into the hardware segment, which reflects
how management now evaluates its business see Note16.   In fiscal 2004, in connection with a third party letter of
intent to purchase the assets of the SELS, which made up the
Companys Other segment, the Company assessed
the potential impairment of goodwill for this segment See
Note20. The Company considered the offer in the letter of
intent as an indication of fair value. Based on its analysis,
the Company determined that the implied fair value of the then

there were no interim indicators of potential impairment of
goodwill in the Companys other segments, the Company
performed its annual impairment test under FAS142 in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 using the present value of
expected cash flows. The Companys analysis indicated no
impairment of the goodwill in these segments.   In fiscal 2005 and 2006, the Company performed its annual

The joint venture was formed in 1981 by Helix and ULVAC
Corporation. UCI manufactures and sells cryogenic vacuum pumps,
principally to ULVAC Corporation, one of the largest
semiconductor and flat panel OEMs in Japan. Each company
owns 50% of UCI. The joint venture arrangement includes a
license and technology agreement exclusively involving
technology previously owned by Helix.   The Company owns 50% of the outstanding common stock of UCI.
This investment is accounted for using the equity method. Under
this method of accounting, the Company records in income its
proportionate share of the earnings of UCI with a corresponding
increase in the carrying value of the investment.

As a result of recognizing substantial operating losses in prior
years, including the year ended September30, 2005, and the
continuing uncertainty in the semiconductor sector, the Company
has determined that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will not be realized and has maintained a
full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets
from continuing operations at September30, 2006 and 2005.
The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is
subject to change based on future events, including generating
taxable income in future periods. The Company continues to
assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance
sheet date based on all available evidence. However, it is
possible that the more likely than not criterion
could be met in fiscal 2007 or a future period, which could
result in the reversal of a significant portion or all of the
valuation allowance, which, at that time, would be recorded as a
tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations.   The approximate $404million decrease in the valuation
allowance at September30, 2006 compared to
September30, 2005 is principally due to the recording of
deferred tax liabilities due to acquired identified intangibles,
utilization of net operating losses, expiring tax credits and
changes in state and foreign tax rates.   As of September30, 2006, the Company had federal, state
and foreign net operating loss carryforwards from continuing and
discontinued operations of approximately $7216million and
federal and state research and development tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $147million available to
reduce future tax liabilities, which expire at various dates
through 2026. Included in the net operating loss carryforwards
are stock option deductions of approximately $195million.
The benefits of these tax deductions approximate
$70million of which approximately $40million will
be credited to additional paid-in capital upon being realized or
recognized.   We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining the world-wide
provision for income taxes. While it is often difficult to
predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any
particular tax matter, we believe that the tax reserves reflect
the probable outcome of known contingencies. Tax reserves
established include, but are not limited to, business
combinations, transfer pricing, withholding taxes, and various
state and foreign audit matters, some of which may be resolved
in the near future resulting in an adjustment to the reserve.

All employees of the Company or any affiliate of the Company,
independent directors, consultants and advisors are eligible to
participate in the 2000 Plan. Options under the 2000 Plan
generally vest over four years and expire seven years from the
date of grant. At the Companys March 2006 Annual Meeting,
stockholders approved an amendment to the 2000 Plan to increase
the number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan by
3,000,000shares, for a total of 9,000,000shares. As
of September30, 2006, options to purchase
2,436,029shares are outstanding and 5,527,450shares
remain available for grant.   During the year ended September30, 2006, the Company
issued 699,500shares of restricted stock or units under
the Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, net of
cancellations. These restricted stock awards generally have the
following vesting schedules: three year vesting in which 25%
vest in Year1, 25% vest in Year 2 and 50% vest in Year 3;
four year vesting in which 50% vest in Year2, 25% vest in
Year 3 and 25% vest in Year 4: and four year cliff vesting.
Compensation expense related to these awards is being recognized
on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the
difference between the fair market value of the Companys
common stock on the date of grant and the amount received from
the employee.   1998

Acquisition-Related
and Restructuring Costs and Accruals   Fiscal
2006 Activities   The Company recorded a charge to continuing operations of
$53million in the year ended September30, 2006 for
restructuring costs.   Restructuring
Costs   Based on estimates of its near term future revenues and
operating costs, in fiscal 2006, the Company took additional
cost reduction actions. Accordingly, charges of
$53million were recorded for these actions. Of this
amount, $33million related to workforce reductions and
$20million related to excess facilities primarily related
to a vacant facility in Billerica, Massachusetts due to a longer
period than initially estimated to sublease the facility. The
workforce reductions consisted of $24million of severance
costs associated with the termination of approximately 40 legacy
Brooks employees worldwide in sales, service, operations and
administrative functions, whose positions were made redundant as
a result of the Helix acquisition and further downsizing in the
Companys software segment, and $18million for
retention bonuses earned in the period by employees who have
been notified of their termination in the current and prior
periods, offset by the $09million reversal of previously
accrued termination costs to employees who will no longer be
terminated or whose termination was settled at a reduced cost.
The accruals for workforce reductions are expected to be paid
over the next twelve months. The impact of these cost reductions
on the Companys liquidity is not expected to be
significant, as these cost savings yield actual cash savings
within twelve months.   The Company continues to review and align its cost structure to
attain profitable operations amid the changing semiconductor
cycles.   Fiscal
2005 Activities   The Company recorded a charge to continuing operations of
$165million in the year ended September30, 2005 for
restructuring costs. The Company also recorded a charge of
$10million in the year ended September30, 2005
related to the discontinued SELS division, which is included in
the loss from discontinued operations.   Restructuring
Costs   Based on estimates of its near term future revenues and
operating costs, the Company announced in fiscal 2005 plans to
take additional cost reduction actions. Accordingly, charges of
$175million, of which $10million related to, and
is classified within discontinued operations, were recorded for
these actions. Of this amount, $143million related to
workforce reductions of approximately 270 employees world wide,
across all functions of the business and $32million
related to excess facilities. Of the $32million of
facilities charges, $15million represents an additional
accrual on a previous vacated facility due to a longer period
than initially estimated to
sub-lease
the facility. Workforce reduction charges included
$43million for headcount reduction of approximately 100
individuals associated with our software segment,
$36million for reductions of approximately 65 employees
in our Jena, Germany facility and $64million related to
various other actions undertaken in fiscal 2005. Excess facility
charges consist of the present value of remaining lease
obligations on facilities vacated in fiscal 2005. The impact of
these cost reductions on the Companys liquidity is not
expected to be significant, as these actions yield equivalent
actual cash savings within twelve months.   Fiscal
2004 Activities   The Company recorded a charge to operations of $54million
in the year ended September30, 2004 of which
$01million related to acquisitions and $53million
related to restructuring costs.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Acquisition-Related
Costs   The $01million related to acquisitions is comprised of
legal and consulting costs to integrate and consolidate acquired
entities into existing Brooks entities.   Restructuring
Costs   Based on estimates of its near term future revenues and
operating costs, the Company announced in fiscal 2004 several
plans to take additional cost reduction actions. Accordingly,
charges of $53million were recorded for these actions. Of
this amount, $39million related to workforce reductions
of approximately 60 employees world wide, across all functions
of the business and $14million related to excess
facilities. Excess facilities charges of $14million
consisted of $02million for excess facilities identified
in fiscal 2004 that were recorded to recognize the amount of the
remaining lease obligations. These costs have been estimated
from the time when the space is vacant and there are no plans to
utilize the facility. Costs incurred prior to vacating the
facilities were charged to operations. Final exit costs for
facilities abandoned in previous restructurings amounted to
$07million. The remaining $05million represents a
reevaluation of the assumptions used in determining the fair
value of certain lease obligations related to facilities
abandoned in a previous restructuring. The revised assumptions,
including lower estimates of expected
sub-rental
income over the remainder of the lease terms, are based on
managements evaluation of the rental space available. The
Company believes that the cost reduction programs implemented
will align costs with revenues. In the event the Company is
unable to achieve this alignment, additional cost cutting
programs may be required in the future. The facilities charges
are expected to be paid over the remaining lease periods,
expiring in fiscal 2011. These charges helped better align the
Companys cost structure. The impact of these cost
reductions on the Companys liquidity is not expected to be
significant, as these actions yield equivalent actual cash
savings within twelve months.   The activity related to the Companys restructuring
accruals is below, which includes activity related to our

Segment
and Geographic Information   The Company has two reportable segments: hardware and software.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Companys
equipment automation and factory automation segments were
combined into the hardware segment, which reflects how
management now evaluates its business.   The hardware segment provides wafer handling products and
components for use within semiconductor process equipment. These
systems automate the movement of wafers into and out of
semiconductor manufacturing process chambers and provide an
integration point between factory automation systems and process
tools. The products offered by the Company include vacuum and
atmospheric systems and robots, subsystems, and related
components. Also offered are assembly and manufacturing of
customer designed automation systems, or contract automation
systems. The primary customers for these solutions are
manufacturers of process tool equipment. Other hardware products
include Brooks automated material handling systems, or
AMHS, and equipment for lithography automation that manage the
storage, inspection and transport of photomasks, or reticles.   The software segment addresses the need for production
management systems driven by the extensive tracking and tracing
requirements of the semiconductor industry. At the core of these
production systems is the manufacturing execution system
MES that is primarily responsible for tracking the
movement of production wafers in a fab, and managing the data
and actions for every wafer, equipment, operator and other
resources in the fab. These mission-critical systems provide
real time information primarily to production operators,
supervisors and fab managers. Also provided is other important
software applications to meet the critical requirements of the
fab, such as real time dispatching and scheduling, equipment
communications, advanced process control, material control using
the AMHS, activity execution and control, automated maintenance
management of equipment, and other applications. Customers often
purchase more than one of these software products from Brooks
for a single fab, often driving the need for consulting and
integration services. These software products enable
semiconductor manufacturers to increase their return on
investment by maximizing production efficiency, and may be sold
as part of an integrated solution or on a stand-alone basis.
These software products and services are also used in many
similar manufacturing industries as semiconductor, including
flat panel display, data storage, and electronic assembly.   The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based
on revenues and operating income loss. Operating income loss
for each segment includes selling, general and administrative
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Amortization of
acquired intangible assets, including impairment of these assets
and of goodwill and acquisition-related and restructuring
charges are excluded from the segments operating income
loss. The Companys non-allocable overhead costs, which
include corporate general and administrative expenses, are
allocated between the segments based upon segment revenues.
Segment assets exclude deferred tax assets, acquired intangible
assets, goodwill, marketable securities and cash equivalents.   79 Table of Contents   BROOKS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Contingencies   There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights in the semiconductor and related
industries. The Company has in the past been, and may in the
future be, notified that it may be infringing intellectual
property rights possessed by other third parties. The Company
cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or
other claims for indemnification by customers or end users of
its products resulting from infringement claims will not be
asserted in the future or that such assertions, if proven to be
true, will not materially and adversely affect the
Companys business, financial condition and results
of operations. If any such claims are asserted against the
Companys intellectual property rights, the Company may
seek to enter into a royalty or licensing arrangement. The
Company cannot guarantee, however, that a license will be
available on reasonable terms or at all. The Company could
decide in the alternative to resort to litigation to challenge
such claims or to attempt to design around the patented
technology. Litigation or an attempted design around could be
costly and would divert the Companys managements
attention and resources. In addition, if the Company does not
prevail in such litigation or succeed in an attempted design
around, the Company could be forced to pay significant damages
or amounts in settlement. Even if a design around is effective,
the functional value of the product in question could be greatly
diminished.   ITI
Lawsuit   On or about April21, 2005, the Company was served with a
third-party complaint seeking to join the Company as a party to
a patent lawsuit brought by an entity named Information
Technology Innovation, LLC based in Northbrook, Illinois
ITI against Motorola, Inc. Motorola
and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. Freescale. In
the lawsuit the ITI Lawsuit, ITI claimed that
Motorola and Freescale had infringed a U.S.patent that ITI
asserts covers processes used to model a semiconductor
manufacturing plant. ITI asserted that the Company has induced
and contributed to the infringement of the patent. Subsequently
Intel Corporation Intel filed a lawsuit against
ITI seeking a declaratory judgment that Intel has not infringed
and is not infringing the patent the Intel Lawsuit
and notified the Company that Intel believed that the Company
had an indemnification obligation to Intel, but that, at that
time, Intel was not seeking to have those obligations determined
and enforced in the Intel Lawsuit.   Freescale alleged that the Company had a duty to indemnify
Freescale and Motorola from any infringement claims asserted
against them based on their use of our AutoSched software
program by paying all costs and expenses and all or part of any
damages that either of them might incur as a result of the ITI
Lawsuit brought by ITI.   Pursuant to an agreement executed on April28, 2006, the
Company settled and concluded with ITI and the other parties all
of the matters that were or might have been raised in this
litigation. In exchange for a cash payment, the settlement
affords a license, releases and covenants from ITI not to sue
the Company, the other parties named above, and all users of
certain of our factory modeling software products such as the
Autosched product. The Intel Lawsuit was also
dismissed as a result of this settlement. In addition, the
Company settled the claim for indemnification brought against
Brooks by Freescale by the payment to Freescale of $400,000 to
defray a portion of the legal expenses borne by Freescale in the
defense of the ITI litigation.   Other
Commercial Litigation Matters   In January 2006 a ruling was issued against the Company by a
Massachusetts state court in a commercial litigation matter
involving the Company and BlueShift Technologies, Inc. Awards of
damages and costs were assessed against Brooks in January and
April 2006 in the amount of approximately $16million,
which had been accrued for at December31, 2005. Brooks has
filed a notice of appeal in the case with the Massachusetts
Appeals Court and that appeal is now pending.

Relating to Equity Incentive Practices and the
Restatement   On May12, 2006, we announced that the Company had received
notice that the Boston Office of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission the SEC was conducting an
informal inquiry concerning stock option grant practices to
determine whether violations of the securities laws had
occurred. On June2, 2006, the SEC issued a voluntary
request for information to us in connection with an informal
inquiry by that office regarding a loan we previously reported
had been made to former Chairman and CEO Robert Therrien in
connection with the exercise by him of stock options in 1999. On
June23, 2006, we were informed that the SEC had opened a
formal investigation into this matter and on the general topic
of the timing of stock option grants. On June28, 2006, the
SEC issued subpoenas to the Company and to the Special
Committee, which had previously been formed on March8,
2006, requesting documents related to the Companys stock
option grant practices and to the loan to Mr.Therrien.   On May19, 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the
United States Attorney the DOJ for the Eastern
District of New York requesting documents relating to stock
option grants. Responsibility for the DOJs investigation
was subsequently assumed by the United States Attorney for the
District of Massachusetts. On June22, 2006 the United
States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts
issued a grand jury subpoena to us in connection with an
investigation by that office into the timing of stock option
grants by us and the loan to Mr.Therrien mentioned above.   The Company is cooperating fully with the investigations being
conducted by the SEC and the DOJ.   Private

committed to a formal plan of disposal of its software division,
Brooks Software and entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement
the Purchase Agreement with Applied Materials,
Inc. Applied, a Delaware corporation. Under the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company will divest and
sell its software division, Brooks Software, to Applied for
$125million in cash consideration. The Company will
transfer to Applied substantially all of its assets primarily
related to Brooks Software, including the stock of several
subsidiaries engaged only in the business of Brooks Software,
and Applied will assume certain liabilities related to Brooks
Software. The Company is selling its software division in order
to focus on its core semiconductor-related hardware businesses.
The Company expects to recognize a gain on disposal of the
software division and to reclassify this division as
discontinued operations in fiscal 2007.   Completion of the transaction is subject to several conditions,
including expiration or termination of applicable waiting
periods under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino
AntitrustImprovements Act of 1976 and clearance under any
applicable foreign antitrust laws, and other customary closing
conditions. The Company expects to close the transaction during

and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of our

financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under
Rule13a-15e
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our
chief executive officer and our chief financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report.   Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a
process designed by, or under the supervision of our chief
executive and chief financial officers and effected by our board
of directors, management and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition
of our assets   
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in
accordance with authorization of our management and
directors;and   
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2006. In making this assessment, we
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO an Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.Based on our
assessment, we concluded that, as of September30, 2006,
our internal control over financial reporting was effective.   Management has excluded the operations of Helix Technology
Corporation Helix and Synetics Solutions Inc.
Synetics from its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting as of September30, 2006 because
those entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business
combinations during fiscal 2006. The total assets and total
revenues of the acquired businesses of Helix and Synetics
represent 18% and 30%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
September30, 2006.   
89 Table of Contents   Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
September30, 2006, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in
Item8 of this report.   Changes
