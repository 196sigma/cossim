Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, that ensure that information relating to the Company which is required to be disclosed in this Annual Report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within required time periods. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective to ensure that material information
relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be accumulated and communicated to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this Annual Report was being prepared, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There has not occurred any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Slade GortonOf Counsel at Preston Gates Ellis LLP; former U.S. Senator, Washington  Marc J. OppenheimerPresident of Octagon Associates, Inc.  As a result of certain of the transactions consummated in fiscal 2006 and the first quarter
of fiscal 2007, all of our key operating subsidiaries are now wholly owned by IDT and none of such companies have securities that are separately listed on any exchange. Accordingly, we have removed non-employee directors from the Boards of Directors
of each of Net2Phone, IDT Telecom, IDT Capital and IDT Spectrum.  Additionally,
the Nominating Committee of our Board of Directors has determined to nominate a smaller slate of directors for election at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on December 14, 2006. Our smaller Board of Directors will continue to consist of
a majority of Independent Directors, as defined by the New York Stock Exchange.  The decreases in board sizes and the elimination of non-employee members on subsidiary boards reduces our costs which is consistent with the company-wide cost cutting measures put into place in fiscal 2006.  The remaining information required by this Item will be contained in the Companys Proxy
Statement for its Annual Stockholders Meeting, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days after July31, 2006, and which is incorporated by reference herein.  We make available free of charge through the investor relations page of our Web site

beneficial owners of more than 10% of our equity, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have adopted codes of business conduct and ethics for all of our
employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. Copies of the codes of business conduct and ethics are available on our web site.  Our web site and the information contained therein or incorporated therein are not intended
