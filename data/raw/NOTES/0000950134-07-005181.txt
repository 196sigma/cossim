Description
of Business   Volterra Semiconductor Corporation the Company or
Volterra was incorporated in Delaware in 1996, and
its principal offices are located in Fremont, California. The
Company designs, develops, and markets proprietary,
high-performance analog and mixed-signal power management
semiconductors for the computing, storage, networking, and
consumer markets.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   aPrinciples
of Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency of foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S.dollar and foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are recorded in income. For all
periods presented, there have been no material foreign currency
transaction gains and losses.   bUse
of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.   cFinancial
Instruments and Concentrations of Credit Risk   Financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The
carrying value of the Companys financial instruments
approximates the respective fair value due to the relatively
short maturities of these instruments. Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of investments and trade accounts
receivable.   The Company maintains cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments with high credit quality financial institutions.
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments maturing
in 90days or less from the date of purchase. Short-term
investments are comprised of U.S.Treasury and government
agency debt securities with remaining contractual maturities on
the date of purchase greater than 90days but less than one
year. Investments in debt securities are classified as
held-to-maturity
and carried at amortized cost. The following table reconciles
the amortized cost to the fair value of investments   	
As of December31   2006   2005   Amortized cost
9,977     14,952   Unrealized gains
4     Unrealized losses

9,979     14,919   All investments in debt securities were included in short-term
investments at December31, 2006 and 2005.   The Company sells its products to international distributors and
original equipment manufacturers and their outsourced
suppliers in the computing, storage, networking, and consumer
electronic industries. The Company performs continuing credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition and
generally does not require collateral from its customers. An
allowance is provided for when it is probable and estimable that
accounts receivable will not be collected.

Reporting and Significant Customers   The Company is organized and operates as a single business
segment: analog and mixed-signal power management
semiconductors. The Companys chief operating decision
maker, the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial
information presented on a consolidated basis for the purposes
of making operating decisions and assessing financial
performance.   Significant customers are those customers accounting for more
than 10% of the Companys total net revenue or accounts
receivable. For each significant customer, net revenue as a
percentage of total net revenue and accounts receivable as a
percentage of total accounts receivable are as follows

6     8     5     The geographic area to which a product was shipped is not
necessarily the same location in which the product is ultimately
used. In all periods, substantially all of the Companys
net revenue was denominated in U.S.dollars.   eInventory   Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which
approximates actual cost on a
first-in,
first-out basis or market. Provisions, when required, are made
to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net
realizable values.   fProperty
and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which are three years for computer hardware and
software, and five to seven years for equipment and furniture.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
lease term or the estimated useful life of seven years. The
Companys long-lived assets are primarily located in the
United States.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   gRevenue
Recognition   Revenue from the sale of semiconductor products is recognized
upon shipment when title transfers to the customer provided that
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed
or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is
reasonably assured. An allowance is recorded at the time of sale
to provide for estimated future returns and allowances. The
allowance is based upon historical experience, current trends,
and the Companys expectations regarding future experience.
Sales returns must be authorized by Volterra and are generally
limited to instances of potential product failure under the
Companys standard warranty that provides that products
will be free from defects for a period of one year from shipment.   The Company has made no sales to U.S.distributors.
Volterras sales to international distributors are made
under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after
purchase and provide limited return rights under the
Companys standard warranty. Revenue on these sales is
recognized upon shipment when title passes to the distributor.
Volterra estimates future international distributor sales
returns and allowances based on historical data and current
business expectations and reduces revenue for estimated future
returns and allowances through the allowance for sales returns.   hEarnings
Per Share   Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income
by the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by
dividing the net income by the weighted average shares
outstanding of common stock and dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares
consist of dilutive shares issuable upon the exercise of
outstanding stock options and warrants, computed using the
treasury stock method, and conversion of convertible preferred
stock.   The following table sets forth for all periods presented the
computation of basic and diluted net income per share, including
the reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the
calculation

per share in the future.

SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   iIncome
Taxes   Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is established if it is
more likely than not that a portion of deferred tax assets will
not be realized.   jStock-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No123R, Share-Based Payment. Under
SFASNo123R stock-based compensation cost is
measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award
that is ultimately expected to vest, and is recognized as an
expense over the requisite service period. The Company
previously applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,
and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma
disclosures of SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. The Company recorded employee
stock-based compensation for options granted to employees with
an exercise price less than the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. Upon the adoption of
SFASNo123R, the Company changed its method of
attributing the value of stock-based compensation to expense
from the accelerated approach prescribed by Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Interpretation FIN No28,
Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable
Stock Options or Award Plans, to the straight-line method.
Compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted
prior to January1, 2006 will continue to be recognized
using the accelerated approach.   SFASNo123R was adopted using the modified
prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective
method, prior periods are not restated for the effect of
SFASNo123R. Stock-based compensation expense
recognized in the Companys Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended December31, 2006 included
all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as
of January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, and compensation for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006, based on
the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo123R. In addition, deferred
stock-based compensation of $189 as of December31, 2005,
which was accounted for under APB No25, was reclassified
into additional
paid-in-capital
upon the adoption of SFASNo123R.   The effect of stock-based compensation was as follows

option plans and rights granted under the 2004 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP are estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes valuation model. Expected volatility was
estimated based on historical volatility of the Companys
stock, the implied volatility of traded options on the
Companys stock, the implied volatility of a peer group of
companies, and other factors. Expected term was estimated based
on the contractual life of the instrument, the vesting period of
the grant, historical exercise behavior, and other factors. The

unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options
granted under both of the Companys option plans. That cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
16years. The total fair value of shares vested was $3,546
and $1,486 during the years ended December31, 2006 and
2005, respectively.   Under the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation arrangements for employees, compensation cost is
recognized to the extent the fair value of the underlying common
stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock options at the
date of grant. Deferred stock-based compensation of $917 was
recorded during the year ended December31, 2004, for the
excess of fair value of the common stock underlying the options
at the date of grant over the exercise price of the options.
Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation related to
employee grants was $195 and $455 during the years ended
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   During the year ended December31, 2004, options to
purchase 30,000shares and 22,500shares of restricted
stock were granted to non-employees. Compensation benefit
expense resulting from these grants was $70, $50, and $227 in
the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.

Purchase Plan. In 2005, the initial offering under the ESPP
began on February21, 2005 and ended on May15, 2005.
Subsequent six month offering periods began on the first trading
day on or after May 16 and November16. The price of the
Companys common stock purchased pursuant to the offerings
is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the common
stock on the first and last day of the offering period.
Participants must remain employed by the Company for the entire
term of the offering in order to be eligible to purchase shares.
As of December31, 2006, the Company had authorized
1,375,846shares for issuance under the ESPP. The Company
issued 99,328 and 73,486shares at a weighted-average price
of $1105 and $919per share pursuant to the ESPP during

41     85   The realization of the tax benefits of deferred tax assets is
dependent on future levels of taxable income in the periods the
items are deductible or creditable. For periods prior to 2004,
the Company incurred a pre-tax loss in each period since
inception. Based on the available objective evidence, management
believes it is more likely than not that the domestic net
deferred tax assets will not be realizable. Accordingly, the
Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its
domestic net deferred tax assets as of December31, 2006
and 2005. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of
December31, 2006 and 2005 was $15,248 and $17,861,
respectively. The net change in the valuation allowance was a
decrease of $2,613 and an increase of $433 for the years ended
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   As of December31, 2006, the Company has net operating loss
carry-forwards of approximately $13,018 for federal and $6,985
for state tax purposes. If not utilized, these carry-forwards
will begin to expire in 2022 for federal tax purposes and 2010
for state tax purposes.   Pursuant to SFASNo123R, the Company maintains NOLs
and credits generated from excess tax benefits associated with
the accumulated stock award attributes in a memo account not
included in the deferred tax inventory balances. The additional
tax benefit associated with these stock award attributes is not
recognized until the deduction reduces cash taxes payable. At
December31, 2006, the Company has unbenefited stock option
deductions for federal and California purpose of $9,091 and
$6,985 respectively. When utilized these amounts will result in
a credit to stockholders equity. The Company has
unutilized state tax credits of $95 related to
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes, that
when benefited will result in a credit to stockholders
equity. These benefits will only be realized in accordance with
SFASNo123R.   As of December31, 2006, the Company has research credit
carry-forwards of approximately $3,949 and $4,347 for federal
and state tax purposes. If not utilized, the federal
carry-forwards will expire in various amounts beginning in 2016.
The California credit can be carried forward indefinitely. As of
December31, 2006, the Company has state manufacturer
investment tax credits MICof $159, which begin to expire
in 2009. As of December31, 2006, the Company has a federal
alternative minimum tax credit of $233, which can be carried
forward indefinitely.   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amount of benefit from net
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards may be impaired or
limited in certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations
in the amount of net operating losses that the Company may
utilize in any one year include, but are not limited to, a
cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over a
three-year period. As of December31, 2006, the Company has
determined that

50 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   Volterra Semiconductor Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Volterra Semiconductor Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Volterra Semiconductor Corporation and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2006, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   As described in Note2j to the consolidated financial
statements, in order to comply with the requirements of U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, Volterra Semiconductor
Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, in 2006
using the modified prospective method.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March8, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.   /s/KPMG

Controls
and Procedures   Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an
evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our chief executive
officer and chief financial officer collectively, our
certifying officers, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
Based on their evaluation, our certifying officers concluded
that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   Managements
Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework set forth in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set
forth in Internal Control Integrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2006. Our managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.   Inherent
Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Controls   We believe that a system of internal controls, no matter how
well designed and operated, is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and can be
affected by limitations inherent in all internal controls
systems including the realities that human judgment in
decision-making can be faulty, that persons responsible for
establishing controls need to consider their relative costs and
benefits, that breakdowns can occur because of human failures
such as simple error or mistake, and that controls can be
circumvented by collusion of two or more people. Accordingly, we
believe that our system of internal controls, while effective,
can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been
detected.   Changes

52 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   Volterra Semiconductor Corporation   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report of Internal Control over
Financial Reporting in Item9A, that Volterra Semiconductor
Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Volterra
Semiconductor Corporations management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that Volterra
Semiconductor Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion, Volterra Semiconductor Corporation
and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Volterra Semiconductor
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2006 and
2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 2006, and our
report dated March8, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.   As described in note2j to the consolidated financial
statements, in order to comply with the requirements of U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, Volterra Semiconductor
Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, in 2006
using the modified prospective method.   /s/KPMG
