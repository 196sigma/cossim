Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
MapInfo designs, develops, markets, licenses and supports location-based software and data products, application development tools, and industry-focused solutions, together with a range of consulting, training and technical support services. These products are sold through multiple distribution channels, including an indirect channel of value-added resellers and distributors, a corporate account sales force, and a telemarketing sales group. The Company products are translated into 20 languages and sold in 60 countries throughout the world. MapInfo markets its products worldwide through sales offices in North America, Europe, Australia, and throughout the rest of Europe and the Asia-Pacific region through exclusive and non-exclusive distribution relationships.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MapInfo Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the cash flows statements, the Company defines cash and cash equivalents as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined on the average cost method and consist primarily of computer media, user manuals and software packaging supplies.
Short-term Investments
The Company short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturity dates of one year or less. In accordance with SFAS No. 115, debt securities have been classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as held-to-maturity securities and are reported at amortized cost because the Company has the positive intent and the ability to hold these debt securities to maturity. Market value is determined by quoted market prices.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets two to seven years for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes. When assets are sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of, the applicable costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized.

1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Product Development Costs
Product development costs, including product enhancements and translation, are capitalized after technological feasibility has been established. These costs are reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and are being amortized on a straight-line basis up to two years, the estimated economic life of the products. Annual amortization under the straight-line method is greater than the ratio of current gross revenue to total expected product revenues method. 
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsSFAS 142 effective with its fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2001. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, at least annually, and written down when impaired. Furthermore, SFAS 142 requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives, unless the useful lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the useful lives of the respective assets and is being amortized over three to seven years.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition and SOP 98-9 Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions when all of the following conditions are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2 delivery has occurred, 3 the vendor fee is fixed or determinable, and 4 collectibility is probable.
Product revenue: Revenue from software and data product licenses is recognized upon the shipment of product or the granting of licenses.
Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM Revenue: Revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers is recorded when the product has been shipped and all obligations of the Company have been satisfied.
Value Added Reseller Sales: Revenue from product sales to distributors and resellers is recorded when related products are shipped.
Postcontract customer support PCS: PCS, inclusive of technical support and maintenance, may be bundled with an initial licensing fee or sold separately. In either case, the fair value of the PCS arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, generally over a one to two year period.
Multiple element arrangements. Multiple-element arrangements of the Company consist primarily of software licenses sold with 1-year maintenance arrangements. Maintenance arrangements are sold separately and accordingly, vendor specific objective evidence VSOE is determinable. Fees for multiple-element arrangements are allocated to the various elements of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements. The fair value used to allocate to the
MapInfo Corporation and Subsidiaries

1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
elements is based on VSOE of fair values of the elements. VSOE is determined by the price charged when the same element is sold separately.
Services revenue: Revenue from services such as training and consulting are recognized upon completion of the obligations.
Reserve for Returns
The Company as a matter of policy provides the buyer the right to return certain products within a stated period ranging from 30-60 days, for a refund of the purchase price or replacement of the product. Accordingly, the Company accrues for estimated future returns.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses all advertising costs as they are incurred.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable for future years to differences between financial statement and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect of tax rate changes on deferred taxes is recognized in the income tax provision in the period that includes the enactment date.
Business tax credits are recorded by the flow-through method of accounting, whereby they are applied as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credits are utilized.
The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.
Foreign Currency
The assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and the income statements are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating non-U.S. currency financial statements are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income. The Company exposure to foreign currency risk is mitigated, in part, by the fact that it incurs certain operating costs in the same foreign currencies in which revenues are denominated.
Computation of Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and diluted common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Diluted common equivalent shares consist of stock options using the treasury stock method.

Segment Information
The Company uses the management approach to reporting its segments. The management approach designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 143 requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which superseded Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30. This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and will be adopted by the Company on October 1, 2002. This statement specifies how impairment will be measured and how impaired assets will be classified in the financial statements. The Company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 145, Recission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002. This Standard addresses a number of items related to leases and other matters. The Company is required to adopt this Standard beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 145 to have a material effect on its financial statements.
In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which replaces Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. Under Statement No. 146, liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are to be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under EITF Issue 94-3, liabilities related to exit or disposal activities were recognized when an entity committed to an exit plan. In addition, SFAS No. 146 establishes that the objective for the initial measurement of the liability is fair value. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement will have on its financial statements but does not believe it will be material.

1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee. It also incorporates without change, the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34, Disclosure of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which is being superseded. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to g
uarantees issues or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor fiscal year-end. The disclosure requirements in FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on its financial statements.

5.Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsSFAS 142. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, at least annually, and written down when impaired, rather than being amortized as previous standards required. Furthermore, SFAS 142 requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives, unless the useful lives are determined to be indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the useful lives of the respective assets. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, however, the Company elected to adopt SFAS 142 effective with the Company fiscal year beginning on October 1, 2001. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill as of October 1, 2001, on which date the goodwill balance was $11,150. At September 30, 200
2, the goodwill balance was $12,104. The $954 increase in goodwill during fiscal 2002 primarily relates to the acquisition of Compusearch in Canada and the additional equity investment in Alps Mapping Co., Ltd. in Japan. 
The following table presents the impact of SFAS 142 on net income loss and earnings loss per share had the standard been in effect for fiscal 2001 Year Ended September 30 2002 2001 Reported net income loss 2,355 2,883 Amortization of goodwill  1,772 Income tax effect  532 Net adjustments  1,240 Adjusted net income loss 2,355 4,123 Reported basic earnings loss per share 016 020 Adjusted basic earnings loss per share 016 028 Reported diluted earnings loss per share 016 019 Adjusted diluted earnings loss per share 016 027 The Company is required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis. During the Company second fiscal quarter, an outside appraiser completed a valuation study of the significant elements of goodwill. The study concluded that there was no indication of impairment of goodwill. However, there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings.

Alps Mapping Co., Ltd.
In March 2000, the Company acquired 167% of the outstanding common stock of Alps Mapping Co., Ltd. Alps, a leading Japanese data provider headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. The Company invested 100,000 Yen approximately $750 to acquire the 167% equity position and 400,000 Yen approximately $3,700 in three debt instruments with warrants that could be converted over time into as much as a 51% common stock ownership position. In February 2002, the Company redeemed, at face value, one debt instrument of 100,000 Yen approximately $750.
