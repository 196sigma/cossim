Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and
Shareholders Open Text Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included under Part II, Item9A of this Form 10-K, that Open Text Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Open Text Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Open Text Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, Open Text Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of Open Text Corporation as of June30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June30, 2006, and our report dated
September5, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/KPMG LLP Toronto, Canada September5, 2006

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and
Shareholders Open Text Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Open Text Corporation and subsidiaries as of June30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June30, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Open Text Corporation as of June30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
June30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payments. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Open Text Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated September5, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting. /s/KPMG LLP Toronto, Canada September5, 2006

OPEN TEXT CORPORATION Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Tabular amounts in thousands, except per share data NOTE 1NATURE OF OPERATIONS Open Text Corporation the Company or Open Text develops,
markets, sells, and supports Enterprise Content Management ECM solutions. The Companys principal product is called Livelink. The Company offers its solutions both as end-user stand alone products and as fully integrated modules. Open Text markets and licenses its products
and services in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. NOTE 2SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of presentation These consolidated
financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Open
Text Corporation and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned with the exception of IXOS Software AG IXOS and Gauss Interprise AG, Gauss which as of June30, 2006, were 96% and 95% owned, respectively, and as
of June30, 2005, were 94% and 95% owned, respectively. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company has recorded a minority interest on its balance sheet in respect of IXOS to reflect the non-controlling
interest in IXOS. Since Gauss had a deficit in shareholders equity on acquisition, no minority interest has been recorded see Note 18Acquisitions to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of estimates The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions, which are evaluated on an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable at that time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. In particular, significant estimates, judgments and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, testing goodwill for impairment, the
valuation of acquired intangible assets, long-lived assets, the recognition of contingencies, facility and restructuring accruals, acquisition accruals, asset retirement obligations, realization of investment tax credits, and the valuation allowance
relating to the Companys deferred tax assets. Reclassifications Certain prior period comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to current period presentation including the reclassification of amortization of
acquired technology intangible assets to Cost of revenues from Amortization of acquired intangible assets set forth under Operating Expenses. The reclassification of amortization of acquired technology intangible assets to
Cost of revenues decreased gross profit by $162 million for the year ended June30, 2005, and $72 million of the year ended June30, 2004 from previously reported amounts, with no change to income from operations or net income loss per
share in any of the periods presented. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include investments that have terms to maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Cash equivalents are
recorded at cost and typically consist of term deposits, commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated Canadian federal government securities or short-term interest bearing investment-grade securities and demand accounts of a major Canadian chartered
bank. 
48 Table of Contents
Investments in marketable securities Investments in marketable securities are comprised of investments in the equity of a publicly listed corporation. The Company has classified this
investment as Available-for-Sale AfS. AfS investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. A decline in the market value
of any AfS security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. To determine whether an
impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs
evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year end, and forecasted performance of the investee. 
Capital assets Capital assets are stated
at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Gains and losses on asset disposals are taken into income in the year of disposition. The following represents the estimated useful lives of
capital assets:  Furniture and fixtures
5 to 10 years
Office equipment
5 years
Computer hardware
3 to 7 years
Computer software
3 years
Leasehold improvements
Over the term of the lease
Building
40 years
Business combinations The Company accounts for acquisitions of companies in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No141, Business
Combinations SFAS 141. The Company allocates the purchase price to tangible assets, intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the excess of purchase price, if any, being
allocated to goodwill. Impairment of long-lived assets The Company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with FASB SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144.
The Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups, such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances
which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses
associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds discounted projected future cash flows. The Company recorded an impairment of technology assets charge of $10 million during the year ended June30, 2006. See Note 20 Special Charges Recoveries
for more details. 
49 Table of Contents
Acquired intangibles This category consists of acquired technology and contractual relationships associated with various acquisitions, as well as trademarks and patents. Acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income-producing capabilities of software
products acquired on acquisitions. Acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. Contractual relationships represent relationships that the Company has with certain customers on contractual or legal rights and are considered separable. These contractual relationships were acquired by the Company
through business combinations and were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Contractual relationships are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The Company continually evaluates the remaining estimated useful life of its intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and
circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Goodwill FASB SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company does not amortize goodwill. The Company performed, in accordance with SFAS 142, its annual impairment analysis
of goodwill as of April1, 2006. Historically, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test coincident with its year-end of June30. In Fiscal 2005, the date of the test was moved to the first day of the fourth quarter, in
order to provide the Company with more adequate time to complete the analysis given the acceleration of public company reporting requirements. The Company believes that the accounting change described above is an alternative accounting principle
that is preferable under the circumstances and that the change was not intended to delay, accelerate or avoid an impairment charge. The analysis in all years indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the reporting units. If
estimates change, a materially different impairment conclusion could result. Allowance for doubtful accounts The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments. The Company
evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations, adjusts credit limits to the respective customers. In addition to these evaluations, the Company conducts on-going credit evaluations of its
customers payment history and current credit worthiness. The allowance is maintained for 100% of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and, for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible, an allowance is maintained for a
specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts, the Companys historical collection experience and current economic expectations. To date, the actual losses have been within management expectations. No single customer
accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of June30, 2006 and 2005. Asset retirement obligations 
The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with FASB SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS 143, which applies to certain obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. SFAS 143 requires that a liability be initially recognized for the 
50 Table of Contents
estimated fair value of the obligation when it is incurred. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset and the associated liability is accreted to the estimated fair value of the obligation at the settlement date through periodic accretion charges recorded within general
and administrative expenses. When the obligation is settled, any difference between the final cost and the recorded amount is recognized as income or loss on settlement. Revenue recognition a License revenues The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA in October 1997 as amended by SOP 98-9 issued in December 1998. The Company records product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the software product has been shipped, there are no significant uncertainties surrounding
product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable. The Company uses the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at
a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists. If an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement, revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor-specific
objective evidence VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered element. The Companys multiple-element
sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support PCS are sold together. The Company has established VSOE of the fair value of the undelivered PCS element based on the
contracted price for renewal PCS included in the original multiple element sales arrangement, as substantiated by contractual terms and the Companys significant PCS renewal experience, from its existing worldwide base. The Companys
multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew PCS after the bundled term ends. These rights are irrevocable to the customers benefit, are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any
economic or other penalty for failure to renew. Further, the renewal PCS options are for services comparable to the bundled PCS and cover similar terms. It is the Companys experience that customers generally exercise their renewal PCS option. In the renewal transaction, PCS is sold on a stand-alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original
multiple element sales arrangement. The renewal PCS price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all
elements have been delivered. The Company assesses whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with
normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring. The Companys sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms. These terms effectively relate to all customers, products, and arrangements regardless of customer
type, product mix or arrangement size. The only time exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs. In these jurisdictions, the Companys customary payment terms are in line
with local practice. b Service revenues Service revenues consist of revenues from consulting, implementation, training and integration services. These services are set forth
separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services. For those contracts where the services are not essential to the
functionality of any other element of the 
51 Table of Contents
transaction, the Company determines VSOE of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold
separately. These consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are, on average, less than six months in length. Revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are
rendered as the time is incurred by the Company. The Company also enters into contracts that are primarily fixed fee
arrangements to render specific consulting services. The percentage of completion method is applied to these more complex contracts that involve the provision of services relating to the design or building of complex systems, because these services
are essential to the functionality of other elements in the arrangement. Under this method, the percentage of completion is calculated based on actual hours incurred compared to the estimated total hours for the services under the arrangement. For
those fixed fee contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element, the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue. Revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the
period in which these services are performed. c Customer support revenues Customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide PCS to license holders. These revenues are recognized
ratably over the term of the contract. Advance billings of PCS are not recorded to the extent that the term of the PCS has not commenced or payment has not been received. Deferred revenue Deferred revenue primarily relates to support agreements which have been
paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services. Generally, the services will be provided in the next twelve months. Research and
development costs Research and development costs internally incurred in creating computer software to be sold, licensed or
otherwise marketed, are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization, described in FASB SFAS No86 Accounting for the Costs of Corporate Software to be Sold, Released, or Otherwise Marketed
SFAS 86. In accordance with SFAS 86, costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to expenses as incurred and capitalized between the dates that the product is considered to be technologically feasible and
is considered to be ready for general release to customers. In the Companys historical experience, the dates relating to the
achievement of technological feasibility and general release of the product have substantially coincided. In addition, no significant costs are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. As a result, the Company does not
capitalize any research and development costs relating to internally developed software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed. Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with FASB SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS 109. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or
deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that management considers it is more likely than not that a deferred
tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income, and the character of income tax assets and tax planning
strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.

In addition, the Company is subject to examinations by taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which
the Company operates in the normal course of operations. The Company regularly assesses the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes. Fair value of financial instruments Carrying
amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable trade and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the relatively short period of time between origination of
the instruments and their expected realization. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt approximates its carrying value based
upon changes in interest rates and credit risk. Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the majority of the Companys subsidiaries is the local currency. For such subsidiaries, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currencies at the year-end rate of exchange. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at historic rates, and revenue and expenses are translated
at average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses are reflected in the statements of income. The accounts of the Companys self-sustaining foreign operations for which the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the current rate method. Assets and liabilities are translated at
the year-end exchange rate, and revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. Unrealized gains and losses arising from the translation of the financial statements of these foreign
operations are accumulated in the Cumulative translation adjustment account, a separate component of shareholders equity. Restructuring charges The Company records restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other
exit costs in accordance with FASB SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146. SFAS 146 requires recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the
liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value. The Company records restructuring charges relating to employee termination costs
in accordance with FASB SFAS No112, Accounting for Post Employment Benefits SFAS 112. SFAS 112 applies to post-employment benefits provided to employees under on going benefit arrangements. In accordance with SFAS
112, the Company records such charges when the termination benefits are capable of being determined or estimated in advance, from either the provisions of the Companys policy or from past practices, the benefits are attributable to services
already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate. The recognition of restructuring charges requires
management to make certain judgments regarding the nature, timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities, including estimating sublease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of. At the end of each
reporting period, the Company evaluates the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances. Litigation The Company is a party, from time to time, in legal proceedings. In these cases, management assesses the likelihood that a loss will result, as well as
the amount of such loss and the financial statements provide for the Companys best estimate of such losses. To the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and result in the Company being required to pay an amount in excess of
what has been provided for in the financial statements, 
53 Table of Contents
the Company would be required to record, against earnings, such excess at that time. If the resolution resulted in a gain to the Company, or a loss less than
that provided for, such gain is recognized when received or receivable. Net income per share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding including contingently issuable shares where the
contingency has been resolved. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and stock equivalents outstanding using the treasury stock method during the year see Note 19 Net Income Per
Share in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Change in accounting policy Share-based payment On July1, 2005, the Company
adopted the fair value-based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee share-based compensation arrangements under the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. SFAS 123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transitional method. Previously, the Company had elected to account for employee share-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method based upon Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations. The intrinsic value method generally did not result in any
compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Under the modified prospective transitional method, share-based compensation is recognized for awards granted, modified, repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R. In addition, share-based
compensation is recognized, subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123R, for the remaining portion of the vesting period if any for outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption. Prior periods have not been adjusted and the Company
continues to provide pro forma disclosure as if it had accounted for employee share-based payments in all periods presented under the fair value provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, which is presented
below. The Company measures share-based compensation costs on the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award. The Company
has elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period, which in the Companys circumstances is the
stated vesting period of the award, provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested. Compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite
service is expected to be rendered. This estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known. Had the Company adopted the
fair value-based method for accounting for share-based compensation in all prior periods presented, the pro-forma impact on net income and net income per share would be as follows:  YearendedJune30,2005

Financial Statements for details of stock options and share-based compensation costs recorded during the year ended June30, 2006. Recently
issued accounting pronouncements Accounting changes and error corrections In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS 154, which replaces Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for, and reporting of, changes in
accounting principles and error corrections. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard
does not include specific transition provisions, unless it is impracticable to do so. Certain disclosures are also required for restatements due to correction of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made
in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005, and will be adopted by the Company for the year ended June30, 2007. The impact that the adoption of SFAS 154 will have on the Companys results of operations and financial condition
will depend on the nature of future accounting changes and the nature of transitional guidance provided in future accounting pronouncements. Accounting
for Uncertain Tax Positions In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48 on Accounting for Uncertain Tax
Positionsan interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes FIN 48. Under FIN
48, an entity should presume that a taxing authority will examine a tax position when evaluating the position for recognition and measurement; therefore, assessment of the probability of the risk of examination is not appropriate. In applying the
provisions of FIN 48, there will be distinct recognition and measurement evaluations. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based
solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of
benefit to recognize will be measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not, to be realized. The tax position should be derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained. On subsequent recognition and
measurement the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent managements best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, even though the outcome of the tax position
is not absolute or final. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement should be based on new information. A liability for interest or penalties or both will be recognized as deemed to be incurred based on the provisions of the tax law,
that is, the period for which the taxing authority will begin assessing the interest or penalties or both. The amount of interest expense recognized will be based on the difference between the amount recognized in the financial statements and the
benefit recognized in the tax return. On transition, the change in net assets due to applying the provisions of the final interpretation will be considered as a change in accounting principle with the cumulative effect of the change treated as an
offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of transition. FIN 48 will be effective as of the
beginning of the first annual period beginning after December15, 2006 and will be adopted by the Company for the year ended June30, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on its financial statements.

NOTE 3INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES The Companys investments in marketable securities consist of investments in the equity of Hummingbird Limited Hummingbird. The cost of
the investment was $211 million. Unrealized losses on this investment, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity. As of June30, 2006, the Company recorded a cumulative loss of $45,000. The
fair value of this investment as of June30, 2006 was approximately $210 million and was determined based on the closing price of Hummingbird on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold this investment
until market price recovery, this investment is not considered other than temporarily impaired. The Company did not own any investments in
marketable securities as of June30, 2005. On July5, 2006, the Company announced its intention to make an offer to purchase all
of the common shares of Hummingbird. For details relating to this offer see Note 22 Subsequent Events in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. NOTE 4CAPITAL ASSETS  As of June30, 2006 Cost

NOTE 9BANK INDEBTEDNESS Long-term debt Long-term debt consists of a 5 year mortgage agreement entered into during December 2005 with a
Canadian chartered bank. The principal amount of the mortgage is Canadian Dollars CDN $150 million. The mortgage has a fixed term of five years, maturing on January1, 2011, and is secured by a lien on the Companys building
in Waterloo, Ontario. Interest is to be paid monthly at a fixed rate of 525%per annum. Principal and interest are payable in monthly installments of CDN $101,000 with a final lump sum principal payment of CDN $126 million due on maturity.
The mortgage may not be prepaid in whole or in part at anytime prior to the maturity date. As of June30, 2006, the carrying values
of the building and mortgage were $164 million and $134 million, respectively. Credit facility On February2, 2006, the Company secured a new demand operating facility of CDN $400 million from a Canadian chartered bank. Borrowings under this
facility bear interest at varying rates depending upon the nature of the borrowings. The Company has pledged certain of its assets as collateral for this credit facility. There are no stand-by fees for this facility. As of June30, 2006 there
were no borrowings outstanding under this facility. NOTE 10ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES Current liabilities Accounts payable and accrued

Pension liabilities IXOS, in which the Company acquired a controlling interest in March 2004, has pension commitments to employees as well as to current and previous members of its executive board. The actuarial cost method used in
determining the net periodic pension cost, with respect to the IXOS employees, is the projected unit credit method. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the Companys pension plan are determined using methodologies that involve
various actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on assets. The Companys policy is to deposit amounts with an insurance company to cover the actuarial present value of the
expected retirement benefits. The total held in short-term investments as of June30, 2006 was $26 million June 30, 2005 $23 million, while the fair value of the pension obligation as of June30, 2006 was $30 million June 30,
2005 $29 million. Asset retirement obligations The Company is required to return certain of its leased facilities to their original state at the conclusion of the lease. The Company has accounted for such obligations in accordance with SFAS 143. At June30,
2006, the present value of this obligation was $39 million June 30, 2005 $49 million with an undiscounted value of $48 million June 30, 2005 $68 million. These leases were primarily assumed in connection with the IXOS
acquisition. Excess facility obligations and accruals relating to acquisitions The Company has accrued for the cost of excess facilities both in connection with its Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2006 restructuring, as well as with a number
of its acquisitions. These accruals represent the Companys best estimate in respect of future sub-lease income and costs incurred to achieve sub-tenancy. These liabilities have been recorded using present value discounting techniques and will
be discharged over the term of the respective leases. The difference between the present value and actual cash paid for the excess facility will be charged to other income over the terms of the leases ranging between several months to 17 years.
Transaction-related costs include amounts provided for certain pre-acquisition contingencies.

3,782,649 1069 Share-Based Payments Summary of Outstanding Stock Options As of June30, 2006, options to purchase an aggregate of
5,334,016 Common Shares are outstanding under all of the Companys stock option plans. In addition, 654,470 Common Shares are available for issuance under the 1998 Stock Option Plan and the 2004 Stock Option Plan, which are the only plans under
which the Company may issue further options. The Companys stock options generally vest over four to five years and expire ten years from the date of the grant and the exercise price of options granted is equivalent to the fair market value of
the stock at the date of grant except as noted hereinafter in the case of non-employee members of the Board of Directors only. 
65 Table of Contents
Options granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors vest as of the date of the
Companys Annual General Meeting of shareholders immediately following the date of the grant of the options. The exercise price of options granted is usually equivalent to the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant but in no event
is the exercise price less than the market price at the date of grant, as defined in the relevant stock option plan. During the year ended June30, 2006, the exercise price of options granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors,
was $2000 which was higher than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. A summary of option activity under the
Companys stock option plans for the year ended and as at June30, 2006 is as follows:  Number ofOptions Weighted-AverageExercisePrice

391 14,185 The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123R and United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No107. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, while the options issued by the Company are subject to both vesting and restrictions on transfer. In addition, option-pricing models require input of subjective
assumptions including the estimated life of the option and the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the estimated life of the option. The Company uses historical volatility as a basis for projecting the expected volatility of the
underlying stock and estimates the expected life of its stock options based upon historical data. The Company believes that the valuation
technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of the Companys stock option grants. Estimates of fair value are not intended, however, to predict actual future events or
the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards. For the year ended June30, 2006, the weighted-average fair
value of options granted, as of the grant date, was $768, using the following weighted average assumptions: expected volatility of 52%; risk-free interest rate of 46%; expected dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 52 years. A forfeiture
rate of 5%, based on historical employee turnover rates, was used to determine the net amount of compensation expense recognized. For the
year ended June30, 2005, the weighted-average fair value of options granted, as of the grant date, during the periods was $835, using the following weighted-average assumptions: expected volatility of 61%; risk-free interest rate of 32 expected dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 43 years. For the year ended June30, 2004, the weighted-average fair value of
options granted, as of the grant date, during the periods was $1033, using the following weighted-average assumptions: expected volatility of 60%; risk-free interest rate of 30%; expected dividend yield of 0%; and expected life of 35 years.
In each of the above periods, no cash was used by the Company to settle equity instruments granted under share-based compensation
arrangements. 
66 Table of Contents
The fair value of awards granted prior to July1, 2005 is not adjusted to be consistent with the
provision of SFAS 123R from the amounts disclosed previously, on a pro forma basis, in the audited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Form 10-Ks or in the notes to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Companys Form 10-Qs except that the unvested portion at the date of adoption is adjusted to reflect the Companys estimate of forfeitures. As of June30, 2006, the total compensation cost related to unvested stock
awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was $92 million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years. Share-based compensation cost included in the statement of income for the year ended June30, 2006 was approximately $52 million. Deferred tax assets of $622,000 were recorded, as of June30, 2006 in
relation to the tax effect of certain stock options that are eligible for a tax deduction when exercised. The Company has not capitalized any share-based compensation costs as part of the cost of an asset. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123R, for
the year ended June30, 2006 was a decrease in net income of $46 million, net of related tax effects, and a decrease to net income per share of $009 on both a basic and diluted share basis. For the year ended June30, 2006, cash in the amount of $37 million was received as the result of the exercise of options granted under share-based
payment arrangements. The tax benefit realized by the Company, during the year ended June30, 2006 from the exercise of options eligible for a tax deduction was $865,000 which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP Prior to July1, 2005, the Company offered its employees the opportunity to buy its Common Shares, through an employee stock purchase plan ESPP at a purchase price equal to the lesser of 85% of the weighted-average
trading price of the Common Shares based on the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX or NASDAQ in the period of five trading days immediately preceding the first business day of the purchase period and 85% of the weighted average trading price
of the Common Shares in the period of five trading days immediately preceding the last business day of the purchase period. The ESPP, under its original terms, qualified as a non-compensatory plan under APB 25 and as such no compensation cost was
recorded in relation to the discount offered to employees for purchases made under the ESPP. The original terms of the ESPP would have
resulted in it being treated as a compensatory plan under the fair value-based method. Effective July1, 2005, the Company amended the terms of its ESPP to set the amount at which Common Shares may be purchased by employees to 95% of the
average market price based on the TSX or NASDAQ on the last day of the purchase period. The choice of the appropriate market for determining the average market price is based upon the market that had the greatest volume of trading of Common Shares
in that period. As a result of the amendments, the ESPP is no longer considered a compensatory plan under the provisions of SFAS 123R, and as a result no compensation cost has been recorded in relation to the ESPP for the year ended June30,
2006. During the year ended June30, 2006, 281,093 Common Shares were issued under the ESPP for cash collected from employees
totaling $34 million. In addition, cash in the amount of $660,000 was received from employees that will be used to purchase Common Shares in future periods. During the year ended June30, 2005, 260,000 Common Shares were issued under the ESPP for cash collected from employees totaling $44 million. During the year ended June30, 2004, 305,000 Common Shares were issued under the ESPP for cash collected from employees totaling $34 million.

Rental expense of $113 million, $155 million and $143 million was recorded during the fiscal years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The long-term debt obligations are comprised of interest and principal payments on the 5 year mortgage on the Companys
recently constructed building in Waterloo, Ontario. See Note 9 Bank Indebtedness under the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not enter into off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space, computer equipment and vehicles. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, neither the lease
liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet, as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for capitalization. Domination agreements IXOS domination agreements On December1, 2004, the Company announced that it had entered into a domination and profit transfer agreement the IXOS DA with IXOS.
The IXOS DA came into force in August 2005 when it was registered in the commercial register at the local court in Munich. Under the terms of the IXOS DA, Open Text acquired authority to issue directives to the management of IXOS. Also within the
terms of the IXOS DA, Open Text offered to purchase the remaining Common Shares of IXOS for a cash purchase price of Euro 938per share Purchase Price which was the weighted average fair value of the IXOS Common Shares as of
December1, 2004. Additionally, Open Text has guaranteed a payment by IXOS to the minority shareholders of IXOS of an annual compensation of Euro 042per share Annual Compensation. The IXOS DA was registered on August23, 2005. In the quarter ended September30, 2005, the Company commenced accruing the amount payable to
minority shareholders of IXOS on account of Annual Compensation. This amount has been accounted for as a guaranteed dividend, payable to the minority shareholders, and is recorded as a charge to minority interest in the statements of
income for the year ended June30, 2006. Based on the number of minority IXOS shareholders as of June30, 2006, the estimated
amount of Annual Compensation was approximately $504,000 for the fiscal year ended June30, 2006. Because the Company is unable to predict, with reasonable accuracy, the number of IXOS minority shareholders in future periods, the Company is
unable to predict the amount of Annual Compensation that will be payable in future years. Certain IXOS shareholders have filed for a
procedure granted under German law at the district court of Munich, Germany, asking the court to reassess the amount of the Annual Compensation and the Purchase Price 
68 Table of Contents
the IXOS Appraisal Procedures for the amounts offered under the IXOS DA. It cannot be predicted at this stage, whether the court will increase
the Annual Compensation and/or the Purchase Price in the IXOS Appraisal Procedures. The purchase offer made under the IXOS DA will expire at the end of the IXOS Appraisal Procedures. These disputes are a normal and probable part of the process of acquiring minority shares in Germany. The costs associated with the above mentioned
shareholder objections to the fair value of the Annual Compensation and the Purchase Price are direct incremental costs associated with the ongoing step acquisitions of shares held by the minority shareholders and have been deferred within Goodwill
pending the outcome of the objections. The Company is unable to predict the future costs associated with these activities that will be payable in future periods. Gauss domination agreements Pursuant to a domination agreement dated November4, 2003
the Gauss DA between Open Text and Gauss, Open Text has offered to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of Gauss at a price of Euro 106per share the Gauss Purchase Price I. As a result of certain shareholders
having filed for a special court procedure to reassess the amount of the Gauss Purchase Price I that must be payable to minority shareholders as a result of the Gauss DA the Gauss Appraisal Procedure I, the acceptance period has been
extended pursuant to German law until the end of such proceedings. In addition, in April 2004 Gauss announced that effective July1, 2004 the shares of Gauss would cease to be listed on a stock exchange. In connection with this delisting, on
July2, 2004, a second offer by Open Text to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of Gauss at a price of Euro 106per share Gauss Purchase Price II, commenced. This acceptance period has also been extended pursuant to
German law until the end of proceedings to reassess the amount of the consideration offered under German law in the delisting process the Gauss Appraisal Procedure II. The shareholders resolution on the Gauss DA and on the
delisting was subject to a court procedure in which certain shareholders of Gauss claimed that the resolution by which the shareholders of Gauss approved of the entering into the Gauss DA and the authorization to the management board of Gauss to
file for a delisting are null and void. As a result of an out of court settlement, the complaints have been withdrawn and it has been agreed between Open Text and the minority Gauss shareholders that an amount of Euro 005per share per annum
the Gauss Annual Compensation will be payable as compensation to certain shareholders of Gauss under certain circumstances, but only after registration of the Squeeze Out as defined hereafter. The Gauss Appraisal Procedures I and II
are still pending. It cannot be predicted at this stage, whether the court will increase the Gauss Purchase Price and/or the Gauss Annual Compensation. In Germany, once ownership of 95% of the shares of a company is obtained, an acquirer can go through a Squeeze-Out process which is very similar to the Domination Agreement process. The only difference is
if the Squeeze Out is registered, the shares of minority shareholders are transferred automaticallyby virtue of the lawto the acquirer. On August25, 2005, at the shareholders meeting of Gauss, upon a motion of Open Text, it was
decided to transfer the shares of the minority shareholders, which at the time of the shareholders meeting held less than 5% of the shares of Gauss, to Open Text Squeeze Out. The resolutions will become effective when registered
in the commercial register at the local court of Hamburg. Registration of these resolutions is currently pending. Certain shareholders of Gauss have filed suits to oppose all or some of the resolutions of the shareholders meeting of
August25, 2005. Additionally, a fast track motion has been commenced by Gauss to apply for registration, which is still pending in the Court of Appeals in Hamburg. The First Instance Court of Hamburg ruled on February13, 2006
that the resolution on the Squeeze Out was void; Gauss has appealed the judgment and believes that the decision of the First Instance Court of Hamburg will be overturned, but the outcome of the appeal is uncertain at this time. On July14,
2006, the shareholders meeting of Gauss confirmed the Squeeze Out resolution; however, registration is still pending. The Company believes
that the registration of these resolutions is a reasonable certainty. Accordingly, the Company has recorded its best estimate of the amount payable to the minority shareholders of Gauss under the 
69 Table of Contents
Squeeze Out. As of June30, 2006, the Company accrued $75,000 for such payments. The Company is not currently able to determine the final amount payable
and it is unable to predict the date on which the resolutions will be registered in the commercial register. The Company continues to
incur direct and incremental costs in connection with the Squeeze Out procedures and registration thereof and have been deferred within Goodwill pending the outcome of the Squeeze Out procedures. The Company is unable to predict the future costs
associated with these activities that will be payable in future periods. Guarantees and indemnifications The Company has entered into license agreements with customers that include limited intellectual property indemnification clauses. Generally, the Company
agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that the Companys software products infringe certain third party intellectual property rights. In the event of such a claim, the Company is generally obligated to defend its customers
against the claim and either settle the claim at the Companys expense or pay damages that its customers are legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. These intellectual property infringement indemnification clauses generally are
subject to limits based upon the amount of the license sale. The Company has not made any indemnification payments in relation to these indemnification clauses. In connection with certain facility leases, the Company has guaranteed payments on behalf of its subsidiaries either by providing a security deposit with the landlord or through unsecured bank guarantees obtained from
local banks. Additionally, the Companys current end-user license agreement contains a limited software warranty. The Company has not
recorded a liability for guarantees, indemnities or warranties described above in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet since the maximum amount of potential future payments under such guarantees, indemnities and warranties is not
determinable. Litigation The
Company is subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the
Companys management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. NOTE 14OTHER INCOME EXPENSE Included in
other income expense for the year ended June30, 2006 are primarily foreign exchange losses of $48 million. Included in other
income expense for the year ended June30, 2005 are primarily foreign exchange losses of $18 million and an amount of $754,000 relating to interest charges and legal costs incurred on the settlement of the action brought against the Company
by the Harold L. Tilbury and Yolanda O. Tilbury, Trustees of the Harold L. Tilbury Jr. and Yolanda O. Tilbury Family Trust. Included in
other income expense for the year ended June30, 2004 is a loss on the disposition of a small equity investment in the amount of $74,000 and foreign exchange gains of $291,000. NOTE 15INCOME TAXES The Company operates in several tax jurisdictions. Its income is subject
to varying rates of tax and losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another.

recognition of $193 million June 30, 2005$35 million in pre-acquisition tax benefits of acquired companies was recorded as an adjustment reduction to goodwill. As at June30, 2006, a valuation allowance of $943 million June 30, 2005$1136 million has been recorded on acquired deferred tax assets in
business combinations where the Company had concluded that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the acquired tax benefits would not be realized in the future. Subsequent recognition of these tax benefits will be applied as a reduction
in goodwill.

The Company has approximately $221 million of domestic non-capital loss carryforwards which expire
between 2007 and 2016 and $102 million of domestic capital loss carryforwards that have no expiry date. In addition, the Company has $3798 million of foreign non-capital loss carry forwards of which $2403 million have no expiry date. $281
million of these are U.S. losses that are restricted and can only be used against the profits of a previously acquired company in accordance with a statutory formula. The remainder of the foreign losses expire between 2007 and 2025. The Company also
has $19 million of foreign capital loss carryforwards that have no expiry date. In addition, investment tax credits of $84 million will expire between 2014 and 2016.

deferred tax assets that a valuation allowance is required. The Company continues to evaluate its taxable position quarterly and considers factors by taxing jurisdiction, such as estimated taxable income, the history of losses for tax purposes and
the growth of the Company, among others. NOTE 16SEGMENT INFORMATION SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information establishes standards for the reporting by public
business enterprises of information about operating segments, products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The method of determining what information to report is based on the way that management organizes the operating segments
within the Company for making operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. 
72 Table of Contents
The Companys operations fall into one dominant industry segment, being enterprise content
management software. The Company manages its operations, and accordingly determines its operating segments, on a geographic basis. The Company has two reportable segments: North America and Europe. The Company evaluates operating segment performance
based on revenues and direct operating expenses of the segment, based on the location of the respective customers. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies. No segments
have been aggregated. Included in the following operating results are allocations of certain operating costs that are incurred in one
reporting segment but which relate to all reporting segments. The allocations of these common operating costs are consistent with the manner in which they are allocated for the chief operating decision maker CODM of the Companys
analysis. For the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Other category consists of geographic regions other than North America and Europe. Revenues from transactions that both emanate and conclude within operating segments
are not considered for the purpose of this disclosure since such transactions are not reviewed by the CODM. Adjusted operating margin from
operating segments does not include amortization of acquired intangible assets, provision for recovery of restructuring charges, other income expense, share-based compensation and provision for income taxes. Goodwill and other acquired
intangible assets have been assigned to segment assets based on the relative benefit that the reporting units are expected to receive from the assets, or the location of the acquired business operations to which they relate. These allocations have
been made on a consistent basis. Information about reportable segments is as follows:  Yearended June30,2006

Fiscal 2004 IXOS On October21, 2003, Open Text announced that it had entered into a business combination agreement with
IXOS. The transaction was consummated via a tender offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of IXOS for either cash or a combination of Common Shares and Common Share purchase warrants the Alternative
Consideration of Open Text. On February19, 2004, Open Text closed the tender offer, pursuant to which, a wholly owned
subsidiary, 2016091 Ontario, acquired a total of 19,157,428 IXOS shares or approximately 88% of the ordinary share capital and voting rights of IXOS, including shares acquired in the open market. Of these IXOS shares, 17,792,529 shares
approximately 93% of the tendered shares were tendered for the Alternative Consideration as described below, with the balance, including shares purchased on the open market, acquired for approximately $153 million in cash. The Alternative
Consideration for each IXOS share consisted of 05220 of an Open Text Common Share and 01484 of a warrant. Each whole warrant was exercisable to purchase one Open Text Common Share and could be exercised at any time prior to February19, 2005
at a strike price of $2075 per share. Between the closing date of the tender offer and June30, 2004, Open Text acquired an additional 203,647 Common Shares of IXOS for $23 million in cash. As a result of the additional purchase, 2016091
Ontario obtained a total of 19,361,075 IXOS shares or approximately 89% ownership of IXOS. Approximately 93million Open Text shares
were issued in conjunction with the tender offer for IXOS. These shares were valued using the average share price two days before and two days after the acquisition was agreed to and announced. Accordingly, the fair value of these shares was
approximately $191 million. Approximately 26million warrants were issued in conjunction with the Alternative Consideration. The
fair value of each warrant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  Volatility
60 Risk-free interest rate
35 Dividend yield Expected life
1year
Based on this methodology, the warrants were valued at $940 each, resulting in a total value of
approximately $25 million. As at June30, 2004, 224,572 warrants were exercised. In the third quarter of Fiscal 2005, all of the outstanding warrants expired unexercised. The carrying value of the unexercised warrants of $223 million was
reclassified as additional paid in capital at the time of expiry. The results of operations of IXOS have been included in Open Texts
consolidated results from March1, 2004. IXOS is a leading vendor of solutions for ECM. IXOS enterprise solutions help businesses
achieve efficient management and display of web information, optimization of business processes, and secure, long-term archiving of all business documents in a highly-scaleable document repository.

Adjustments made to the IXOS purchase price equation relate primarily to incremental shares purchased within Fiscal 2006 and certain purchase price adjustments made within the
allocation period as defined by SFAS 141. Other adjustments to the purchase price equation in the current fiscal year relate
to:  The recognition of certain deferred tax assets in respect of pre-acquisition tax attributes of IXOS in accordance with SFAS 109 ;  Adjustments to goodwill relating to employee termination costs and excess facilities in accordance with EITF 95-3;  Adjustments to goodwill relating to transaction costs accounted for in accordance with SFAS 141.  b
The Company increased its ownership of IXOS to approximately 96% during the year ended June30, 2006. This was done by way of purchases of IXOS shares. Prior to these
purchases, Open Text held, as of June30, 2005, approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of IXOS. Total consideration of $51 million was paid for the purchase of IXOS shares during the year ended June30, 2006. The Company stepped up
its share of the fair value increments of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of IXOS to the extent of the increased ownership of IXOS. The minority interest in IXOS has been reduced to reflect the appropriate lower minority interest
ownership in IXOS. The impact of these step purchases has been reflected in the purchase allocation table above. The portion

As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized liabilities in connection with the
acquisition of IXOS totaling approximately $476 million. The liabilities recognized include severance and related charges in connection with a worldwide reduction in the IXOS workforce, in addition to transaction costs and costs relating to
provisioning for excessive facilities. Of the approximately $476 million in total liabilities recognized in connection with the acquisition, approximately $180 million remains accrued at June30, 2006. This amount is primarily attributable to
excess facilities which will be paid over the term of the respective leases. IXOS had approximately $1461 million Fiscal 2005 
$1235 million of net operating loss carry forwards and other future deductions at June30, 2006. As of June30, 2005, the Company had recorded $41 million of deferred tax assets in the purchase price allocation related to these
operating loss carryforwards and other future deductions since it was considered unlikely that the Company would be able to utilize most of the loss carry forwards and other future deductions. As of June30, 2006, the gross deferred tax asset
related to these loss carry forwards and other future deductions was $265 million and was offset by a valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities totaling $238 million. During Fiscal 2006, the Company utilized $165 million of these acquired
tax losses with regard to future loss utilizations resulting in a reduction of goodwill of $32 million. The Company will continue to review and evaluate these net operating loss carry forwards and other future deductions. If the Company determines
that it is more likely than not that it will realize the tax attributes related to IXOS in the future, the related decrease in the valuation allowance will reduce goodwill instead of the provision for taxes. During Fiscal 2005, a Director of the Company received $220,000 in consulting fees for assistance with the acquisition of IXOS. These fees are included
in the acquisition costs. The Director abstained from voting on this transaction. Gauss On October16, 2003, 2016090 Ontario Inc. Ontario, a wholly owned subsidiary of Open Text, acquired approximately 75% of the shares of
Gauss Interprise AG Gauss pursuant to several sale and purchase agreements with major shareholders. The results of Gauss operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of Open Text since that date. As of
June30, 2006, Open Text had acquired approximately 95% of the common shares of Gauss as a result of these agreements, as well as through the purchase of common shares on the open market and through a public tender offer. Total cash
consideration paid for the Companys interest in Gauss is $103 million. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Gauss acquisition.

North America 11,501
Europe 5,412 16,913 No minority interest was recorded as part of the purchase price as the net book value of
Gauss assets and liabilities was in a deficit position. To the extent Gauss incurs losses subsequent to the acquisition date; the Company will recognize the full amount of those losses. If Gauss generates income subsequent to the acquisition
date, the Company will account for that income as follows:  i
Credit the full amount into income to the extent of post-acquisition losses charged against income;  ii
Credit the minoritys share in the income against goodwill or additional-paid-in capital to the extent that those amounts adjust the basis of the acquired minority interest to
zero; and  iii
Credit any excess of the minority interests share in the income of the acquired enterprise to the minority interests. The customer assets of $45 million and the technology assets of $52 million have estimated useful lives of five years. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized liabilities in connection with the acquisition of Gauss totaling $42 million. The
liabilities recognized include severance and related charges in connection with a worldwide reduction in the Gauss workforce, transaction costs and costs relating to provisioning for excess facilities. Of the total liabilities recognized in
connection with the acquisition, $34,000 remains accrued at June30, 2006. Liabilities related to transaction-related charges are expected to be paid in Fiscal 2007. Liabilities related to facilities will be paid over the term of the lease.
During Fiscal 2005, a Director of the Company received $170,000 in consulting fees for assistance with the acquisition of Gauss. These
fees are included in the acquisition costs. The Director abstained from voting on this transaction. Domea eGovernment On October23, 2003, Open Text acquired all the common shares of DOMEA eGovernment for total consideration of up to $114 million, subject to meeting
certain revenue performance and certain adjustments based on the Companys assets and liabilities. The results of DOMEA eGovernments operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements of Open Text since that date.
DOMEA eGovernment develops and markets the DOMEA eGovernment software solution. The purchase price included contingent consideration of up to $38 million that could be earned by the former shareholders of DOMEA eGovernment based on the achievement of certain revenue targets
through December31, 2004. Amounts earned under this arrangement were to be paid in the form of 50% cash and 50% in Open Text Common Shares. The revenue targets were achieved and accordingly $813,000 was recorded in the year ended June30,
2005, as due and payable to the former shareholders of Domea eGovernment, and $813,000 was recorded within shareholders equity representing the fair value of the Companys commitment to issue Common Shares. Based on the share purchase
agreement, $813,000 of cash was paid on July5, 2005 and the shares were issued on September1, 2005.

useful life of five years. As part of the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized liabilities in connection with the acquisition
of DOMEA eGovernment totaling $400,000. The liabilities recognized relate to transaction costs related to this acquisition. This liability has been fully paid as of June30, 2005. During Fiscal 2005, a Director of the Company received $90,000 in consulting fees for assistance with the acquisition of DOMEA eGovernment. These fees
are included in the acquisition costs. The Director abstained from voting on this transaction. Asset Acquisitions During Fiscal 2004, the Company acquired the assets of two companies through share purchases for total consideration of $22 million. The principal assets
acquired for these acquisitions were both technology and tax assets. The tax assets had fair values of $68 million and $37 million, respectively. As the benefit of the tax losses exceeded the purchase price after allocating estimated fair values
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $120 million and a deferred credit of $101 million in respect of these acquisitions. As the losses are utilized the deferred tax asset and deferred credit
will decrease proportionately and the Company will recognize the net benefit of the losses in its income tax expense for the period.

$38 million were recorded against capital assets that were written down to fair value, including various leasehold improvements at vacated premises and redundant office equipment. Fair value was determined based on the Companys estimates of
disposal proceeds, net of anticipated costs to sell. Impairment of intangible assets During the year ended June30, 2006, impairment charges of $10 million were recorded relating to a write-down of intellectual property in North
America.The intellectual property represents the fair value of acquired technology from the Corechange acquisition which closed in the 2003 fiscal year.The triggering event that gave rise to the impairment was a shift in the marketing
and development strategy associated with this acquired technology and an assessment of where the technology is in terms of the Companys assessment of the product lifecycle. In addition, the Company has changed its estimate of the remaining
useful life of the intellectual property from four to two years. The change in estimate will be accounted for on a prospective basis. The impairment was measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted projected future net cash
flows. NOTE 21RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During Fiscal 2006,Mr. Stephen Sadler, a director of the Company,earned $37,000 Fiscal 2005 $315,970, Fiscal 2004 $480,000 in consulting fees for assistance with acquisition activities. NOTE 22SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On July5, 2006,

Controls and Procedures A Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, with the participation of the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 epromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. B Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15f, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures of are being made
only in accordance with the authorizations of our management and our directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a
material effect on our financial statements. Our management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of June30,
2006, the end of our fiscal year. In making our assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
our assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June30, 2006. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect our Disclosure Controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls
can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of control effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
