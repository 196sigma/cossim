ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.                 MERIX CORPORATION
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Merix Corporation
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Merix Corporation as of May
29, 1999 and May 30, 1998 and the related statements of income, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years ended May 29, 1999, May 30, 1998, and May
31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Merix Corporation as of May 29, 1999 and May
30, 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years
ended May 29, 1999, May 30, 1998, and May 31, 1997 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

MERIX CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts Note 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
Merix Corporation, an Oregon corporation, was formed in March 1994 to succeed
the business conducted by the Circuit Board Division of Tektronix, Inc.
Tektronix. On June 1, 1994, Merix acquired the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the division in connection with the initial public offering of
its common stock, and began to operate as an independent corporation.
Fiscal Year
The Company fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending the last Saturday
in May. Fiscal year 1999 was a 52-week year ending May 29, fiscal year 1998 was
a 52-week year ended May 30 and fiscal year 1997 was a 53-week year ended May
31. For convenience, these periods have been presented in these financial
statements as ended May 31.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Balance Sheet Financial Instruments: Fair Values
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for investments, accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate
or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount for
long-term debt approximates its fair value because the related interest rates
are comparable to rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar
terms and maturities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash in banks and highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Short-Term Investments
The Company classifies securities at acquisition into one of three categories:
held to maturity, available for sale, or trading. At May 31, 1999 and 1998, all
of the Company investments with original maturities of more than 90 days are
classified as held to maturity and are valued at amortized cost.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials,
labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out
FIFO basis.

Note 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Continued
Property and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Costs of improvements, including capitalized interest, are capitalized.
Depreciation is calculated based on the estimated useful lives of depreciable
assets as follows: 40 years for buildings, 10 to 20 years for grounds, 3 to 7
years for machinery and equipment, and is provided using the straight-line
method.
Long-lived Assets
The Company long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the sum of expected
undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a
loss is recognized.
Goodwill
The cost of goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
period benefited of 15 years. Goodwill amortization for fiscal years 1999, 1998,
and 1997 was $41, $167 and $169, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized at the time of shipment. Service
revenue is recognized as services are provided.
Engineering Expense
Expenditures for engineering of products and manufacturing processes are
expensed as incurred.
Warranty
The Company generally warrants its products for a period of up to four months
from shipment. Accordingly, a provision for the estimated cost of the warranty
is recorded upon shipment.
Net Loss Income Per Share
Basic net loss income per share is computed using the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted income per share
is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
dilutive common equivalent shares related to stock options outstanding during
the period. Incremental shares, related to outstanding stock options of 78,501
and 114,061 for fiscal years 1998 and 1997 were included in the calculations of
diluted net income per share.
Diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding for the period. Stock options to purchase 1,260,890
shares were not included in the net loss per share calculation for the fiscal
year 1999, because to do so would have been antidilutive. Of the stock options
outstanding at May 29, 1999, 884,440 had exercise prices above the market price
of the underlying common stock at that date.

Comprehensive Loss Income
In fiscal year 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income which establishes
requirements for disclosure of comprehensive income and is effective for the
Company fiscal year ending May 1999. Reclassification of earlier financial
statements for comparative purposes is required. Comprehensive loss income did
not differ from currently reported net loss income in the periods presented.
Segment Reporting
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information SFAS 131 in fiscal year 1999. Based on definitions
contained within SFAS 131, the Company has determined that it operates within
one segment. Additionally, the Company has no material revenues from external
customers outside the United States and has no long-lived assets outside the
United States. See Note 11 for information regarding significant customers.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes accounting
and reporting standards requiring every derivative instrument be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS
133 also requires changes in the derivative fair value be recognized currently
in results of operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. SFAS
133, as amended by SFAS 137, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2000. The Company does not expect SFAS 133 to have a material impact on its
financial statements.
Reclassifications
Reclassifications of certain prior period balances have been made to conform
with the current method of presentation.
Note 2. RESTRUCTURING
In the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, the Company announced a restructuring
plan, undertaken to improve capacity utilization and lower the Company cost
structure. Pursuant to the restructuring plan, the Company closed its Loveland,
Colorado facility, reduced approximately 35 employees from administrative,
engineering and support functions at its Forest Grove, Oregon location and sold
its Soladyne facility in San Diego, California. The Soladyne facility was sold
in February 1999. Closure of the Loveland facility, which was completed in
October 1998, resulted in the layoff of approximately 340 manufacturing and
support employees. The Company transferred a portion of the Loveland production
and manufacturing equipment used in the Loveland facility to the Forest Grove
site. Installation of the manufacturing equipment should be completed by the end
of the second quarter of fiscal year 2000.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 1999, the Company reversed $7,109 of the
restructuring charge taken in the first quarter of the year. The reversal was
the result of a favorable termination of the

Company profitability, which included a work force reduction, the write-off of
certain manufacturing equipment and other miscellaneous costs. All liabilities

Note 3. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable and investments. In
total, six customers represented approximately 73% of the accounts receivable
balance at May 31, 1999, individually ranging from 5% to 19%. The risk in trade
accounts receivable is limited due to the creditworthiness of companies
comprising the Company customer base and their dispersion across many
different sectors of the electronics industry and geographies. The Company has
not had significant losses related to its accounts receivable in the past. The
risk in investments is limited due to the creditworthiness of investees
comprising the portfolio and the diversity of the portfolio. At May 31, 1999,
the Company does not believe it had any significant credit risks.

SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 defines a
fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options and similar
equity instruments and encourages all entities to adopt that method of
accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans. However, it also
allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using
the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 APB 25. Entities electing to remain with the accounting in APB 25 must make
pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented, net income per share, as
if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS 123 had been
adopted.
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under
