30, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of operations, 
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period 
ended September 30, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility 
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Tanisys Technology, Inc., 
and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998, 1997 AND 1996 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tanisys 
Technology, Inc. Tanisys and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 1st Tech 
Corporation 1st Tech, DarkHorse Systems, Inc. DarkHorse, Rosetta 
Marketing and Sales Inc., and a newly established subsidiary, Tanisys 
Europe Ltd., located in Scotland, collectively, the Company. 
The Company offers build-to-order services, designs and markets products 
consisting of semiconductor memory modules, designs and builds memory module 
testers and provides design services in conjunction with the licensing of its 
touch sensor products. 
Numerous factors affect the Company operating results, including, but 
not limited to, general economic conditions, competition, changing 
technologies, component shortages and price fluctuations. A change in any of 
these factors could have an adverse effect on the Company consolidated 
financial position or results of operations. The Company has experienced 
losses since inception. The continued success of the Company depends upon 
the Company ability to generate sufficient sales from the development of 
new products or increased sales of existing products. The Company believes 
that its existing funds, anticipated cash flows from operations, amounts 
available from future vendor credits, bank borrowings, capital and operating 
leases and equity financings will be sufficient to meet its working capital 
and capital expenditure needs for the next 12 months at the projected level 
of operations. However, should there be a significant increase in sales 
above projected levels which requires additional investments in equipment, 
inventory and accounts receivable, the Company would be required to obtain 
additional funding through debt and rely upon a future equity offering or 
offerings for such funding. There is no assurance that the Company would be 
able to locate debt funding or that it would be successful in its attempts to 
raise a sufficient amount of funds in an equity offering or offerings. The 
Company inability to raise needed funds to meet its projected level of 
operations or increase above current projections could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. All significant intercompany 
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities 
of three months or less to be classified as cash equivalents. Cash 
equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates market value. The 
Company places its cash investments in high credit quality instruments. 
Restricted cash represents deposits that are available only to pay down the 
revolving credit note. Note 6

INVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. In the third 
quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company changed its method of accounting for 
inventories from the first-in, first-out method to a weighted average cost 
basis. The change did not have a significant effect on results of operations 
for 1996, 1997 or 1998, nor is it anticipated that it will have a material 
effect on future periods. Prior to the change, the Company inventory costs 
would not have differed significantly under the two methods. Inventory costs 
include direct materials, direct labor and certain indirect manufacturing 
overhead expenses. Note 3
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives, which range from three to seven years. 
Leasehold improvements and assets subject to capital lease are amortized 
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the term of the lease or 
life of the asset. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Effective October 1, 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of 
Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. The impact of 
adoption was not material to the Company consolidated financial position or 
results of operations. Based on its review, the Company believes that no 
impairment has occurred from the adoption of this statement with respect to 
its property and equipment as of September 30, 1998. Note 4
GOODWILL
Goodwill has been amortized against earnings over two years. For the 
years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, amortization expense of 
approximately $2,092,000, $3,585,000 and $1,494,000, respectively, has been 
reflected in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements 
of operations. Note 2
MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
The mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was issued during 
fiscal 1998. The preferred stock contains a beneficial conversion feature 
which is being charged to accumulated deficit and is reflected as an increase 
to preferred stock up to the earliest date the preferred stock can be 
converted to Common Stock. Note 8
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The Company uses the U.S. Dollar as its functional currency, except for its
operations in Scotland. The Scotland subsidiary uses the Pound Sterling as its
functional currency. The Company Scotland operations are translated into U.S.
Dollars at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Income and expense
items are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period. 
The aggregate transaction gains and losses included in the determination of net
loss are not material for any period presented.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from sales is recognized when the related products are shipped, 
typically freight on board shipping point or at the time the services are 
rendered. The Company warrants products against defects, has a policy 
concerning the return of products and accrues the cost of warranting these 
products as they are shipped. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenses relate primarily to the technological 
development and enhancement of the Company products. Research and 
development costs are charged to expense as incurred.
LOSS PER SHARE
Loss per share is calculated based upon the weighted average number of 
common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the 
year. Diluted loss applicable to Common Stock per share does not assume 
conversion of the Company mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred 
stock due to the anti-dilutive nature of the calculation. Note 11 
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued 
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards 
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in a 
full set of general purpose financial statements. This statement is 
effective for the Company in fiscal 1999. The Company believes that the 
adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on the financial 
position or results of operations of the Company.
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments 
of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 requires publicly 
held companies to report financial and other information about key 
revenue-producing segments of the entity for which such information is 
available and is utilized by the chief decision-maker. Specific information 
to be reported for individual segments includes profit or loss, certain 
revenue and expense items and total assets. A reconciliation of segment 
financial information to amounts reported in the financial statements is also 
to be provided. SFAS No. 131 is effective for the Company in fiscal year 
1999. The Company believes that the adoption of this statement will not have 
a material effect on the financial position or results of operations of the 
Company.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

fiscal 1998 presentation.
2.  ACQUISITIONS OF 1ST TECH AND DARKHORSE
On May 21, 1996, the Company acquired 1st Tech and DarkHorse, as a 
result of which 1st Tech and DarkHorse became wholly owned subsidiaries of 
the Company in exchange for an aggregate of 4,150,000 shares of the Company 
Common Stock. 1st Tech is engaged primarily in the design, manufacture and 
sale of standard memory products to the memory aftermarket and custom memory 
assemblies to original equipment manufacturers, and offers engineering design 
and contract manufacturing services. DarkHorse designs and markets memory 
testing equipment primarily to electronic equipment manufacturers.
At the closing of the acquisitions, the Company granted options for the 
purchase of 550,000 common shares to key employees of 1st Tech and DarkHorse, 
allowed the primary stockholder of 1st Tech, who is also one of the three 
former owners of DarkHorse, to appoint two members to the Company 
seven-member Board of Directors, and paid a consulting bonus to a Director of 
the Company of 207,500 common shares at a price of $380 per share.
The acquisitions of 1st Tech and DarkHorse were accounted for using the 
purchase method of accounting. The net purchase price was allocated as 
follows                                 
Purchase price                         $8,300,000
Assets acquired:
Working capital other than note payable          3,907,459
Fixed assets                        1,607,771
Other assets                         241,627
Liabilities assumed:
Note payable                       3,276,674

Commission paid                       788,500
Closing costs                        425,316
Excess of purchase price over net assets acquired - Goodwill  $7,170,998
The fair value of working capital, fixed assets, other assets, note 
payable and other liabilities was based on the historical cost from the 
financial statements of 1st Tech and DarkHorse. The fair value of the 
commission paid was 207,500 shares at a price of $380 at the date of 
issuance. Purchase price was determined as the number of shares issued to 
1st Tech and DarkHorse stockholders 4,150,000 at a per share price of 
$200, utilizing the offering price of the private placement of 1st Tech 
Common Stock immediately prior to the acquisition.

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1 per share Series A 
Stock, for $4 million. 
The Series A Stock is convertible into the Company no par value common
stock Common Stock at the option of the holder beginning 90 days after the
June 30, 1998 closing date. During the following 150 days, the holder has
agreed to convert no more than 15% of the Series A Stock if the Company meets
certain quarterly revenue targets. The conversion price is the lesser of the
fixed conversion price of $231 per share or a variable conversion price. The
Company has valued this beneficial conversion feature at approximately $14
million and has reflected this amount in additional paid-in capital. This
amount will be charged to the accumulated deficit through the earliest date of
conversion.

8.  PREFERRED STOCK continued
The Series A Stock carries mandatory redemption rights which can be 
exercised by the holder if certain triggering events occur. These redemption 
rights could require the Company to redeem the Series A Stock for cash based 
on a formula provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Company cannot 
estimate the redemption price or if or when the triggering events might 
occur. Therefore, the mandatory redemption feature has not been valued. 
Should a triggering event occur, the Company will record a charge to the 
accumulated deficit equal to the difference between the redemption price and 
the carrying value of the Series A Stock.
Dividends are payable quarterly in either cash or registered shares of 
Common Stock, but must be paid in cash upon the occurrence of certain events. 
For the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company paid a dividend of $50,000 
by issuing 40,000 shares of Common Stock.
Attached to the Series A Stock were warrants to purchase 199,999 shares 
of Common Stock at $300 per share. The warrants currently are exercisable 
and have a term of four years. The Company has valued the warrants at 
approximately $284,000 and has reflected this amount in additional paid-in 
capital.
At September 30, 1998, the carrying value of the Series A Stock consists 
of the following

STOCK OPTIONS 
The Company has two stock option plans. All options granted under the 
plans are exercisable for Common Stock as described below. The Company 
applies Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for 
Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for its 
plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for grants under 
the stock option plans since the exercise price of the options equals the 
fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. 
Had compensation cost for all stock option grants been determined based 
on their fair market value at the grant dates consistent with the method 
prescribed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the 
Company net loss and net loss per share would have been reduced to the pro 
forma amounts indicated below                            For the Year Ended September 30,

grants to the Company non-employee directors. The stock options granted 
under each of these plans are granted at fair market value on the date of 
grant, vest ratably over a predefined period and expire no more than ten 
years from the date of grant. At September 30, 1998, the Company had 
reserved a total of 5,890,000 shares of Common Stock for the plans.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted 
average assumptions used for grants in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996                 For the Year Ended September 30,

10. INCOME TAXES
For the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company incurred
consolidated net operating losses for U.S. income tax purposes of approximately
$5,252,000, $6,023,000 and $1,785,000, and for non-U.S. income tax purposes of
approximately $369,000 and $-0- and $-0-, respectively. The loss carryforwards
begin to expire in 2011. At September 30, 1998 and 1997, the Company had
temporary differences resulting in future tax deductions of approximately
$756,000 and $513,000, respectively, principally representing tax basis in
accrued liabilities and reserves. Deferred income tax assets from the loss
carryforwards and asset basis differences aggregate approximately $6,888,000 and
$4,649,000, at September 30, 1998, and 1997, respectively. 
For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance of $6,888,000 and
$4,649,000 at September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively, has been recorded to
offset the deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty as to whether the benefits
will be realized.
The availability of the net operating loss carryforwards and future tax
deductions to reduce taxable income is subject to various limitations under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code, in the event of an
ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Code. The Company may lose
the benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards due to Internal Revenue
Service IRS Code Section 382 limitations. This section states that after
reorganization or other change in corporate ownership, the use of certain
carryforwards may be limited or prohibited. The Company believes that the IRS
Code Section 382 limitation did not exist as of September 30, 1998 and if
triggered the consequence is expected to have no material impact on the
Company consolidated financial position or results of operations.

11. LOSS PER SHARE
Loss per share has been calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss
applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each year. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common and
common equivalent shares if dilutive. Diluted loss per share is the same as
basic loss per share since the effect of common equivalent shares and assumed
conversion of convertible preferred stock is anti-dilutive. Following is a
reconciliation of the basic and diluted loss per share computations                                   For the Year End

In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, the chief
executive officer purchased 100,000 shares of unregistered Common Stock for a
total purchase price of $150,000 in fiscal 1998. The Company believes the
purchase price represented the fair value of unregistered Common Stock on the
dates of purchase.
In accordance with the terms of two separation agreements with senior
officers of the Company, the exercise periods of previously granted stock
options for the purchase of a total of 660,000 shares of Common Stock were
extended, resulting in a charge of $123,000 in fiscal 1998 in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.
General and administrative expense includes consulting fees and expenses in
the amount of $52,415, $112,089 and $870,000 $788,500 of which was paid in
stock paid to the Company directors for the fiscal years ended September 30,

12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS continued
In July 1997, the Company entered into a contract with a director for
consulting services in connection with a private placement of restricted Common
Stock in return for 200,000 warrants with an exercise price of $001 per share. 
Those warrants were exercised in their entirety in February 1998.
General and administrative expense includes professional fees in the amount
of $62,000, $197,623 and $122,000 paid to two stockholders of the Company for
legal and other services provided for the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively. Of these amounts, $62,000, $100,000 and $-0 respectively, were paid in Common Stock.
During fiscal 1997, two former stockholders of DarkHorse were paid $37,809
each. A third stockholder debt to the Company was reduced by $5,500 from
$17,691 to $12,191. This debt was paid in full in April 1998. Prior to the
acquisition, DarkHorse was an S-Corporation. These obligations arose at the
date of acquisition to cover the taxes on earnings passed on to the three
stockholders for the period from January 1, 1996 to the date of acquisition. 
Upon the acquisitions of 1st Tech and DarkHorse by the Company on May 21,
1996, the principal stockholder of 1st Tech who was also one of three principal
stockholders of DarkHorse became the chief operating officer of the Company
until October 1997, and was issued an aggregate of 1,995,000 shares of Common
Stock in exchange for shares of 1st Tech and DarkHorse owned by him. The
1,995,000 shares had a total value of $8,379,000 based on the closing price of
the Common Stock on May 21, 1996. This stockholder also was granted a stock
option under the Company 1993 Stock Option Plan, exercisable over a five-year
period, for the purchase of an aggregate of 150,000 shares of Common Stock at
$369 per share. The shares underlying the option vest one-third on each of the
first three anniversaries of the grant date. In connection with the
acquisitions, this stockholder was granted the right to designate two
individuals for appointment to the Company Board of Directors and to name an
advisory director.
To take advantage of an inventory purchase opportunity, the Company
requested that all outstanding stock purchase warrant holders exercise their
warrants by March 31, 1997, which was substantially prior to the scheduled
expiration dates of the warrants. As an inducement for the early exercise, the
exercise price was discounted 50%. An additional incentive was offered to stock
purchase warrant holders who funded their subscription immediately upon notice
of such request. This inducement consisted of an offer of 200,000 warrants at
an exercise price of $01 per share, prorated among the warrant holders who
funded upon notice of such request.
