REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Coinstar, Inc.: We have audited Coinstar, Inc.s the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements
report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Coinstar, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Coinstar, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated
statements of net income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated February9, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP

NOTE 2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Principles of Consolidation The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Coinstar, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and companies in which we have a controlling interest. Investments in companies of which we may have significant influence, but not
a controlling interest, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates in Financial Reporting We prepare our financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and our notes thereto. The most significant
estimates and assumptions include the:  useful lives and salvage values of our content library;  determination of goodwill impairment;  lives and recoverability of equipment and other long-lived assets;  recognition and measurement of current and long-term deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions; and
loss contingencies. It is
reasonably possible that the estimates we make may change in the future and could have a material affect on our financial statements. 
53 Table of Contents
Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents, which consist of money market funds and a certificate of deposit,
were $454 million and $416 million at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively. Our cash balances with financial institutions may exceed the deposit insurance limits. Included in our cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 were $820 million and $725 million, respectively that we identified for settling our accrued payable to our
retailer partners in relation to our Coin kiosks, which was presented in prior periods as cash being processed in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable represents receivables, net of allowances
for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on historical experience and other currently available
information. When a specific account is deemed uncollectible, the account is written off against the allowance. Certain information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows in thousands:  Dollars in thousands
Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Amount expensed for uncollectible accounts 455 272 99 Amount charged against the allowance Content Library Our content library, which we called our DVD library in prior years, consists of movies and video games available for rent or purchase. We obtain our movie and video game content through revenue sharing
agreements and license agreements with studios and game publishers, as well as through distributors and other suppliers. The content purchases are capitalized and amortized to their estimated salvage value as a component of direct operating expenses
over the usage period. The cost of content mainly includes the cost of the movies and video games, labor, overhead, freight, and studio revenue sharing expenses. Content salvage values are estimated based on the amounts that we have historically
recovered on disposal. For purchased content that we expect to be sold at the end of its useful life, an estimated salvage value is provided. For licensed content that we do not expect to sell, no salvage value is provided. The useful lives and
salvage value of our content library are periodically reviewed and evaluated. The amortization charges are recorded on an accelerated basis, reflecting higher rentals of movies and video games in the first few weeks after release, and substantially
all of the amortization expense is recognized within one year of purchase. Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Expenditures that extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the
efficiency of property and equipment are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recognized using the straight-line method over the following approximate useful lives:  Useful Life Coin-counting kiosks and components
2 to 10 years
Redbox kiosks
5 years
Computers and software
3 - 5 years
Office furniture and equipment
5 - 7 years
Leased vehicles
Lease term
Leasehold improvements
Shorter oflease term or usefullifeofimprovement
54 Table of Contents
Internal-Use Software We capitalize costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software during the application development stage. Capitalization of software development costs occurs after the preliminary project stage is
complete, management authorizes the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. We expense costs incurred for training, data conversion, and maintenance, as well as spending
in the post-implementation stage. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized only to the extent that it enables the software to perform a task it previously could not perform. The internal-use software is
included in computers and software under property and equipment in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We amortize the internal-use software based on the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. 
Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization Our intangible assets subject to amortization are comprised primarily of retailer relationships acquired in connection with our acquisitions. We used expectations of future cash flows to estimate the fair
value of the acquired retailer relationships. We amortize our intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. 
Goodwill Goodwill represents the
excess purchase price of an acquired enterprise or assets over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of November30 or whenever an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. As a result of the early adoption of Accounting Standard Update ASU No2011-08 Testing
goodwill for impairment, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we first assess a range of qualitative factors including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for our
products and services, regulatory and political developments, entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance, when evaluating potential impairment for goodwill. If, after completing such assessment, it is determined more likely
than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we proceed to a two-step impairment test, whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired and the second step of the test is not performed. The second step of the impairment test is performed when the carrying
amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, then the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value of that goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. For additional information see Note 6: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Note 4: Discontinued Operations, Sale of Assets and Assets of
Business Held for Sale. Lives and Recoverability of Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets 
We evaluate the estimated remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Factors that would indicate potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived
assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets physical condition and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. When there is an indication of impairment, we prepare an estimate of future,
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to test recoverability. If the sum of the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying value of the asset, it indicates that the long-lived
asset is not recoverable, in which case we will then compare the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset, we recognize the impairment loss and adjust the carrying amount of
the asset to its estimated fair value.

Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We
record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. 
In addition, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all
years subject to examination based upon managements evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have
recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate or effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where
it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. When applicable, associated interest and penalties have been recognized as a component of income tax expense. See
Note 11: Income Taxes. Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities 
We account for tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction i.e., sales, use, value added on a
net excluded from revenue basis. Convertible Debt In September 2009, we issued $2000 million aggregate principal amount of 4% Convertible Senior Notes the Notes. We have separately accounted for the liability and the equity
components of the Notes based on the estimated fair value of the debt upon issuance. Since none of the conversion events were met as of December31, 2011, the Notes were reported as long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
the $269 million debt conversion feature that was recorded as temporary equity at December31, 2010 was reclassified to common stock as of December31, 2011. For additional information see Note 8: Debt and Other Long-Term Liabilities.
Loss Contingencies 
We accrue estimated liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation and other sources when it is probable that a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the claim assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated. We believe that we have sufficient accruals to cover any obligations resulting from claims, assessments or litigation that have met these criteria.
Revenue Recognition 
We recognize revenue as follows:  RedboxRevenue from movie and video game rentals is recognized ratably over the term of a consumers rental transaction. Revenue from
a direct sale out of the kiosk of previously rented movies or video games is recognized at the time of sale. On rental transactions for which the related movie or video game has not yet been returned to the kiosk at month-end, revenue is recognized
with a corresponding receivable recorded in the balance sheet, net of a reserve for potentially uncollectible amounts. We record revenue, net of refunds and applicable sales taxes collected from consumers.  CoinRevenue from a coin-counting transaction, which is collected from either consumers or card issuers in stored value product
transactions, is recognized at the time the consumers coins are counted by our coin-counting kiosks. Our revenue represents the fee charged for coin-counting transactions. 
56 Table of Contents New VenturesNew Ventures revenue is recognized when the sale of product or service transaction through our new concept kiosks is
completed. Consumers either pay cash or use credit or debit cards when they purchase products or services from our New Venture segment. Our New Venture segment currently offers coffee, refurbished electronics, and photo services to our consumers.
Fees Paid to Retailers Fees paid to retailers relate to the amount we pay our retailers for the benefit of placing our kiosks in their stores and their agreement to provide certain services on our behalf to our consumers. The
fee is generally calculated as a percentage of each coin-counting transaction or as a percentage of our net movie or video game rental revenue and is recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income within the direct operating expenses.
The fee arrangements are based on our negotiations and evaluation of certain factors with the retailers such as total revenue, long-term non-cancelable contracts, installation of our kiosks in high traffic and/or urban or rural locations, co-op
marketing incentives, or other criteria. Advertising Advertising costs, which are included as a component of marketing expenses, are expensed as incurred and totaled $159 million, $154 million and $108 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Research and Development Costs incurred for research and development activities are expensed as incurred. Foreign
Currency Translation The functional currencies of our international subsidiaries are the British poundSterling for our
subsidiary Coinstar Limited in the United Kingdom, Canadian dollar for Coinstar International, and the Euro for our subsidiaries Coinstar Money Transfer and Coinstar Ireland Limited. We translate assets and liabilities related to these operations to
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheets; we convert revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are reported as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Share-Based Payments We measure and recognize expense for all share-based payment awards granted, including employee stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant
date.We utilize the Black-Scholes-Merton BSM valuation model for valuing our stock option awards and the determination of the expenses. The use of the BSM valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected
term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award.The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates at the time they are made, but these estimates involve
inherent uncertainties and the determination of expense could be materially different in the future. We amortize share-based payment expense
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the individual award with estimated forfeitures considered. Vesting periods are generally four years. Shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options will come from newly issued shares. The
expense related to restricted stock granted to movie studios as part of license agreements is adjusted based on the number of unvested shares and market price of our common stock each reporting period. 
57 Table of Contents
Share-based payment expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest.Therefore, we have
reduced the share-based payment expense to be recognized over the vesting period for anticipated future forfeitures.Forfeiture estimates are based on historical forfeiture patterns.We review and assess our forfeiture estimates quarterly
and update them if necessary. Any changes to accumulated share-based payment expense are recognized in the period of change.If actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates, our results of operations could be materially impacted.
For additional information see Note 10: Share-Based Payments.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts for cash equivalents, our receivables and our payables approximate fair value, which is the amount for which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. Our available-for-sale securities are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis. The fair value of our revolving line of credit approximates its carrying amount. For additional information
see Note 17: Fair Value. Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Current Year 
In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements. ASU 2009-13 addresses the unit of accounting for multiple-element arrangements. In addition, ASU 2009-13 revises the method by which consideration is allocated among the units of accounting. Specifically, the overall
consideration is allocated to each deliverable by establishing a selling price for individual deliverables based on a hierarchy of evidence, involving vendor-specific objective evidence, other third party evidence of the selling price, or the
reporting entitys best estimate of the selling price of individual deliverables in the arrangement. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after
June15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 in the first quarter of 2011 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. ASU 2010-06 amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 820-10 by
requiring more robust disclosures about ithe different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, iithe valuation techniques and inputs used, iiithe activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and
ivthe transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3. The disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relating to Level 3 measurements, and the new disclosures overtransfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
measurements, andactivity in Level 3 fair value measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 in the first quarter of 2011 resulted in additional disclosures included in Note
17: Fair Value and did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2010, the
FASB issued ASU 2010-28, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other: When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts. The amendments in this ASU modify Step 1 of the
goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
ASU 2010-28 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2010. The adoption of ASU 2010-28 in the first quarter of 2011 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-02, A Creditors Determination of Whether a
Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring. ASU 2011-02 amends and clarifies existing guidance for evaluating whether the restructuring of a receivable by a creditor is a troubled debt restructuring TDR and requires
certain disclosures for TDRs. ASU 2011-02 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-02 in the third quarter of 2011 did not have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
58 Table of Contents
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment.
ASU 2011-08 simplifies the goodwill impairment assessment by permitting a company to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the
two-step goodwill impairment test. If the conclusion is that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company would be required to conduct the current two-step goodwill impairment test.
Otherwise, it would not need to apply the two-step test. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted. We adopted ASU
2011-08 in the fourth quarter of 2011 in connection with our goodwill impairment assessment and it did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In May2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011-04 was issued to
achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around
valuation inputs and investment categorization. ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2011. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2011-04 in the first quarter of 2012 will have a material
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-05,
Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU 2011-05 allows an entity to have the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates
the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in
net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. ASU 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December15, 2011. In November 2011, the Board decided to defer the effective date of
certain changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. A final effective date for those changes is expected to be issued soon. While ASU 2011-05 will require us to change the manner in which we present other comprehensive
income and its components on a retrospective basis, we do not believe our adoption of ASU 2011-05 in the first quarter of 2012 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Reclassifications During the
second quarter of 2011, we consolidated our cash categories into one line item, cash and cash equivalents, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets to better align with how we manage our company. This reclassification had no effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. NOTE 3: BUSINESS COMBINATION
Redbox On
February26, 2009, we completed the purchase of the remaining 49% non-controlling interest in Redbox. The following is a summary of the consideration we paid in connection with this transaction: February26, 2009 Shares in thousands, dollars in thousands
Shares Amount Common shares 1,748 48,493 Fair value of seller financed notes the Notes 101,105 Cash 10,083

59 Table of Contents
The Notes were recorded at the estimated fair value at closing. The Notes and accrued interest of $27
million were paid during the second and third quarters of 2009. The purchase of the non-controlling interests in Redbox was a change of our
ownership interest in a previously consolidated subsidiary and was accounted for as an equity transaction. Accordingly, there was no gain or loss recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The difference between the fair value of the total
considerations and the carrying value of the non-controlling interest purchased was recognized as a reduction of equity. The amounts recorded to equity, net of tax, were as follows in thousands: February26,2009 Fair value of consideration paid less the carrying value of the non-controlling interests 112,529 Less Tax benefitreduction in equity 43,886 Tax benefitsection 754 election 12,340

NOTE 4: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, SALE OF ASSETS AND ASSETS OF BUSINESS HELD FOR SALE
Money Transfer Business the Money Transfer Business On June9, 2011, we completed the sale transaction of the Money Transfer Business to Sigue Corporation Sigue. We received $195 million in cash and a note receivable of $295 million
the Sigue Note. In December 2011, as part of the sale transaction, we were required to provide Sigue with an additional loan of $40 million under terms consistent with the Sigue Note. See Note 17: Fair Value for additional
details about the Sigue Note. We estimated the fair value of the Sigue Note at approximately $244 million, which was based on the discounted
cash flows of the future note payments and was not an exit price based measure of fair value or the stated value on the face of the Sigue Note. The discount rate used in our fair value estimate was the market rate for similar risk profile companies
and represented our best estimate of default risk. During 2011, we recognized $19 million of interest income base on the imputed interest rate of the Sigue Note and received $13 million in interest payments from Sigue based on the nominal interest
rate of the Sigue note. On June9, 2011, the sold assets and liabilities of the Money Transfer Business primarily consisted of the
following in thousands:  Dollars in thousands

60 Table of Contents
The net assets disposed represent the fair value less cost to sell the Money Transfer Business. The loss on
disposal activities recognized in 2011 and 2010 was allocated to the asset disposal group including property, plant and equipment, net, intangible and other assets. During the second quarter of 2010, the Money Transfer Business asset group met accounting requirements to be presented as assets held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and a discontinued
operation in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The business assets and liabilities held for sale were reported based on their estimated fair value less cost to sell estimated using the market approach. The carrying value of the
assets and liabilities exceeded the estimated fair value less cost to sell thereby failing step one of our impairment test. Upon conducting step two of the impairment test, the implied goodwill of the Money Transfer Business exceeded the carrying
value of its goodwill resulting in no goodwill impairment. We performed our goodwill impairment test each quarter thereafter until disposition. During 2010, there was no goodwill impairment. In 2009, the Money Transfer Business failed our goodwill
impairment test, which resulted in a charge of $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, which is included within income loss from discontinued operations, net of tax on our Consolidated Statements of Net Income for 2009. 
Electronic Payment Business the E-Pay Business On May25, 2010, we sold our subsidiaries comprising the E-Pay Business to InComm Holdings, Inc. and InComm Europe Limited collectively InComm for an aggregate purchase price of $400
million. In addition, the purchase price was subject to a post-closing net working capital adjustment in the amount of $05 million, which was finalized in October 2010. The disposed assets and liabilities consisted of the following:  Dollars in thousands

Entertainment Business On September8, 2009, we sold our subsidiaries comprising our Entertainment Business to National Entertainment Network, Inc. National for nominal consideration. With the transaction,
National assumed the operations of the Entertainment Business, including substantially all of the Entertainment Businesss related assets and liabilities. The disposed assets and liabilities consisted of the following:  Dollars in thousands

There were no changes to our goodwill balance during 2011 or 2010. 
We qualitatively assessed goodwill for impairment on November30, 2011, and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of
each of our reporting units was less than its applicable carrying value. Accordingly, it was not necessary to perform the two-step impairment test and no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2011. 
During 2010, after performing step one of our goodwill impairment test using the income and market approach to determine the estimated fair value of our
Redbox and Coin reporting units, we determined that there was no goodwill impairment. Additionally, during 2010, the goodwill of $77 million related to our Money Transfer business was reclassified to assets of businesses held for sale on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and was subsequently disposed of upon the close of the sale transaction in 2011.

Revolving Line of Credit and Term Loan On July15, 2011, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement the New Credit Facility, providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility and a senior secured
term loan facility, which replaced our prior credit facility, which consisted of a revolving line of credit. The New Credit Facility provides for a five-year, $1750 million term loan and a $4500 million revolving line of credit. Subject to
additional commitments from lenders, we have the option to increase the aggregate facility size by $2500 million, which can be comprised of additional term loans and a revolving line of credit. On July15, 2011, we borrowed $1750million
under the term loan facility, a portion of which was utilized to pay down the revolving line of credit balance under the prior credit facility of $1200 million. Fees paid for the New Credit Facility of $42million were included within other
long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized over the 5-year life of the New Credit Facility. In addition, $09 million of unamortized deferred finance fees related to the prior credit facility were carried over
to the new revolving credit facility arrangement. Deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method. The New Credit Facility matures on July15, 2016, at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid. The term loan is subject to mandatory debt repayments of the outstanding borrowings equal to
5% in the first year, 75% in the second year, 10% in the third year, and 125% in the fourth and fifth year, with the balance due at maturity. In 2011, we made principal payments of $44 million on the term loan. Our obligations under the New
Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries, as well as a pledge of a substantial portion of our subsidiaries capital stock. 
Subject to applicable conditions, we may elect interest rates on our revolving borrowings calculated by reference to ithe British Bankers

The New Credit Facility contains standard negative covenants and restrictions on actions including, without
limitation, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes or dispositions of our assets, payments of dividends, capital expenditures, investments, and mergers, dispositions and acquisitions, among other restrictions. In addition, the New
Credit Facility requires that we meet certain financial covenants, ratios and tests, including maintaining a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Facility. As of
December31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants of the New Credit Facility. Convertible Debt 
The aggregate outstanding principal of our 40% Convertible Senior Notes the Notes is $2000 million. The Notes bear interest at a fixed
rate of 4%per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each March1 and September1, and mature on September1, 2014. The effective interest rate at issuance was 85%. As of December31, 2011, we were in compliance with
all covenants. The Notes become convertible the Conversion Event when the closing price of our common stock exceeds $5238,
130% of the Notes conversion price, for more than 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days prior to each quarter-end date. If the Notes become convertible and should the Note holders elect to convert, we will be required to pay
them up to the full face value of the Notes in cash as well as deliver shares of our common stock for any excess conversion value. The number of potentially issued shares increases as the market price of our common stock increases. As of
December31, 2011, the Conversion Event was not met and the Notes remained classified as a long-term liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, since the Notes were not convertible at December31, 2011, the $269
million debt conversion feature that was classified as temporary equity at December31, 2010 was reclassified to common stock as of December31, 2011. The following interest expense was recorded related to the Notes:  Dollars in thousands

Redbox Rollout Agreement In November 2006, our Redbox subsidiary and McDonalds USA entered into a Rollout Purchase, License and Service Agreement the Rollout Agreement giving McDonalds USA and its
franchisees and franchise marketing cooperatives the right to purchase DVD rental kiosks to be located at selected McDonalds restaurant sites for which Redbox subsequently received proceeds. The proceeds under the Rollout Agreement are
classified as debt and the interest rate is based on similar rates that Redbox has with its kiosk sale-leaseback transactions.

The payments made to McDonalds USA over the contractual term of the Rollout Agreement will reduce the accrued interest liability and principal. The future payments made under this Rollout
Agreement contain a minimum annual payment as well as the variable payouts based on the license fee earned by McDonalds USA and its franchisees through the term of the agreement. The following is the summary in relation to the rollout

Share-Based Compensation Stock options Shares of common stock are issued upon exercise of stock options. Certain
other information regarding our stock-based awards is as follows:  Beginning in February 2010, stock options are granted only to our executives and non-employee directors.  Options granted after February 2010 vest annually in equal installments over 4 years, and expire after 10 years.  Prior to February 2010, options granted to our executives and employees vest annually in equal installments over 4 years and expire after either 5 or
10 years, depending on the grant date; options granted to our non-employee directors vest in equal monthly installments and expire after 5 years. The following table summarizes the weighted average valuation assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Valuation model for stock options granted: YearEndedDecember31 2011 2010 2009 Expected term in years 73 73 37 Expected stock price volatility 43 43 40 Risk-free interest rate 28 24 16 Expected dividend-yield 00 00 00  The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time from grant until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar

vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. The increase of the expected term assumption during 2010 was due to an increase in the contractual term of options granted to our
executives beginning February 2010 as compared to prior periods.  Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock for a period at least equal to the expected term.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent expected term.
We have not paid dividends in the past and do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Restricted stock awards Restricted stock awards are granted to eligible employees, including executives, and non-employee directors. Awards granted to employees and executives vest annually in equal installments over four years.
Non-employee director awards vest one year after the grant date. Performance-based restricted stock awards are granted to executives only, with established performance criteria approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, once
earned, and vest in equal installments over three years from the date of grant. The restricted shares require no payment from the grantee. The fair value of the awards is based on the market price on the grant date and is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period or based on achieving performance conditions. The following table presents a summary of

Share-Based Payments for Content Arrangements 
We granted restricted stock as part of content license agreements with certain movie studios. The expense related to these agreements is included within
direct operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income and is adjusted based on the number of unvested shares and market price of our common stock each reporting period. During 2010 and 2009, we entered into agreements with
SPHE Scan Based Trading Corporation Sony and Paramount Home Entertainment, Inc. Paramount. During the third
quarter of 2011, our agreement with Sony was amended whereby: ithe scheduled vesting of certain shares of restricted stock was extended from August1, 2011 to August1, 2012; and iithe number of weeks we can offer Sony
content in our kiosks was extended from 26 weeks to 52 weeks. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we entered into an amendment to the revenue
sharing license agreement with Paramount, which provided, among other things, that: iParamount waived its current termination right to end the licensing arrangement at the end of 2011; iiParamount receives, at its sole discretion,
the option for two, one-year extensions following the initial five-year agreement term, which ends at the end of 2014 each exercised extension would provide for a grant of 50,000 shares of restricted stock vesting at the beginning of each
extension; iiithe content license period was extended from 26 weeks to 52 weeks; and ivParamount was granted 100,000 shares of restricted stock which will vest according to the vesting schedule of the current restricted stock
purchase agreement with Paramount. Information related to the shares of restricted stock granted as part of these agreements as of

At December31, 2011, the unrecognized tax benefits were primarily related to RD credit and income/expense
recognition, all of which would have an effect on our effective tax rate if recognized. It was not necessary to accrue interest and penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions identified because operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards were sufficient to offset all unrecognized tax benefits.

Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the carrying
amounts used for income tax purposes. Future tax benefits for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are also recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. 
In determining our tax provisions, management determined the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax jurisdiction and considered a
number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets. As of December31,
2011, a valuation allowance was not necessary as positive evidence outweighed negative evidence that those deferred tax assets were more likely than not be realized. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the net increase decrease in the valuation allowance were as follows:  Dollars in thousands

Based upon our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, we
believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances at December31, 2011. U.S. Federal Tax Credits and Expiration Periods The following is the information

We did not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign operations because they were considered
permanently invested outside of the U.S. Upon repatriation, some of these earnings would generate foreign tax credits, which may reduce the U.S. tax liability associated with any future foreign dividend. At December31, 2011, the cumulative
amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $126 million. Income Tax Benefit from Stock

NOTE 14:BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE INFORMATION 
Management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is our CEO, evaluates the performances of our business segments primarily on segment revenue
and segment operating income from continuing operations before depreciation, amortization and other, and share-based compensation granted to executives, non-employee directors and employees segment operating income. Segment operating
income contains internally allocated costs of our shared service support functions, including corporate executive management, business development, sales, finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and risk management. We also review
depreciation and amortization allocated to each segment. Shared-based payments expense related to share-based compensation granted to executives, non-employee directors and employees is not allocated to our segments and is included in the corporate
unallocated column in the analysis and reconciliation below; however, share-based payments expense related to our content arrangements with certain movie studios has been allocated to our Redbox segment and is included within direct operating
expenses. Our performance evaluation does not include segment assets. Changes in our Organizational Structure 
During the first quarter of 2011, in addition to our existing segments, Redbox and Coin, we added a third reportable segment, New Ventures, to reflect
changes in how our CEO manages our businesses and allocates 
75 Table of Contents
resources for the future growth of the Company. Our New Ventures segment consists primarily of our coffee self-service concept as well as other self-service concepts including refurbished
electronics and photo services. As part of our new reporting structure, during the second quarter of 2011, we completed our evaluation of the
reassignment of goodwill to our New Ventures segment by using a relative fair value approach that is similar to the approach used when a portion of a segment is to be disposed. We used both the income and cost methods to estimate the fair value of
our New Ventures segment and both the income and market methods to estimate the fair values of our Redbox and Coin segments. As a result of our evaluation, we did not assign any goodwill to our New Ventures segment because the amount was immaterial.
During the second quarter of 2011, we exited one of the self-service concepts we were testing, which was included in our New Ventures
segment. Based on our materiality assessment, we consider the results of the exited self-service concept to be immaterial and therefore have elected not to present it as a discontinued operation in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income.
Comparability of Segment Results We have recast prior period results as presented below for the following:  The addition of our New Ventures segment, which includes our self-service concepts, which were part of our Coin and Redbox segments prior to the first
quarter of 2011; and  The allocation of share-based payments made to certain movie studios as part of content agreements from corporate unallocated expenses to direct
operating expenses in our Redbox segment beginning in the first quarter of 2011. Our analysis and reconciliation of our
segment information to the consolidated financial statements that follows covers our results from continuing operations, which consists of our Redbox, Coin and New Ventures segments. Unallocated general and administrative expenses relate to
share-based compensation.  In thousands Year Ended December31, 2011

NOTE 15:RETIREMENT PLANS We sponsor a defined contribution plan for our employees who satisfy certain age and service requirements. Our Redbox subsidiary also sponsors a defined contribution plan to which new contributions were
frozen effective January1, 2010. Our contributions to these plans were $32 million, $28 million and $19 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. NOTE 16:DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
Interest Rate Swaps Our interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank to hedge against the variable-rate interest payments on our revolving credit facility expired on March20, 2011. As of December31, 2011,
we had no interest rate swaps outstanding that were accounted for as cash flow hedges. The fair value of the interest rate swap as of
December31, 2010 was a liability of $896,000, which was reversed from comprehensive income and recognized as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income in the first quarter of 2011.

NOTE 17:FAIR VALUE Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs:  Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
78 Table of Contents Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or  Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions. 
The factors or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured and Reported at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
on a recurring basis, by level within the fair value hierarchy in thousands:  Fair Value at December31, 2011
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Money market funds and certificates of deposit 45,363 Fair Value at December31, 2010
Level 1 Level2 Level 3 Money market funds and certificates of deposit 41,598 Interest rate swap liability 896 Assets held for sale, net of liabilities held for sale 43,634
Money Market Funds and Certificates of Deposit We determine fair value for our money market funds and certificates of deposit based on quoted market prices. The fair value of these assets is included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Interest Rate Swap Liability We used a market valuation approach to value our interest rate swap derivative contracts using current market information as of the reporting date, such as the forecast of future market interest rates and
implied volatility. We mitigated derivative credit risk by transacting with highly rated counterparties. Our interest rate swap agreement for our old credit facility expired in 2011. Assets Held For Sale We used a market valuation approach to estimate the fair value of the
Money Transfer Business, which we sold to Sigue in 2011. The estimated fair value of assets held for sale in the table above excluded the costs to sell of $20 million. There were no changes to our valuation techniques in 2011. Assets and Liabilities Measured
and Reported at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis We recognize or disclose the fair value of certain assets such as notes receivable
and non-financial assets, primarily long-lived assets, goodwill, intangible assets and certain other assets in connection with impairment evaluations. All of our nonrecurring valuations use significant unobservable inputs and therefore fall under
Level3 of the fair value hierarchy. Notes Receivable During the second quarter of 2011, we financed a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our Money Transfer Business through a note receivable with Sigue the Sigue Note. During the fourth
quarter of 2011, as part of 
79 Table of Contents
the sale transaction, we were required to provide an additional loan of $40 million which was added to the balance of the Sigue Note. We estimate the fair value of the Sigue Note based on the
future note payments discounted at a market rate for similar risk profile companies, which represented our best estimate of default risk, and was not an exit price based measure of fair value or the stated value on the face of the Sigue Note. The
estimated fair value of the Sigue Note at December31, 2011 was $244 million. We have reported the estimated fair value of the Sigue Note in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We evaluate the Sigue Note for collectability on a quarterly
basis. Based on our evaluation at December31, 2011, an allowance for credit losses was not established. We recognize interest income on the Sigue Note on an accrual basis unless it is determined that collection of all principal and interest is
unlikely. See Note 4: Discontinued Operations, Sale of Assets and Assets of Business Held for Sale for additional information about the sale of our Money Transfer Business. Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets During the second quarter of 2011,
we performed nonrecurring fair value measurements in connection with assigning goodwill to our segments. See Note 11: Business Segments and Enterprise-Wide Information for additional information. 
Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The carrying value of our cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and our revolving line of credit approximate their respective fair values due to their short-term nature. 
We estimate the fair value of our convertible debt outstanding using the market rate for similar high-yield debt. The estimated fair value of our
convertible debt was $1834 million and $1809 million at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010, respectively, and was determined based on its stated terms, maturing on September1, 2014 and an annual interest rate of 4%. We have
reported the carrying value of our convertible debt, face value less the unamortized debt discount, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
NOTE 18:COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments Operating Leases 
We lease our corporate administrative, marketing, and product development facility in Bellevue, Washington under operating leases that expire
December31, 2019. We lease our Redbox facility in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois under an operating lease that expires on July31,
2021. Under certain circumstances, we have the ability to extend the lease for a five-year period, rent additional office space under a right of first offer and refusal and have the option to terminate the lease in July 2016. Under the terms of the
lease, we are responsible for certain tax, construction and operating costs associated with the rented space. Rent expense under our
operating lease agreements was $89 million, $83 million and $60 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital Leases
We lease automobiles and computer equipment under capital leases expiring at various dates through 2019. In most circumstances, we expect
that, in the normal course of business, these leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. During 2009, we entered into a
sales-leaseback transaction in which we sold certain kiosks and leased them back for the same amount as the sales proceeds. The transaction was considered a financing arrangement and 
80 Table of Contents
accounted for as a capital lease such that the kiosks remain on our books and continue to be depreciated. Our obligation related to the transaction was $48 million and $197 million at
December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Assets held under capital leases are included in property and equipment, net on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets and include the following:  Dollars in thousands

Letters of Credit As of December31, 2011, we had four irrevocable standby letters of credit that totaled $55 million. These standby letters of credit, which expire at various times through 2012, are used to
collateralize certain obligations to third parties. As of December31, 2011, no amounts were outstanding under these standby letter of credit agreements. Legal Matters In October 2009, an Illinois resident, Laurie Piechur, individually
and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint against our Redbox subsidiary in the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit, St. Clair County, Illinois.The plaintiff alleges that, among other
things, Redbox charges consumers illegal and excessive late fees in violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act, and that Redboxs rental terms violate the Illinois Rental Purchase Agreement Act or the Illinois
Automatic Contract Renewal Act and the plaintiff is seeking monetary damages and other relief.In November 2009, Redbox removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. In February 2010, the District Court
remanded the case to the Circuit Court for the Twentieth Judicial Circuit, St. Clair County, Illinois. In May 2010, the court denied Redboxs motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims, and also denied the plaintiffs motion for partial
summary judgment. In November 2011, the plaintiff moved for class certification, and Redbox moved for summary judgment. We believe that the claims against us are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Currently, no
accrual has been established as it was not possible to estimate the possible loss or range of loss because this matter had not advanced to a stage where we could make any such estimate. 
82 Table of Contents
On January24, 2011, a putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Washington against Coinstar and certain of its officers. The complaint asserts claims under Sections10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Five
substantially similar complaints were later filed in the same court.Pursuant to an order of the court dated March14, 2011, these six putative class actions were consolidated as a single action entitled In re Coinstar, Inc. Securities
Litigation.On April19, 2011, the court appointed the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island as lead plaintiff and approved its selection of lead counsel. A consolidated complaint was filed on June17, 2011. We moved to
dismiss this complaint on July15, 2011. On October6, 2011, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss. The order dismissed numerous allegations, including allegations that our October28,
2010 revenue and earnings guidance was false and misleading. The order also dismissed all claims against three of our officers.The court has set a trial date for September9, 2013. This case purports to be brought on behalf of a class of
persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our stock during the period from October28, 2010 to February3, 2011. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the federal securities laws during this period of time by, among other
things, issuing false and misleading statements about our current and prospective business and financial results. Plaintiffs claim that, as a result of these alleged wrongs, our stock price was artificially inflated during the purported class
period. Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages, interest, an award of attorneys fees and costs, and injunctive relief. On January11, 2012, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the other parties to settle
and resolve the class action.The settlement provides for a payment to the plaintiff class of $60 million which will be paid by our insurers.The parties are currently working on a stipulation of settlement that will be filed with the
Court in February 2012.The class action settlement is subject to preliminary and, following notice to class members, final approval by the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. We have recorded the expected
settlement amount and corresponding insurance recovery within other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Related to this putative class action complaint, on March2 and 10, 2011, shareholder derivative actions were filed in the Superior Court of the State of Washington King County on March, allegedly
on behalf of and for the benefit of Coinstar, against certain of its current and former directors and officers.Coinstar was named as a nominal defendant. On April12, 2011, the court consolidated these actions as a single action entitled
In re Coinstar, Inc. Derivative Litigation. A third substantially similar complaint was later filed in the same court. On April18, 2011, two purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington. On May26, 2011, the court consolidated the federal derivative actions and joined them with the securities class actions, captioned In re Coinstar Securities Litigation, for pre-trial proceedings. The derivative
plaintiffs consolidated complaint was filed on July15, 2011. We moved to dismiss this complaint on August12, 2011 on the ground that the plaintiffs had not made a pre-litigation demand on our Board of Directors and had not
demonstrated that such a demand would have been futile. On November14, 2011, the court granted our motion and issued an order dismissing the complaint with leave to amend the compliant. On November23, 2011, plaintiffs moved to stay the
action or defer filing of an amended complaint in order to allow them time to inspect Coinstars books and records prior to any such amendment. On December22, 2011, the court entered an order granting in part and denying in part
plaintiffs motion. The order grants plaintiffs request to defer filing of an amended complaint until February23, 2012, but provided that if plaintiffs choose to file an amended complaint, they must pay attorneys fees incurred
by defendants on the motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. The state and federal derivative complaints arise out of many of the factual allegations at issue in the class action, and generally allege that the individual defendants breached
fiduciary duties owed to Coinstar by selling Coinstar stock while in possession of material non-public information, and participating in or failing to prevent misrepresentations regarding Redbox expectations, performance, and internal controls. The
complaints seek unspecified damages and equitable relief, disgorgement of compensation, attorneys fees, costs, and expenses.Because the complaints are derivative in nature, they do not seek monetary damages from Coinstar. 
In March 2011, a California resident, Blake Boesky, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint
against our Redbox subsidiary in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff alleges that Redbox retains personally identifiable information of consumers for 
83 Table of Contents
a time period in excess of that allowed under the Video Privacy Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. 2710, et seq.A substantially similar complaint was filed in the same court in March
2011 by an Illinois resident, Kevin Sterk.Since the filing of the complaint, Blake Boesky has been replaced by a different named plaintiff, Jiah Chung, and an amended complaint has been filed alleging disclosures of personally identifiable
information, in addition to plaintiffs claims of retention of such information.Plaintiffs are seeking statutory damages, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs of suit, and interest. The court has consolidated the cases.The
court has denied Redboxs motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims involving retention of information, and is still considering Redboxs motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims involving disclosure of information. We believe that
the claims against us are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Currently, no accrual has been established as it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or range of loss because this matter had not advanced to
a stage where we could make any such estimate. In February 2011, a California resident, Michael Mehrens, individually and on behalf of all
others similarly situated, filed a putative class action complaint against our Redbox subsidiary in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff alleges that, among other things, Redbox violated
Californias Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971 Song-Beverly with respect to the collection and recording of consumer personal identification information, and violated the California Business and Professions Code 17200
based on the alleged violation of Song-Beverly.A similar complaint alleging violations of Song-Beverly and the right to privacy generally was filed in March 2011 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda, by a
California resident, John Sinibaldi. A third similar complaint alleging only a violation of Song-Beverly, was filed in March 2011 in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego, by a California resident, Richard
Schiff.Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory damages and civil penalties, injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs of suit, and interest. Redbox removed the Mehrens case to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California,
the Sinibaldi case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, and the Schiff case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The Sinibaldi case was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the Central District of California, where the Mehrens case is pending, and these two cases have been consolidated. At the same time, the plaintiffs substituted Nicolle DiSimone as the named plaintiff in the Mehrens case. After Redbox filed a
motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer, the Schiff case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California but has not been consolidated with the Mehrens case. Redbox moved to dismiss the DiSimone/Sinibaldi case, and
DiSimone/Sinibaldi moved for class certification. In January 2012, the Court granted Redboxs motion to dismiss with prejudice and denied DiSimone/Sinibaldis motion for class certification as moot. Plaintiffs have until February 2012 to
appeal. We believe that the claims against us are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Currently, no accrual has been established as it is not possible to estimate the possible loss or range of loss because this
matter had not advanced to a stage where we could make any such estimate. Other Contingencies 
In 2011, we recorded a loss contingency in the amount of $116 million related to a supply agreement under which we operated during 2011 and 2010 in our
Consolidated Statements of Net Income. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we made payments totaling $75 million to the supplier. Based on currently available information, our best estimate of the aggregate range for reasonably possible
losses, including the $75 million of payments made in the fourth quarter of 2011, is from $75 million to $116 million. As of December31, 2011, the amount accrued within other accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was
$41 million. We believe the likelihood of additional losses material to our accrual as of December
31, 2011 is remote. NOTE 19: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Joint Venture On February3, 2012, Redbox and Verizon Ventures IV LLC
Verizon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Verizon Communications Inc., entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement the LLC Agreement and related 
84 Table of Contents
arrangements. The LLC Agreement governs the relationship of the parties with respect to a joint venture the Joint Venture formed for the primary purpose of developing, launching,
marketing and operating a nationwide over-the-top video distribution services providing consumers with access to video programming content, including linear content, delivered via broadband networks to video-enabled viewing devices and
offering rental of physical DVDs and Blu-ray Discs from Redbox kiosks. Redbox is initially acquiring a 350%
ownership interest in the Joint Venture and will make an initial capital contribution of $140 million in cash. The Joint Venture board may request each member to make additional capital contributions, on a pro rata basis relative to its respective
ownership interest. If a member does not make any or all of its requested capital contributions, as the case may be, the other contributing member generally may make such capital contributions. So long as Redbox contributes its pro rata share of the
first $4500 million of capital contributions to the Joint Venture, Redboxs interest cannot be diluted below 100%. In addition, Redbox has certain rights to cause Verizon to acquire Redboxs interest in the Joint Venture generally
following the fifth anniversary of the LLC Agreement or in limited circumstances, at an earlier period of time and Verizon has certain rights to acquire Redboxs interest in the Joint Venture generally following the seventh anniversary of the
LLC Agreement, or, in limited circumstances, the fifth anniversary of the LLC Agreement. Redboxs ownership interest in the Joint Venture will be accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
Acquisition of NCR Entertainment Business On February3, 2012, Redbox entered into a purchase agreement with NCR Corporation NCR the NCR Agreement, to acquire certain assets of NCR related to NCRs
self-service entertainment DVD kiosk business. The purchased assets include, among others, self-service DVD kiosks, DVD inventory, intellectual property, and certain related contracts. The purchase price includes a $1000 million cash payment, as
adjusted if certain contracts are not transferred at closing, and the assumption of certain liabilities of NCR related to the purchased assets. We expect the transaction will be recorded as a business combination. Closing of the transaction is
subject to certain customary closing conditions, including appropriate governmental approval under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, as amended HSR. If the NCR Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances
relating to failure to obtain appropriate antitrust approvals, Redbox is required to pay NCR a $100 million break fee within five days of such termination. In addition, in connection with the NCR Agreement, we intend to enter into a strategic
arrangement with NCR for manufacturing and services during the five-year period post-closing. At the end of the five-year period, if the aggregate amount paid in margin to NCR for manufacturing and services delivered equaled less than $250 million,
we would pay NCR the difference between such aggregate amount and $250 million. Assuming HSR approval, we expect the transaction to close no later than the third quarter of 2012. Item 1.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a set of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and has determined
that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
We also maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
85 Table of Contents
15d-15f of the Exchange Act. Certain functions of our enterprise resource planning ERP system implementation were completed during the fourth quarter of 2011. As a result, there
were changes to processes and procedures that impacted internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2011. Management believes the changes to the internal controls related to financial reporting for the affected processes
and procedures are adequate and effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2011 as required by the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15c. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011.
