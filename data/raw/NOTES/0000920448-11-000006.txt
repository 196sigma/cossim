Accordingly, we express no such opinion.An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and schedule.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BroadVision, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles.

The accompanying Notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements  22 Table of Contents BROADVISION,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business BroadVision,Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, BroadVision or we was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May13, 1993 and has been a publicly traded corporation since 1996. We develop, market, and support enterprise portal applications that enable companies to unify their e-business infrastructure and conduct both interactions and transactions with employees, partners, and customers through a personalized self-service model that increases revenues, reduces costs, and improves productivity. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our and our subsidiaries accounts. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates, including those related to receivable reserves, stock-based compensation, investments, income taxes and restructuring, as well as contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Overview Our revenue consists of fees for licenses of our software products, maintenance, consulting services and customer training. We generally charge fees for licenses of our software products either based on the number of personsusing the product or based on the number of CPUs on which the product is installed. Licenses for software for which fees are charged based upon the number of persons using the product include licenses for development use and licenses for use by registered users of the customer website deployment use. Licenses for software for which fees are charged on a per-CPU basis differentiate between development and deployment usage. Our revenue recognition policies comply with Accounting Standards CodificationASC 985-605, Software: Revenue Recognition ASC 985-605 and Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB 104, Revenue Recognition SAB 104. We apply the separation criteria in ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Element Arrangements ASC 605-25, to determine whether our arrangements with multiple deliverables should be treated as separate units of accounting. ASC 985-605 indicates that revenue recognized for any multiple-element contract is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element. The determination of the fair value of each element is based on our analysis of objective evidence from comparable sales of the individual element. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. For the fixed or not to exceed fees contracts, revenues are recognized based on ASC 605-35, Revenue Recognition: Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts ASC 605-35.We estimate the proportional performance on contracts on a basis of utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project. Software License Revenue We license our products through our direct sales force and indirectly through resellers and Application Service Providers ASP. In general, software license revenues are recognized when a non-cancelable license agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay, the software product has been delivered, there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier. In the case of electronic delivery, delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs. For products that cannot be used without a licensing key, the delivery requirement is met when the licensing key is made available to the customer. If collectability is not reasonably assured, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. Subscription-based license revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period. We enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of list prices. We do not grant resellers the right of return. We recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of ASC 985-605. Revenues recognized from multiple-element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements, such as licenses for software products, maintenance, consulting services or customer training. The determination of fair value is based on vendor-specific objective evidence, which is specific to us. We limit our assessment of objective evidence for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately. If evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue.We have not yet adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2009-13 an update to ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Element Arrangements ASU 2009-13.We will apply ASU 2009-13 on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on or after January 1, 2011.We have not yet determined the effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements if any, upon the adoption of ASU 2009-13. We record unearned revenue for software license agreements when cash has been received from the customer and the agreement does not qualify for revenue recognition under our revenue recognition policy. We record accounts receivable for software license agreements when the agreement qualifies for revenue recognition but cash or other consideration has not been received from the customer.  23 Table of Contents Services Revenue Consulting services revenues and customer training revenues are recognized as such services are performed. Maintenance revenues, which include revenues bundled with software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to our products, are deferred and recognized ratably over the related agreement period, generally twelve months. Our consulting services, which consist of consulting, maintenance and training, are delivered through Worldwide E-Business Solution Organization WebSo. The services that we provide are not essential to the functionality of the software. We record reimbursement from our customers for out-of-pocket expenses as an increase to services revenues. Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Short-term Investments We consider all debt and equity securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Short-term investments consist of debt and equity securities that have a remaining maturity of less than one year as of the date of the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents that serve as collateral for financial instruments such as letters of credit are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash in which the underlying instrument has a term of greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified as non-current. At December 31, 2010, a letter of credit of $10 million secured by an equal amount of restricted cash is available to the landlord securing certain facilities leases as more fully described in Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management determines the appropriate classification of short-term investments at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. All short-term investments to date have been classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair market value,on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our short-term investments contractual maturities occurbefore November 2011.Total realized gains during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were $404,000 and $720,000, respectively, and are included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments consisted of the following as of December31, 2010 and 2009 in thousands:

Research and Development and Software Development Costs ASC 985-20, Cost of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed ASC 985-20, requires capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on our product development process, technological feasibility is established upon the completion of a working model. To date, costs incurred by us from the completion of the working model to the point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant. Accordingly, we have charged all such costs to research and development expense in the period incurred. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense, which is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, amounted to $20,000 and $45,000 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  24 Table of Contents Prepaid Royalties Prepaid royalties relating to purchased software to be incorporated and sold with our software products are amortized as a cost of software licenses either on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the royalty agreement or on the basis of projected product revenues, whichever results in greater amortization. Receivable Reserves Occasionally, our customers experience financial difficulty after we record the revenue but before payment has been received. We maintain receivable reserves for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our normal payment terms are generally 30 to 90days from the invoice date. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make the contractual payments, additional reserves may be required. Losses from customer receivables in the two-year period ended December 31, 2010, have not been significant. If all efforts to collect a receivable fail, and the receivable is considered uncollectible, such receivable would be written off against the receivable reserve. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with high-quality institutions. Our management performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and requires certain of these customers to provide security deposits or letters of credit. Cash deposits and cash equivalents in foreign countries of approximately $68 million and $61 million on December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the United States. As part of our cash and investment management processes, we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. From time to time, our financial instruments maintained in our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to political risks or instability that may arise in foreign countries where we operate. At December 31, 2010, two customers in the foreign travel and online mobile service industry, respectively, accounted for 10% of our accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2009, one customer in the medical device industry accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance. For the year ended December31, 2010, no customer accounted for 10% of our total revenues.For the years ended December 31, 2009, one customer in the retail industry accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. Restructuring Through December31, 2010, we have approved certain restructuring plans to, among other things, reduce our workforce and consolidate facilities. Restructuring and asset impairment charges were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization. Our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of: 1lease termination costs and/or costs associated with permanently vacating and sub-leasing our facilities; and 2other incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. We account for each of these costs in accordance with ASC 420-10, Exit or Disposal of Cost Obligations ASC 420-10. We record the costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to us. We record the liability associated with lease termination and/or abandonment as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs, less probable sublease income. Under ASC 420-10, we record a liability for lease termination and/or abandonment cost initially at fair value on the cease-use date of that facility. Inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring.In determining the charge related to the restructuring, the majority of estimates made by management were related to the charge for excess facilities. In determining the charge for excess facilities, we were required to estimate future sublease income, future net operating expenses of the facilities, and brokerage commissions, among other expenses. The most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income that may reduce our lease obligations. We based our estimates of sublease income, in part, current market conditions and rental rates, an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made, the status of negotiations with potential subtenants, and the location of the respective facility, among other factors. We have recorded restructuring charges at the low-end of a range of assumptions modeled for restructuring charges. Adjustments to the facilities accrual will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected. We will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and, if appropriate, record changes to our restructuring obligations in current operations based on management most current estimates. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives generally two years for software, three years for computer equipment and four years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations in the period realized.  25 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement ASC 820-10.ASC 820-10 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements by establishing a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1 measurements and lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below  Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. We measurethe following financial assets at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of these financial assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 in thousandswereas follows

Level 2 securities are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments, nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data, or discounted cash flow techniques.There have been $119 million of transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 measurements.Our maturing bond holdings were not renewed due to the low corporate coupon rate for corporate bonds during the year ended December31, 2010 and were thus converted back to cash. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable for all periods presented approximates their respective carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these balances.  26 Table of Contents Employee Benefit Plans Amended and Restated 2006 Equity Incentive Plan: At our 2006 annual meeting held on August 8, 2006, our stockholders approved the adoption of our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Plan. At that time, our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the Prior Equity Plan was terminated and replaced by the Equity Plan. On January 21, 2009, our Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated BroadVision, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan the Amended and Restated Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders on April 30, 2009.The Amended and Restated Plan includes an evergreen provision that provides for automatic annual increases in the number of shares authorized for issuance.As of December 31, 2010, we had 570,625 shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under the plan.In addition, the number of shares of our Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan will automatically increase on January 1st of each year for a period of ten 10 years, commencing on January 1, 2010 and ending on and including January 1, 2019. Further, our Board of Directors may grant incentive or nonqualified stock options at prices not less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock, as determined by the Board of Directors, at the date of grant. The vesting of individual options may vary but in each case at least 20% of the total number of shares subject to vesting will become exercisable per year. These options generally expire ten years after the grant date. When an employee option is exercised prior to vesting, any unvested shares so purchased are subject to repurchase by us at the original purchase price of the stock upon termination of employment. Our right to repurchase lapses at a minimum rate of 20% per year over five years from the date the option was granted or, for new employees, the date of hire. Such right is exercisable only within 90 days following termination of employment. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, no shares were repurchased since no options were exercised prior to vesting. 2000 Non-Officer Plan: In February 2000, we adopted our 2000 Non-Officer Plan under which 106,666 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to selected employees, consultants, and our affiliates who are not Officers or Directors. As of December 31, 2010, we had 53,295 shares available for issuance under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan. Under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan, we may grant non-statutory stock options at prices not less than 85% of the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Options granted under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan generally vest over two years and are exercisable for not more than ten years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan: We also have a compensatory Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan that enables employees to purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of our common stock at a discount from the market price of the stock at the time of purchase. The Board of Directors has authorized sequential one-year offerings beginning on July 1 of each year and extending until June 30 of the following year.Commencing on the first day of the fiscal year that begins on January 1, 2004 and ending on and including the first day of the fiscal year that begins on January 1, 2014 each such day, a Calculation Date, our Purchase Plan reserved shares can be increased by a number equal to the lesser of i one and one-half percent 15% of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on each such Calculation Date rounded down to the nearest whole share; or ii thirty two thousand 32,000 shares of Common Stock. As of December 31, 2010, we had 50,414 shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock with a value equivalent to a percentage of the employee earnings, not to exceed the lesser of 15% of the employee earnings or $25,000, at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the offering or the date of purchase. Upon adoption of ASC 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718-10, we began recording stock-based compensation expense related to the fair value of the employee purchase rights in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2010 and 2009, we received a total of $374,000 and $537,000, respectively, primarily from the purchase of shares under the Purchase Plan. Stock-Based Compensation Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10,using the modified-prospective transition method. Under the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718-10, share-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period of the award. In addition, the adoption of ASC 718-10 requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share-based payment arrangements. Calculating share-based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the share-based awards, stock price volatility, dividend yield, risk free interest rates, and pre-vesting forfeitures. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our share-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected pre-vesting forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our share-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. The total amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows

We adopted the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to ASC 718-10 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of ASC 718-10. The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model based on assumptions noted in the following table below. The expected term of our options represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method provided for in SAB 107, as amended by SAB No110, Share-Based Payment.Because we do not have sufficient historical exercise data,we used the simplified method for estimating the stock option expected term.The risk-free interest rate for periods related to the expected life of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the expected life of the option. The expected dividend yield is zero, as we do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. During theyears ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we used forfeiture rates of 20%, based on an analysis of historical data as we reasonably approximate the currently anticipated rate of forfeiture for granted and outstanding options that have not vested.  27 Table of Contents The following assumptions were used to determine stock-based compensation during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009

The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted in the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, was $265 and $429, respectively. Earnings Per Share Information Basic loss income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted loss income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares from outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method.

In the years ended December 31, 2010and 2009, there were 619,229 and 596,128 common shares, respectively, issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants excluded from the above earnings per share calculations as their effect was anti-dilutive. Foreign Currency Transactions The functional currencies of all foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies of the respective countries. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities are included as other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.During 2009, three of our foreign subsidiaries' operations had substantially ceased and were effectively liquidated. As a result in year 2009, we wrote off $175,000 of related cumulative translation adjustments which were recorded as incometo other income, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, translation gain loss was $305,000 and $712,000, respectively, and is included in the Comprehensive incomeloss account in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholder Equity Deficit.  28 Table of Contents Comprehensive Loss Income Comprehensive loss income includes net loss income and other comprehensive income loss, which may consist of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and cumulative translation adjustments.

890 Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach in accordance with ASC 740-10,Income Taxes ASC 740-10, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, is not expected to be realized. We analyze our deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization. We have established a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to the extent that management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized based upon the uncertainty of their realization. Weconsider the effects of estimated future taxable income, current economic conditions and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. Segment and Geographic Information We operate in one segment, electronic commerce business solutions. Our chief operating decision maker is considered to be our CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region and by product for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements. More specifically, this update will require aan entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Levels1 and 2 fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers; and binformation about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements to be presented separately i.e. present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Level3 inputs. This guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level2 and Level3 inputs. The new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2009, except for the disclosure requirements related to the purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after December31, 2010. We have provided the additional required disclosures effective January 1, 2010. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13 an update to ASC 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Element Arrangements ASU 2009-13 which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after June15, 2010; however, early adoption is permitted. In arrangements with multiple deliverables, ASU 2009-13 permits entities to use managements best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables have never been sold separately or when third-party evidence is not available. In addition, any discounts provided in multiple element arrangements will be allocated on the basis of the relative selling price of each deliverable. We will apply ASU 2009-13 on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning on or after January 1, 2011.We have not yet determined the effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements if any, upon the adoption of ASU 2009-13. In June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Codification which was effective for us in the third quarter ended September30, 2009. The Codification became the single authoritative source for U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we no longer use previous references to U.S. GAAP in our disclosures included in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Codification did not have a significant impact on the reporting of our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May2009, the FASB issued ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events ASC 855-10. ASC 855-10 establishes accounting principles and requirements for subsequent events. We adopted this standard effective as of June 30, 2009. In April 2009, we adopted ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820-10, and ASC 825, Financial Instruments ASC 825-10. We also adopted ASC 320-10, Investment Debt and Equity Securities ASC 320-10, which provides guidance on determining other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities. These adoptions did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  29 Table of Contents Note2 Property and Equipment

31 Table of Contents We have provided a valuation allowance for all of our deferred tax assets as of December31, 2010 and 2009, due to the uncertainty regarding their future realization. The total valuation allowance decreased $2,412,000 from December31, 2009 to December31, 2010. As of December31, 2010, we had federal and state net operating loss NOL carryforwards of approximately $542,280,000 and $158,252,000, net of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code IRC limitations respectively, available to offset future regular and alternative minimum taxable income. The NOLs include deductions for stock based compensation for which a benefit would be recorded in additional paid-in capital when realized of $1,799,000 and $1,447,000 respectively.Our federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years from 2016 through 2030, if not used. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire in variousyears from 2016 to 2021, if not used. In addition, we had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $5,844,000 and $4,565,000 as of December 31, 2010, respectively, available to offset future tax liabilities.We had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $5,774,000 and $4,294,000 as of December 31, 2009, respectively, available to offset future tax liabilities.The federal tax credit carryforwards expire in the tax years 2010 through 2030, if not utilized. The state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss NOL and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes, as defined in IRC Section 382. Based on an IRC Section 382 study completed in February 2007, we determined that there were ownership changes during the year 1998. Consequently, a portion of our tax carryforwards will expire before they can be fully utilized. Based on an updated study completed in January 2009, we determined that there were no additional ownership changes through December 2008.Since the 2009 study, percentage holdings of 5%+ shareholders and the public group remained approximately the same. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes: Recognition ASC 740-10-25. The cumulative effect of adopting ASC 740-10-25 wasrecognized as a change in accounting principle, recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date. Our total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 were $2,565,000 and $2,421,000, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate were $320,000 and $273,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December31, 2010 is as follows Balance at January 1, 2010

We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes. During the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized approximately $17,000 and $17,000, respectively, for interest and penalties. We are subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our tax years 1996 to 2010 remain open in several jurisdictions due to the NOL carryover from those tax years. It is possible that the amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months.However, an estimate of the range of possible changes cannot be made at this time.In addition, over the next twelve months, our existing tax positions will continue to generate an increase in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.  32 Table of Contents Note 6 - Commitments and Contingencies Warranties and Indemnification We provide a warranty to our perpetual license customers that our software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation we provide with the software, typically for a period of 90 days following receipt of the software. Historically, costs related to these warranties have been immaterial. Accordingly, we have not recorded any warranty liabilities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our perpetual software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual property infringement claims caused by use of a current release of our software consistent with the terms of the license agreement. The term of these indemnification clauses is generally perpetual. The potential future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification clauses is generally limited to the amount the customer paid for the software. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have been immaterial. We also maintain liability insurance that limits our exposure. As a result, we believe the potential liability of these indemnification clauses is minimal. We rarely have litigation initiated against us by customers.However, during the year ended 2010, we entered into a litigation settlement agreement with one customer that resulted in a non-cash credit redeemable for our products worth $300,000.Pursuant to the settlement agreement, any remaining unused credits shall expire after the second anniversary of the agreement.We have recorded this credit as an addition to operating expense and liability in the accompanying 2010 Consolidated Financial Statements.In 2009 we did not record any operating expenses or liabilities related to settlement agreements. We entered into agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer is, or was, serving in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is for so long as such officer or director is subject to an indemnifiable event by reason of the fact that such person was serving in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements may be unlimited; however, we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of our insurance policy coverage, we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is insignificant. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of either December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009. We assess the need for an indemnification reserve on a quarterly basis and there can be no guarantee that an indemnification reserve will not become necessary in the future. Leases We lease our headquarters facility and our other facilities under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring through the year 2016. Under the terms of the agreements, we are required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs. A summary of total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating lease agreements is as follows in millions Years ending December 31

These future minimum lease paymentsexclude approximately $108,000 of sublease income to be received under non-cancelable sublease agreements. As of December 31, 2010 we have accrued $05 million of estimated future facilities costs as a restructuring accrual. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009 was $1,583,000 and $1,606,000, respectively. Standby Letter of Credit Commitments Commitments totaling $10million as of December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, in the form of standby letters of credit, were issued on our behalf from financial institutions, in favor of our various landlords to secure obligations under our facility leases. Legal Proceedings We are subject from time to time to various legal actions and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings.  33 Table of Contents Note7 Restructuring The following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity recorded during the two-years ended December31, 2010 in thousands

The facilities/excess assets accrual for each period includes future minimum lease payments, fees and expenses, net of estimated sublease income and planned Company occupancy, and related leasehold improvement amounts payable subsequent to the balance sheet date for which the provisions of ASC 420-10, as applicable, were satisfied. In determining estimated future sublease income, the following factors were considered, among others: current market conditions and rental rates, an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made, the status of negotiations with potential subtenants, and the location of the respective facilities. In September 2006, we decided not to exercise a $45 million buy-out option for a 50,000 square foot lease for 66 months from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2012 at Pacific Shores Center in Redwood City, California. We instead decided to occupy a portion of the new space and sub-lease the remaining excess space. In January 2007, we moved into our current worldwide headquarters at Pacific Shores Center, occupying approximately 27,000square feet of office facilities used for research and development, technical support, sales, marketing, consulting, training and administration. We subleased approximately 22,500square feet effective on January 8, 2007 and our subtenant signed early termination agreement for this sublease with us in year 2009. In connection with one of the buyout transactions, we issued to the landlord a five-year warrant to purchase approximately 28,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $12500 per share, exercisable beginning in August2005. The shares underlying the warrants issued in connection with a real estate buyout transaction in August 2004 were not exercised and expired in July 2009. See Note8 Stockholders Equity Deficit in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The nature of the charges and credits in 2010 were as follows  Facilities/excess assets The net restructuring charge of $850,000 for year 2010 consists of a $607,000 charge resulting from a sublease income assumption adjustment made for our vacant Redwood City, California facilities and a $419,000 charge related to rent payments made by us resulting from our inability to sublease the facilities in the period, offset by the collection of $176,000 from our former subtenant from our New York City facilities. The nature of the charges and credits in 2009 were as follows  Facilities/excess assets During 2009, we signed a Sublease Termination and Release Agreement the Sublease Termination Agreement with our subtenant Dexterra Inc.Under the terms of the Sublease Termination Agreement, Dexterra Inc. was to i surrender the premises, on an as-is basis, and all of its rights and interest in the premises, ii pay a termination fee to us and iii be entitled to a partial refund of the termination fee if any party subleases the office space during the period from June 10, 2009 through January 7, 2010. In addition to the termination fee, we retained Dexterra Inc. security deposit of $128,000. The termination fee of $678,000 less the retained security deposit of $128,000 is payable in two installments. Dexterra Inc. paid the first installment of $472,000 to us on June 10, 2009, and shall pay the second installment of $78,000 on June 10, 2010, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Sublease Termination Agreement. The second installment of the termination fee is being amortized into restructuring charges over the remaining term of the lease, which will expire on June 30, 2012.Because of the early termination of our sublease agreement, we recalculated our restructuring liability in accordance with ASC 420-10.As a result, we recognized restructuring charges of $71,000 as operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March 5, 2010, the 22,500 square feet of formerly subleased space remains vacant.We are making the lease payments and paying operating expenses, and actively seeking to sublease the space. As of December 31, 2010, we have remaining lease obligations of approximately $25 million. As of December31, 2010, the total restructuring accrual of $534,000 consisted of the following in thousands

Part II Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation as of December 31, 2010 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which are defined under the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2010, and has concluded that there was no change during such year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report. Managements report shall not be deemed to be filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls As a result of being a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding our internal control over financial reporting. We have elected to not include such an attestation report in this annual report, which election was approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Item 1. Business
