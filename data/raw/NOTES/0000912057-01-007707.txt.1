Transgenomic,Inc.
Omaha, Nebraska 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Transgenomic,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2000 and 1999 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2000. These financial statements are the

financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Transgenomic,Inc. and subsidiaries as of

A.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Business Description. 
Transgenomic,Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries the Company provide innovative research tools to the life sciences industry. These
tools enable researchers to discover and understand variation in the human genetic code, or genome, in order to accelerate and improve drug development and diagnostics. The Company markets and sells
these platforms primarily throughout North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. Through March31, 2000, the Company also manufactured and designed sample preparation and monitoring instruments,
which were primarily used with various types of optical and mass spectrometers to analyze the chemical makeup of samples. The assets related to this non-life sciences product line were
sold effective April1, 2000. 
Principles of Consolidation. 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Transgenomic,Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Transgenomic,Ltd., which
provides sales and customer support in Europe, Transgenomic Japan,Inc., which sponsors a sales and support branch office in Japan and Transgenomic St. Thomas,Inc., which is organized
as a foreign sales corporation. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Sales and Distribution Strategy. 
The Company sells its products in two major ways: 1DirectThe Company serves the United States and European markets through direct sales efforts from the Company
headquarters in Omaha and Transgenomic,Ltd. headquarters in Crewe, United Kingdom. The Company has direct salespeople strategically located to cover all sections of the United States and
Europe.
2DistributorsThe Company also sells its products to distributors in its major European, Pacific Rim and other markets. 
The
Company has sales offices in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan. These offices function mainly as service and support centers and also as sales resources for OEM and
distributor customers in Europe and Japan. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents. 
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and temporary investments with original maturities at acquisition of three months
or less. 
Short Term Investments. 
The Company classifies all of its short term investments with maturities at acquisition of greater than three months as available for sale securities. Such
short term investments consist primarily of United States government and federal agency securities, corporate commercial paper and mutual funds which are stated at market value, with unrealized gains
and losses on such securities reflected, net of tax, as other 
33  comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses on short term investments are included in earnings and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the
cost of securities. It is the Company intent to maintain a liquid portfolio to take advantage of investment opportunities; therefore, all securities are considered to be available for sale and are
classified as current assets. 
Accounts Receivable. 
Accounts receivable are shown net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $180 and $161 in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Payment terms generally are 30 or
60days. The Company has also provided extended payment terms to some of its customers. Accounts receivable balances subject to extended terms were approximately $105 as of December31,
2000 and $216 as of December31, 1999. Balances due more than one year from the balance sheet date were approximately $0 and $77, respectively. 
Inventories. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market. The Company has certain finished goods inventory it
provides as demonstration units to potential customers for evaluation, as well as to certain universities and original equipment manufacturers for testing and demonstration. All demonstration units
are held for resale and included in inventory at the lower of cost or market. Demonstration inventory that is greater than one year old and remains held for resale is reclassified from current assets
to long-term assets and carried at the lower of cost or market. If the customer or institution does not purchase the instrument, it is retrieved, and, if necessary, reconditioned for sale.
Demonstration inventory is evaluated for impairment based on its physical condition and technological status. No impairment loss has been recognized to date. At the time these instruments no longer
are held for resale and will be used for in-house testing and analysis, they are transferred from inventory to property at the lower of cost or market and depreciated. Demonstration
equipment included in property and equipment is used for research and development and training. Property and Equipment. 
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed by the straight-line and accelerated methods over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows: Furniture and fixtures
5 to 7years Production equipment
5 to 7years Computer equipment
5years Research and development equipment
3 to 5years Demonstration equipment
3 to 5years Goodwill. 
Goodwill arising from the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets at dates of acquisition is being amortized using the straight-line
method over 15years. 
34 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. 
The Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets held for use, including certain intangible assets and goodwill, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, if the sum of the expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest resulting from
the use of the asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets. No impairment loss has
been recognized to date. 
Other Assets. 
Other assets include patents and intellectual property. The Company capitalizes the external and in-house legal costs and filing fees associated
with obtaining patents on its new discoveries and amortizes these costs using the straight-line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life, generally
17years, beginning on the date the patent is issued. Intellectual property, which is purchased technology, is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life of between 5 and
10years. 
Deferred Financing Costs. 
Deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related financing using the effective interest method. 
Stock Based Compensation. 
The Company accounts for its employee stock option grants under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, which utilizes the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the
excess, if any, of the deemed fair market value of the Company common stock at the date of grant over the stock option exercise price. Stock option grants to nonemployees are accounted for using the
fair value method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
using the Black-Scholes model. 
Unearned Compensation. 
Unearned compensation represents the unamortized difference between the option exercise price and the deemed fair market value of the Company common stock at
the option grant date, for options issued under the Company Stock Option Plan NoteL. The unearned compensation is charged to operations over the vesting period of the respective options. Income Taxes. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at each
balance sheet date using tax rates expected to be in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is
unlikely they will be realized. 
35 
Revenue Recognition. 
Sales of products are recorded based on receipt of an unconditional customer order and shipment of product. The Company sales terms do not provide for the
right of return unless the product is damaged or defective. Installation and training revenues are deferred and recognized when earned. 
Research and Development. 
Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred. Translation of Foreign Currency. 
Financial statements of subsidiaries outside the U.S. are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The adjustments to translate those
amounts into U.S. dollars are accumulated in a separate account in stockholders' equity and are included in other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from
changes in currency exchange rates are included in the determination of net income. For the periods presented, foreign currency transaction adjustments were not significant. 
Comprehensive Income. 
Comprehensive income for all periods presented consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on available for
sale investments. The Company deems its foreign investments to be permanent in nature and does not provide for taxes on currency translation adjustments arising from converting its investments in a
foreign currency to U.S. dollars. There were no reclassification adjustments to be reported in the periods presented. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. 
The carrying amount of the Company cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of those instruments. The Company derives the fair value of its short term investments based on quoted market prices. Earnings Per Share. 
Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share
include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants or conversion of convertible notes, where dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share as they have an antidilutive effect due to the Company net loss. 
Accounting Pronouncements. 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, is effective for all fiscal
years beginning after June15, 2000. SFAS133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain 
36  derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. Under SFAS133, certain contracts that were not formerly considered derivatives may now meet the definition of a
derivative. The Company will adopt SFAS133 effective January1, 2001. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS133 to have a significant impact on the financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. 
Use of Estimates. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications. 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1998 and 1999 financial statements to conform to the 2000 presentation. 
B.SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS 
The amortization cost of available-for-sale securities and their approximate fair values at December31, 2000 were as follows: Amortized

On March23, 1999, the Company received approximately $114million of net proceeds from the placement of $12million aggregate principal
amount 6% convertible notes due March25, 2002. Interest on the notes compounded at 6% per annum until the completion of the Company initial public offering. The Company initial public
offering impacted the notes as follows: on
the effective date of the Company initial public offering interest payable on the notes was accelerated through the maturity date of the notes at an
annual interest rate of 36%. As a result, the Company recorded additional interest expense of approximately $08million.
The
Company was provided a conversion feature that would allow the Company, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to cause a conversion of the
principal plus accrued interest into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $500 per share. The conversion feature was formula driven and based partially upon the average trading price
of the Company stock over 20 consecutive trading days.
On
August14, 2000, the Company Board of Directors authorized the Company to convert the notes into common stock upon meeting the required
conditions. On August15, 2000, such conditions were met, and the notes were converted into 2,750,906 shares of common stock. All principal and accrued interest at the conversion date of
approximately $139million was converted to stockholders equity. The
effective interest rate, including a redemption premium, was 93% at December31, 1999. At December1999, the convertible notes payable balance was comprised of the following: Principal 12,000 Accrued interest and redemption premium 859 12,859 Deferred financing costs net of accumulated amortization of $150 438 12,421 39 
H.LEASE COMMITMENTS 
The Company leases certain equipment, vehicles and operating facilities. The Company leases related to its operating facilities currently expire on various
dates ranging from 2000 through 2007. However,
one lease allows for cancellation at either 36 or 48months upon 60days advanced written notice. At December31, 2000, the future minimum lease payments required under
noncancellable lease provisions are approximately $901 in 2001; $948 in 2002; $945 in 2003; $730 in 2004; $598 in 2005; and a total of approximately $335 in rental payments for the years 2006 through
2007. Rent expense related to all operating leases for the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately $966, $984 and $655, respectively. 
I.INCOME TAXES 
Loss before income taxes consists of the following: Years ended December 31 2000
1999
1998 United States 8,231 7,671 2,617 International 250 411 111 8,481 8,082 2,506 The

The
Company provision for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 differs from the amounts determined by applying the statutory Federal income tax
rate to income before income taxes for the following reasons: 2000
1999
1998 Benefit at Federal Rate 2,884 2,748 852 Increase decrease resulting from State income taxesnet of federal benefit 119 63 86 Intangible amortization 39 43 39 Research and development tax credit 69 54 24 Meals and entertainment 43 39 27 Othernet 33 37 34 Valuation allowance 3,137 4,491 Total income tax expense benefit 180 1,745 930 The
Company deferred income tax asset at December31, 2000 and 1999 is comprised of the following temporary differences: 2000
1999 Net operating loss carryforward 7,359 4,289 Allowance for doubtful accounts 61 60 Fixed asset depreciation 48 124 Accrued vacation 97 137 Other 2 61 7,563 4,671 Less valuation allowance 7,563 4,491 180 At
December31, 2000, the Company has unused tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $21 million which expire in 2012, $18 million which expire in 2018, $77
million which will expire in 2019 and $83million which will expire in 2020. Additionally, at December31, 2000, the Company has unused general business credits earned primarily through
increased research expenditures of approximately $02 million. These credits expire at various times between 2010 and 2020. The deferred tax asset of $180 as of December31, 1999 was realized
through the sale of the product line assets discussed in NoteM. A valuation allowance has been provided in 2000 for the remaining deferred tax assets, due to the Company cumulative losses in
recent years, expected losses in future years and an inability to utilize any additional losses as carrybacks. The Company will continue to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the
related valuation allowance. To the extent the Company begins to generate income in future years and it is determined that such valuation allowance is no longer required, the tax benefit of the
remaining deferred tax assets will be recognized at such time. 
41

matches the employees' contributions at the rate of 50% on the first 6% of contributions. The Company may at the discretion of its Board of
Directors, make additional contributions on behalf of the Plan participants. Company contributions were $220, $175 and $118 for the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. K.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

any, on the issue or reissue of any additional preferred stock; and viwhether shares have voting rights. The preferred stock may be issued with a preference over the common stock as to the
payment of dividends. The Company has no current plans to issue any series of preferred stock. Classes of stock such as the preferred stock may be used, in certain circumstances, to create voting
impediments on extraordinary corporate transactions or to frustrate persons seeking to effect a merger or otherwise to gain control of the Company. For the foregoing reasons, any preferred stock
issued by the Company could have an adverse effect on the rights of the holders of the common stock. 
Common Stock. 
In March2000, the Company Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 60,000,000, subject to the approval of
the Company stockholders. 
In
March2000, the Company issued 25,000 common shares at $1000 per share to an individual who was subsequently elected to the Company Board of Directors. 
On
July21, 2000, the Company issued 5,152,000 shares of common stock in its initial public offering at $1500 per share. After payment of the underwriters' discounts and
commissions and other expenses, the 
42  Company received net proceeds of approximately $699million from this offering. In addition, since the date of the initial public offering, holders of warrants and options to purchase shares
of common stock have exercised at various times. The Company has received an additional $27million in net proceeds from these exercises. 
L.STOCK OPTIONS 
The Company 1997 Stock Option Plan, as amended the Stock Option Plan, allows the Company to grant both incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
options to acquire shares of the Company common stock to employees and directors of the Company and to nonemployee advisors. Either incentive or non-qualified stock options may be
granted to employees of the Company, but only nonqualified stock options may be granted to nonemployee directors and advisors. The maximum number of shares for which options may be granted under the
Stock Option Plan is 6,000,000. The Stock Option Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee which has the authority to set the number, exercise
price, term and vesting provisions of the options granted under the Stock Option Plan, subject to the terms thereof. The options must be granted at exercise prices not less than the fair market value
of the common stock on the date of the grant. Generally, the stock options vest at a rate of 20% per year over a five year period and expire 10years after the date the option was granted. If
the option holder ceases to be employed by the Company, the Company will have the right to terminate any outstanding but unexercised options.

The
weighted average fair value of options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $543, $100 and $102, respectively. 
The
Company has elected to follow the measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, under which no recognition of expense is required in accounting for
stock options granted to employees for which the exercise price equals or exceeds the deemed fair market value of the stock at the grant date. In those cases where options have been granted with an
exercise price below the deemed fair market value, the Company recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line method over the vesting periods of the individual stock options.
During December1999, the Company recorded unearned compensation of $113 for options granted with exercise prices less than the deemed fair market value at the date of grant. In the first
quarter of 2000, the Company recorded unearned
compensation of $298 for options granted with exercise prices less than the deemed fair market value at the date of grant. These amounts are being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting
periods of the individual stock options using the straight-line method. Such amortization expense amounted to approximately $73 in 2000. 
During
2000, the Company recorded unearned compensation of $271 and compensation expense of $133 for options granted to non-employees. The unearned compensation associated
with these grants is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting periods of the individual stock options using the straight-line method. Such amortization expense amounted to
approximately $81 in 2000. The expense amounts were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: no common stock dividends, risk-free interest
rates ranging from 511% to 657%; volatility of 35%; and an expected option life of 1 to 5years. 
In
connection with the sale of the Company non-life sciences instrument product line, the Company accelerated the vesting of 71,700 options, which would have otherwise
been forfeited. Compensation expense of approximately $574 was recorded for these options during the first quarter of 2000, representing the difference between the exercise price of the options and
the deemed fair value of the common stock at the date the vesting was accelerated. In addition, 218,700 options were forfeited as a result of the sale.

Pro
forma information regarding net income and income per share is required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123, Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation, SFAS No123 assuming the Company accounted for its employee stock options using the fair value method. The fair value of each stock option
granted is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: no
common stock dividends, risk-free interest rates ranging from 511% to 653% and 551% to 613% and 574% to 633%; 35% volatility and no volatility prior to becoming a public company;
and an expected option life of 1 to 10years. Pro forma net income and income per share assuming compensation expense for the Stock Option Plan had been determined under SFAS No123,
are as follows: 2000

Sale of Product Line. 
On May19, 2000, the Company sold the assets related to its non-life sciences instrument product line to a company controlled by Stephen F.
Dwyer, a director and principal stockholder of the Company, for a total adjusted purchase price of $565million plus reimbursement by the purchaser of approximately $400 of expenses paid by
the Company in connection with this product line since March31, 2000. The effective date of the transaction was April1, 2000. Approximately $365million of the purchase price
was paid in cash and $20million was paid with an 875% interest-bearing promissory note due on December30, 2000. The purchaser financed the cash portion of the purchase price for
these assets plus initial working capital needs with borrowings of approximately $46million obtained from a bank. The Company acquired the notes evidencing these loans from the bank upon
closing of its initial public offering on July21, 2000 by paying to the bank an amount equal to the entire principal balance of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. The acquired notes
were due on December30, 2000, and had an interest rate of 875% per annum. These acquired notes were consolidated with the original $20million note. All of the principal and accrued
interest on this consolidated note was repaid prior to maturity. On December29, 2000, we repurchased 261,904 shares of our common stock from Mr.Dwyer for $1050 per share, which was
the closing price for our common stock on that day, for an aggregate purchase price of $27million. Mr.Dwyer used these proceeds and additional resources to pay the principal and
interest on the consolidated note.
