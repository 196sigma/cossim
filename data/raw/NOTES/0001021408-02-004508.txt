To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Chordiant Software, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Chordiant Software, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except per share data
NOTE 1--THE COMPANY We were incorporated in California in March 1991 and reincorporated in Delaware
in October 1997. We provide customer relationship management CRM software
solutions for global business-to-consumer enterprise companies. We believe our
solutions enable these companies, who depend upon and value their customer
relationships, to build long-term, profitable relationships with customers. Our
target customers are companies with a multitude of highly complex and demanding
customer relationships that require high levels of personalized services. Our
customers include global companies in the financial services,
telecommunications, retail and integrated travel services industries. Our
solutions seek to fulfill the requirements of these companies for
enterprise-wide CRM software infrastructure solutions capable of servicing
millions of individual customers across multiple communication channels in
real-time. Our solutions enable organizations to market, sell, and serve their
customers across multiple channels, including call centers, branch
representatives and self-serve channels such as automated telephony, the web and
e-mail. During 2001, we expanded our product offering through the acquisitions
of Prime Response, Inc., certain assets of ASP Outfitters, Inc., ActionPoint,
Inc., Pyxis, Inc., and EDS.
NOTE 2--LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have incurred losses and negative cash flows since inception. For the year
ended December 31, 2001, we incurred a net loss of approximately $42,300 and
negative cash flows from operations of approximately $27,100. Our cash balances
may decline further although we believe that the effects of our strategic
actions implemented to improve revenue as well as control costs will be adequate
to generate sufficient cash resources to fund our operations. Failure to
generate sufficient revenues or control spending could adversely affect our
ability to achieve our business objectives.
NOTE 3--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to
current year presentation.
Principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and
those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Such estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts,
valuation of deferred tax assets and the estimates associated with the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting for certain of our revenue
contracts.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from their
date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.
Our short-term investments consist of debt securities with maturities greater
than three months at the date of purchase. We classify all short-term
investments as available-for-sale. Accordingly, our investments are carried at
fair value as of the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses are
reported net of related taxes as a separate component of stockholder equity
deficit. Additionally, the cost of securities sold is based upon the specific
identification method. At December 31, 2000 and 2001, amortized cost
approximated fair value and unrealized gains and losses were insignificant.
47 The portfolio of short-term investments including cash and cash equivalents
consisted of the following                        December 31,
2000      2001
Cash                  $  15,671   $  14,340
Money market and money funds          222      3,793
Commercial paper              22,975      16,704
U.S. Corporate bonds              637       495
U.S. Corporate notes             3,249      4,307
Municipal bonds               22,093      9,200
U.S. Government bonds and notes       2,821      2,301
$  67,668   $  51,140
Restricted cash
At December 31, 2001, we had a balance of $10 million in the form of short-term
investments, which were restricted from withdrawal. The balance serves as a
security deposit in a revenue transaction.
Fair value of financial instruments
Our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and
borrowings are carried at cost, which approximates fair value because of the
short-term nature of those instruments. The reported amounts of borrowings
approximate fair value due to the market value interest rates that these debts
bear.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, we entered into foreign currency
forward exchange contracts to hedge against exposure to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates of underlying assets and liabilities, primarily certain
receivables that are denominated in British pounds. For the years ended December
31, 2001 and 2000, the gains and losses were insignificant. As of December 31,
2001, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, including goodwill, purchased technology and other intangible
assets, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. We amortize goodwill
and other identifiable intangibles on year straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives which range from one-half year to three years. see Note
4 in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January 1, 2002,
which will result in us no longer amortizing our existing goodwill. At December
31, 2001, net goodwill was $17,922 and goodwill amortization expense was $6,635
for the year ended December 31, 2001. We will be required to measure goodwill
for impairment effective January 1, 2002 as part of the transition period. Any
impairment resulting from the transition provisions will be recorded as of
January 1, 2002 and will be recognized as the effect of a change in accounting
principle. We will not be able to determine if an impairment will be required
until completion of such impairment evaluation.
Revenue recognition
We derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services, which
include assistance in implementation, customization and integration,
post-contract customer support, training and consulting.
On contracts involving significant implementation or customization essential to
the functionality of our product, license and service revenues are recognized
under the percentage-of-completion method using labor hours incurred as the
measure of progress towards completion as prescribed by Statement of Position
SOP No. 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Product-Type Contracts. We
48 consider a project completed at the go-live date. Provisions for estimated
contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable
and can be reasonably estimated. When we sell additional licenses, revenue is
recognized after the go-live date if the products or seats have been delivered
and no remaining obligations exist. We classify revenues from these arrangements
as license and services revenues based upon the estimated fair value of each
element.
On contracts that do not involve significant implementation or customization
essential to the functionality of our product, license fees are recognized when
there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee
that is probable of collection and when delivery has occurred as prescribed by
SOP No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. For arrangements with multiple
elements, we recognize revenue for services and post-contract customer support
based upon vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of the
respective elements. VSOE of fair value for the services element is based upon
the standard hourly rates we charge for services when such services are sold
separately. VSOE of fair value for annual post-contract customer support is
established with the optional stated future renewal rates included in the
contracts. When contracts contain multiple elements, and VSOE of fair value
exists for all undelivered elements, we account for the delivered elements,
principally the license portion, based upon the residual method as prescribed
by SOP No. 98-9, Modification of SOP No. 97-2 with Respect to Certain
Transactions.
In situations in which we are not responsible for implementation services but
are obligated to provide unspecified additional software products in the future,
we recognize revenue as a subscription ratably over the term of the commitment
period.
Revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell-through method,
when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end-users.
Our agreements with customers and resellers do not contain product return
rights.
Other services revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as
such services are performed. Service revenues from post-contract customer
support are recognized ratably over the support period, generally one year.
Concentrations of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts
receivable. To date, we have invested excess funds in money market accounts,
commercial paper, municipal bonds and term notes. We deposit cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments with financial institutions that
management believes are credit worthy. Our accounts receivable are derived from
revenues earned from customers located in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of
the World ROW. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers'
financial condition and, generally, require no collateral from our customers. We
maintain reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed
necessary.
The following table summarizes the revenues from customers in excess of 10% of
total net revenues            Year Ended December 31,
1999     2000     2001
Company A      30%
Company B      19%
Company C                   10%
Company D                   10%
Company E            14%
Company F            19%      18%
Company G      15%     30%      13                    49 At December 31, 2001, Companies D and G accounted for 17% and 10%, respectively,
of our accounts receivable. At December 31, 2000, Company F accounted for 64% of
accounts receivable.
Research and Development
Costs incurred in the research and development of new products and enhancements
to existing products are charged to expense as incurred until the technological
feasibility of the product or enhancement has been established through the
development of a working model. After establishing technological feasibility,
additional development costs incurred through the date the product is available
for general release to customers would be capitalized and amortized over the
estimated product life. To date, the period between achieving technological
feasibility and general release has been short and software development costs
qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, we have not
capitalized any software development costs.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of assets, which
range from three to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the economic life
of the asset or the lease term. Purchased internal-use software consists
primarily of amounts paid for perpetual licenses to third party software
applications, which are amortized over their estimated useful life, generally
three years.
Long-lived assets
We review for impairment our long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be
recoverable. When such an event occurs, we estimate the future cash flows
expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If
the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of
the asset, an impairment loss is recognized. To date, no impairment loss has
been recognized.
Advertising costs
Advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred.
Advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 totaled
$1,340, $838 and $1,671, respectively.
Internal Use Software
Software development costs, including costs incurred to purchase third party
software, are capitalized beginning when we have determined factors are present,
including among others, that technology exists to achieve the performance
requirements, buy versus internal development decisions have been made and our
management has authorized the funding for the project. Capitalization of
software costs ceases when the software is substantially complete and is ready
for its intended use and is amortized over its estimated useful life of three
years using the straight-line method.
Stock-based employee compensation
We account for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations and comply with the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the
difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of our
stock and the exercise price of the stock option being granted. Stock-based
compensation is amortized in accordance with FIN 28 using the multiple option
approach. SFAS No. 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for an
employee stock option or similar equity instrument. The pro forma disclosures of
the difference between compensation expense included in net loss and the cost
measured by the fair value method are presented in Note 16.
We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No.
96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services.
50 Foreign currency translation
The functional currency of our foreign entities is their respective local
currency. Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the current
exchange rates at each balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated
at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year. The related gains
and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity deficit.
Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included
in other income expense, net and were not significant during the periods
presented.
Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach, which
requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events
that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The
measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are based on
provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or
rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if
necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence,
are not expected to be realized.
Reverse stock split
In November 1999, our Board of Directors approved a 1-for-2 reverse stock split
of our outstanding shares of capital stock. The reverse stock split became
effective on February 2000. All share and per share information included in
these consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this
reverse stock split.
Net loss per share
Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for
the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. The calculation of diluted net loss per share includes
potential common stock unless their effect is antidilutive. Potential common
stock consist of the incremental number of common shares issuable upon
conversion of Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock using the if-
converted method, common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
using the treasury stock method and common shares issuable upon the assumed
conversion of convertible debt using the if-converted method and common shares
subject to repurchase by us.

share for the periods indicated                                 Year Ended December 31,

Segment information
Our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a
consolidated basis, accompanied by desegregated information about revenues by
geographic regions for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing
financial performance. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single
industry segment, specifically the license, implementation and support of our
software products.
License revenues for enterprise solutions amounted to $8,007, $16,896 and
$26,935 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Software license revenues for application products was approximately $12,729 for
the year ended December 31, 2001.
Services revenues consist of consulting assistance and implementation,
customization and integration and post-contract customer support and training.
Services revenues for enterprise solutions was approximately $9,581, 16,793 and
$27,305 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations which supercedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 requires the purchase
method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and
eliminates the pooling-of-interests method. In addition, SFAS No. 141
establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets
separately from goodwill and requires unamortized negative goodwill to be
written off immediately as an extraordinary gain, instead of being deferred and
amortized. The provisions of SFAS No141 have been adopted as of July 1, 2001.
The adoption of SFAS No. 141 has not changed the method of accounting used in
previous business combinations initiated prior to July 1, 2001.
In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
SFAS No. 142 requires, among other things, the discontinuance of goodwill
amortization. In addition, the standard includes provisions upon adoption for
the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill,
reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles,
reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and
the testing for impairment of existing goodwill and other intangibles. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142, we will cease to amortize approximately $17,922 of
goodwill, we had recorded approximately $6,635 of amortization on these amounts
during 2001. We will be required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill
balance upon the initial adoption of SFAS No. 142.
We expect to complete the initial review during the second quarter of 2002. We
do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial
review, however, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is
completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded.
In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No. 144 requires that long-lived assets to
be disposed of by sale, including discontinued operations, be measured at the
lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in
continuing operations or in discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 also broadens
the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include all components
of an entity that have operations and cash flows that can be clearly
distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest
of the entity. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. We are evaluating the effect of this
statement on our results of operations and financial position.
In November 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached consensus on
EITF No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a
Reseller of the Vendor Products. EITF No. 01-9 addresses the accounting for
consideration given by a vendor to a customer and is a codification of EITF No.
00-14, Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives, EITF No. 00-22 Accounting for
`Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales Incentives Offers
and Offers for Free Products or Services to be Delivered in the Future and EITF
No. 00-25, Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a
Reseller of the Vendor Products. We do not believe that upon adoption it will
have a significant impact on our financial statements.
In November 2001, the FASB reached consensus on Topic No. D-103, Income
Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out of Pocket Expenses
Incurred. The FASB concluded that reimbursements received for out of pocket
expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the income statement.
Historically, we have recorded reimbursements as a reduction of services
53 cost of revenue. This pronouncement will be applied in financial reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2001, and comparative financial statements
for prior periods will be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this
pronouncement. We believe the adoption of this pronouncement will not result in
a material increase in our services revenue and services cost of revenue.
NOTE 4--ACQUISITIONS During 2000 and 2001, we completed the following acquisitions that were
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in thousands -  On May 29, 2001, we acquired certain intellectual property assets and
technology of the AoNet J2EE Workflow Server from ASP Outfitter, Inc. -  On May 17, 2001, we acquired certain assets associated with the Dialog
Server product suite from ActionPoint, Inc., as a result of which certain
members of the Dialog Server development, support, sales and marketing team
from Actionpoint, Inc. became our employees. -  On March 27, 2001, we acquired Prime Response, an integrated marketing
software solutions company headquartered in Boston, MA. -  On July 19, 2000, we acquired White Spider, a provider of software
consulting services and a developer of a knowledge management software
product headquartered in Manchester, NH.
The results of each of these acquisitions have been included in our operating
results from the date of acquisition. In thousands                                  ActionPoint

The value of the shares issued was determined based on our market price for a
reasonable period before and after the date the terms of the acquisition are
agreed upon and announced.
54 The value of the options included in the purchase price was determined using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. To the extent that services were required
subsequent to the date of the acquisition in order to vest in the replacement
unvested options, the intrinsic value of the unvested options was deducted from
the fair value of the options issued and allocated to unearned compensation. The
amount allocated to unearned compensation will be recognized as compensation
expense over the remaining future vesting period.
The total purchase price is subject to adjustments based upon our finalization
of integration plans, which may include elimination of duplicate facilities and
fixed assets as well as employee severance. The total purchase price for each
acquisition has been allocated as follows in thousands Acquired Company or Assets as applicable              ActionPoint

Tangible assets acquired principally include cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, fixed assets and other assets. Liabilities assumed principally
include accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The value of the purchased in-process research and development was determined by
estimating the projected net cash flows related to the product under
development, determined based upon our estimates of costs to complete the
development of the technology and the future revenue to be earned upon
commercialization of the products. The estimated stage of completion expressed
as a percentage of completion was calculated and then applied to the net cash
flow for the product. Discount rates of 40%, 25%, 35% and 25% were applied to
the projected cash flows of the in-process research and development to determine
their net present value for the ASP Outfitter AoNet, ActionPoint Dialog
Server, Prime Response and White Spider products under development,
respectively. In-process research and development efforts associated with the
acquisition from ASP Outfitter, Inc., consisted of one project for which the
estimated state of completion was approximately 50%. In-process research and
development efforts associated with the Dialog Server assets acquired from
ActionPoint, Inc. consisted of one project for which the estimated state of
completion was approximately 75%. Prime Response in-process research and
development efforts consisted of three projects for which the estimated states
of completion were approximately 47%, 21% and 79%. White Spider in-process
research and development efforts consisted of one project for which the
estimated state of completion was approximately 67%.
The value attributed to in-process research and development was charged to
expense in the period the acquisitions were consummated. The write-offs were
necessary because the acquired in-process technologies had not yet reached
technological feasibility, and in our opinion, have no future alternative uses.
The product under development may not achieve commercial viability. The nature
of the efforts required to develop the purchased in-process research and
development into a commercially viable product principally relate to the
completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to
meet its designed specifications, including functions, features and technical
performance requirements.
The value allocated to the assembled workforce was determined by estimating the
cost involved in assembling a new workforce including costs of salaries,
benefits, training and recruiting. Workforce in place is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit, which is between two
and three years.
55 The excess of purchase price over tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill and was being
amortized over a three year period on a straight-line basis. Beginning on
January 1, 2002, our unamortized balance of goodwill will no longer be
amortized, but will continue to be subject to a periodic impairment assessment.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information reflects
the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001 and December 31,
2000, as if the acquisitions of Prime Response, White Spider, assets associated

Outfitter had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, after giving
effect to purchase accounting adjustments. These pro forma results have been

Note 5 - ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY
During 2000, we acquired certain technology and intellectual property from a
customer for $3,500. The acquired technology was still in development a the time
of the acquistion and has no alternative use. As a result, the entire amount of
$3,500 was expensed as in-process research and development.
In October 2001, we acquired certain intellectual property assets and technology
of the iApply technology from Pyxis, Inc. At the time of the acquisition, the
technology consisted of one project that had not reached technological
feasibility and had no alternative use. As a result, the total consideration of
$302 was expensed as in-process research and development.
In December 31, 2001, we acquired from EDS certain XML interface technology from
$731.
NOTE 6 - DISPOSITION OF MARKETING SERVICE PROVIDER BUSINESS
On September 24, 2001, we sold our Marketing Service Provider Business the
Business for cash proceeds of $1,600 to HNC Software International, Inc. The
Business was acquired from Prime Response, Inc. The results of operations of the
Business from the date of the acquisition of Prime Response to the date of the
sale of the Business are included in our results of operations. No gain or loss
was recorded on the sale of the Business.
NOTE 7 - RESTRUCTURING
On March 27, 2001 we completed the acquisition of Prime Response, Inc.
Associated with the acquisition, several areas of the company were restructured
to prioritize our initiatives around high-growth areas of our business, reduce
expenses, and improve efficiency due to macro-economic conditions. This
restructuring program includes a worldwide workforce reduction, consolidation of
excess facilities, and restructuring of certain business functions.
56 Workforce reduction
The restructuring program resulted in the reduction of eleven regular employees,
seven in the general and administrative function in the United States and four
in the sales and marketing function based outside the United States. The
workforce reductions were completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. We
recorded a workforce reduction charge of approximately $689 relating primarily
to severance and benefits.
Consolidation of excess facilities
We accrued for lease costs of $774 in the first quarter of 2001 pertaining to
the estimated future gross obligations for non-cancelable lease payments for
excess facilities that were vacated due to reductions in workforce. During the
quarter ended June 30, 2001, we entered into a favorable sublease transaction,
which led to a $210 reduction in the restructuring reserve.
A summary of the restructuring cost and other special charges is outlined as
follows in thousands                                Severance and      Asset

Amounts related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of facilities
will be paid over the lease term through fiscal 2011. We expect to substantially
complete our restructuring program during the next three months.
NOTE 8 - LITIGATION
Beginning in July 2001, we and certain of our officers and directors, as well as
certain of the underwriters from the our initial public offering, were named as
defendants in several class action shareholder complaints filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York and consolidated
under the caption, Weiss v. Chordiant Software, Inc., et al., Case No.
01-CV-6222. In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that we, certain of our
officers and directors and our initial public offering underwriters violated the
federal securities laws because our registration statement and prospectus for
our initial public offering contained untrue statements of material fact or
omitted material facts regarding the compensation to be received by, and the
stock allocation practices of, the underwriters. The plaintiffs seek unspecified
monetary damages and other relief. Similar complaints were filed in the same
court against numerous public companies that conducted initial public offerings
of their common stock since the mid-1990s. This action may divert the efforts
and attention of our management and, if determined adversely to us, could have a
material impact on our business.

write-offs against the allowance for doubtful accounts were $0, $529 and $0 in
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.                                December 31,

NOTE 10--SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing
of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a percentage of the
underlying revenue. Royalty expense was approximately $263, $873, and $1,982 in
fiscal 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.
During 1996, we entered into a Value-Added Reseller License and Services
Agreement the Agreement with Forte, Inc. Under the Agreement, as amended, we
may acquire full-use product licenses for assignment to one or more third-party
end-users and pay Sun Microsystems the license fees due upon delivery of the
product licenses. The amounts payable to Sun Microsystems are charged to the
end-user by us and are recognized as a cost of net revenues. Total expenses
recorded were approximately $263, $853 and $1,311 in fiscal 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively.
NOTE 11--RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We previously entered into agreements with EDS, which was a holder of our
mandatorily-redeemable convertible preferred stock. These agreements consist
primarily of product licenses and related services. Revenues and related costs
of revenues, together with deferred revenues and accounts receivable from EDS
have been separately disclosed in the financial statements until they ceased to
be a related party. During 2001, EDS sold its ownership in us and as a result
ceased to be a related party. Revenues, accounts receivable and deferred revenue
balances are no longer presented as related parties.
During 2000, we issued to one of our executives 200 shares of common stock
subject to a right of repurchase in exchange for a note receivable the Note
of $800. The Note was collateralized by the underlying stock and bore interest
at a rate of 588%. In 2001, we repurchased a total of 117 unvested shares at
the original exercise price and forgave the remaining balance of the Note. A
compensation expense of $540 was recorded as of December 31, 2001.
58 NOTE 12--BORROWINGS Revolving line of credit
We have a line of credit composed of two elements, an accounts receivable line
and an equipment line.
The total amount available under the accounts receivable line of credit is
$11,500. Borrowings under the accounts receivable line of credit will bear
interest either at the lending bank prime rate plus 15% or the LIBOR Option
1,2,3 or 6 month maturity plus 500 basis points. The accounts receivable line
is limited to 80% of eligible accounts receivable. There were no borrowings
outstanding at December 31, 2001 under the accounts receivable line of credit.
Borrowings under our $2,000 equipment line bear interest at the lending bank
prime rate plus 20%. Borrowings outstanding under a previous term facility were
$75 at December 31, 2001.
Our assets collateralize borrowings under both lines of credit. The lines of
credit require us to maintain a minimum quick ratio of 200 to 100, a tangible
net worth of at least $25,000 plus 60% of the proceeds of any public stock
offerings and subordinated debt issuance, and certain other covenants. At
December 31, 2001, we were in compliance with all convenants.
NOTE 13--INCOME TAXES Our provision for income taxes was $200 for the year ended December 31, 2001.
The increase in provision was attributable to taxes on earnings from our foreign
subsidiaries. There was no provision for income taxes in 1999 and 2000 due to
our losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following                           Year Ended December 31,
2000          2001
Net operating loss carryforwards          $  18,952       $  46,673
Accrued expenses and provisions             1,107         1,580
Tax credit carryforwards                1,055         3,938
Deferred Revenue                    9,686         2,438
Depreciation and amortization               19         3,308
Gross deferred tax assets               30,781         57,937
Deferred tax valuation allowance           30,781        57,937
Net deferred tax assets              $    0       $    0
The valuation allowance increased by $8,565, $8,281 and $27,156 for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely
than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on a
number of factors, including the lack of a
59 history of profits, future projected taxable income and the fact that the market
in which we compete is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly
changing technology, we believe that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding
the realization of deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has
been provided. At December 31, 2001, we had approximately $131,200 and $35,200
of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes,
respectively. These carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income
and expire beginning in 2012 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2001, there
are approximately $1,800 of federal credits that begin to expire in 2011. The
California state credits of approximately $1,800 do not expire.
Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and the benefit from net
operating losses that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in
certain circumstances. Events that may cause limitations in the utilization of
net operating losses include a cumulative stock ownership change of more than
50% over a three-year period and other events. We have not yet determined
whether or not operating loss benefits are impaired or limited.
NOTE 14--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We lease our facilities and some equipment under noncancelable operating leases
that expire on various dates through 2011. Rent expense is recognized ratably
over the lease term. Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2001 are
as follows   Year Ending December 31,
2002   $ 3,649
2003    3,493
2004    2,744
2005    1,711
2006    1,900
6,412
$19,909
Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 totaled
$1,438, $1,774 and $3,442, respectively.
NOTE 15--COMMON STOCK During 1999, 2000 and 2001, we repurchased 26, 86 and 127 respectively, shares
of Common Stock at original issuance prices for a total repurchase price of $41 77 and $26, respectively.
NOTE 16--STOCK OPTION PLANS On May 4, 2001, we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our
employees. Under the program, employees were given the opportunity to elect to
cancel outstanding stock options held by them in exchange for an equal number of
new options to be granted six months and a day after the exchange took place at
the then current fair market value. These elections needed to be made by June 6,
2001 and were required to include all options granted during the prior six-month
period. A total of 61 employees elected to participate in the exchange program.
Those 61 employees tendered a total of 801 options to purchase our common stock
in return for our promise to grant new options on the grant date of December 10,
2001. A total of 801 options were granted at the fair market value of $645 per
share on December 10, 2001 to those employees who had been continuously employed
by us from the date they tendered their original options through December 10,
2001. The exchange program was also available to our executive officers and
directors.
Our 1999 Equity Incentive Plan the 1999 Plan provides for the grant to
employees of incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for grants to
60 employees, directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock
purchase rights. Unless terminated sooner, the 1999 Plan will terminate
automatically in 2009. A total of 17,242 shares of Common Stock have been
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Plan. The number of shares reserved under
the plan automatically increases on October 1st of each year by the greater of
1 5% of outstanding shares on that date and 2 the number of shares of common
stock subject to stock awards made under the 1999 Plan during the prior twelve
month period. However, the automatic increase is subject to reduction by the
Board of Directors, and provided further that the automatic increase ceases when
20,000 shares are reserved for issuance pursuant to the 1999 Plan. As of
December 31, 2001, there were 20,000 shares reserved for issuance pursuant to
the 1999 Plan. The 1999 Plan is administered by the Board of Directors, or a
committee of the Board of Directors to which it has delegated this power, and
provides generally that the option price shall not be less than the fair market
value of the shares on the date of grant and that no portion may be exercised
beyond ten years from that date. Under the 1999 Plan, stock options vest over a
period that is limited to five years, but are typically granted with a four-year
vesting period. Each option outstanding under the 1999 Plan may be exercised in
whole or in part at any time. Exercised but unvested shares are subject to
repurchase by us at the initial exercise price. At December 31, 2000 and 2001,
158 and 14 shares were subject to repurchase, respectively.
1999 Non-Employee Director Option Plan
In November 1999, the 1999 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan was adopted
by the Board of Directors and became effective on the date of the initial public
offering. The Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan provides for the automatic
grant of a nonstatutory option to purchase 25 shares of Common Stock to each new
non- employee director who becomes a director after the date of our initial
public offering on the date that such person becomes a director. Each current
and future non-employee director will automatically be granted an additional
nonstatutory option to purchase 8 shares on the day after each of our annual
meetings of the stockholders. Each director who is a member of a board committee
will automatically be granted an additional nonstatutory option to purchase 5
shares on the day after each of our annual meetings of the stockholders. A total
of 765 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under the director
plan. The amount reserved under the 1999 Non-Employee Stock Option Plan
automatically increases on October 1st of each year by the greater of 1 05%
outstanding shares on such date and 2 the number of shares subject to stock
awards made under the director plan during the prior twelve month period.
However, the automatic increase is subject to reduction by the Board of
Directors.
Our Bonus and Salary Conversion Plan the Bonus Plan provides a means by
which selected employees may elect to forego cash bonuses in exchange for fully
vested options to purchase shares of our Common Stock. During the year ended
December 31, 1998, 189 options were granted under the Bonus Plan with exercise
prices ranging from $014 to $040 per share. No options were granted under the
Bonus Plan in 1999, 2000 or 2001. The shares subject to the Bonus Plan shall not
exceed 750.

During the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, we recorded unearned
compensation expense of approximately $11,274, $4,076 and $0, respectively,
related to the issuance of stock options. The amount recorded in the year ended
December 31, 2000 included $2,033 associated with our acquisition of White
Spider described in Note 4. These expenses are being amortized over a period of
four years from the date of issuance using the multiple option approach
prescribed by FIN 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other
Variable Stock Option or Reward Plans. Amortization of unearned compensation
expense related to these options of approximately $2,660, $6,256 and $3,220 was
allocated among cost of net revenues, sales and marketing, research and
development and general and administrative for all periods presented.
Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation awards been determined
based on the minimum value at the grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, our
net loss would have been as follows                           Year Ended December 31,
1999    2000    2001
Net loss:

Pro forma..   $ 449  $ 134  $ 102                    62 Under SFAS No. 123, the minimum value of each option grant is estimated on the
grant date using the following weighted average assumptions                             Year Ended
December 31,

was $079, $690 and $180, respectively.
Because the determination of the fair value of all options granted after we
became a public entity includes an expected volatility factor in addition to the
other factors described in the table above and because additional option grants
are expected to be made each year, the above pro forma disclosures are not
representative of the pro forma effects of option grants on reported results for
future years.
NOTE 17--WARRANTS We issued warrants to Accenture plc to purchase up to 600 shares of common
stock. The warrant will vest based on achieving designated sales targets. As of
December 31, 2001, no warrants had vested. The exercise price is set at $705
per warrant. The warrants expire on September 4, 2006. The warrants will be
valued based on the fair market value of our common stock upon Accenture
achieving the revenue targets and the measured amount will be recorded as sales
and marketing. In conjunction with the Prime Response, Inc. acquisition, we assumed 1,050
warrants issued to Accenture plc and General Atlantic Partners. The warrants
were included as part of the purchase price of Prime Response, Inc. at the date
of the acquisition.
NOTE 18--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 401k Savings Plan
We sponsor a 401k Savings Plan. Under the 401k Plan, employees may elect to
contribute up to 15% of their pre-tax compensation. Chordiant contributions to
the 401k Plan totaled $155, $143, and $358 for the years ended December 31,
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Defined contribution plan
We also sponsor a defined contribution pension plan for the employees of our
United Kingdom sales office. Under the pension plan, employees of the United
Kingdom sales office may elect to contribute 5% of their pre-tax compensation.
Our contributions to the pension plan totaled $123, $312 and $599 for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In November 1999, the 1999 employee stock purchase plan the ESPP was adopted
by the Board of Directors and became effective on February 14, 2000, the date of
our initial public offering. Eligible employees can have up to 15% of their
earnings withheld, to be used to purchase shares of our Common Stock on every
February 15th and August 15th, for a total 24-month term. A new ESPP scheme
commences each 6-month anniversary. An employee may participate in one ESPP
scheme at any one time. The price of the Common Stock purchased under the
Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the commencement date of each six-month offering period or the
specified purchase date. The amount that may be offered pursuant to this plan is
2,673 shares. In 2001, 555 shares were purchased under the ESPP at a weighted
average price of $235. The amount reserved under the plan will automatically
increase each year by the greater of 1 05% outstanding shares on such date
and 2 the number of shares subject to stock awards made under the ESPP during
the prior twelve-month period. However, the automatic increase is subject to
reduction by the Board of Directors.

-  NOTE 20--SUBSEQUENT EVENTS We have entered into a two-year agreement, beginning March 19, 2002, with Merit
International pursuant to which Merit will provide exclusive training and
certain consulting services for a fixed fee. Upon the effective date of this
agreement, we transferred to Merit our training operations including selected
employees. In addition, Merit will provide to our customers resource development
services in exchange for an agreed-upon fee negotiated on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. We feel this agreement will provide us with
high quality training and consulting services. We will pay Merit minimum revenue
targets as follows: January 1, 2002 to June 30, 2002: pound500; July 1, 2002
to December 31, 2002: pound900; January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2002: pound900
July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003: pound1,000; and January 1, 2004 to June 30,
2004: pound500. For a total of pound3,800. The minimum revenue target above
can be reduced for Merit non-compliance with the terms of the agreement. If we
exceed the minimum revenue target, Merit will raise a credit note to be applied
against future minimums. After one year from the effective date, we may, at our
option, terminate the agreement and pay an early termination fee that reduces
from pound555 to pound0 over time. Payment of the early termination fee will
release our obligation related to the minimum revenue target.
On March 28, 2002, we signed an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire
OnDemand, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The closing, which is subject to
contingencies, is anticipated to occur on or about April 1, 2002. In connection
with the merger, the stockholders of OnDemand will receive approximately $12,000
in the aggregate in cash, in exchange for their shares of OnDemand, subject to
certain indemnities and escrow provisions. OnDemand provides relationship
management software and services that enable businesses to increase sales and
reduce costs by maximizing relationships.
