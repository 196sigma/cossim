The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 in accounting for its
employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

511,250 shares of common stock to certain employees and Company advisors. The
exercise price for these options is the initial public offering price of $1150.

granted to advisors from TCR, 45,000 shares granted to advisors from Crow Realty

Company. The options granted to advisors from TCR vested immediately and the

were exercised, forfeited or expired in 1996.

reported in 1996.
