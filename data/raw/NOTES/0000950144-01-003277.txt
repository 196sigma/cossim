NOTE 1. BACKGROUND
On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kimberly-Clark
distributed all of the outstanding common stock of Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc. the Distribution to its stockholders, through a tax-free
spin-off of its U.S., French and Canadian business operations that manufactured
and sold tobacco-related papers and other specialty paper products the
Businesses. Effective at the close of business on November 30, 1995, the
Company became an independent, publicly owned company as a result of the
Distribution.
In order to effectuate the spin-off of the Businesses, on August 21, 1995
and July 31, 1995, respectively, Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. SWM
and Schweitzer-Mauduit Canada, Inc. SM-Canada were incorporated and
nominally capitalized. Prior to the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark transferred to
SWM the Transfer i the assets and liabilities of its U.S.-based specialty
products business; ii all of the issued and outstanding shares of SM-Canada
and of Schweitzer-Mauduit France, S.A.R.L., a French corporation SMF; and
iii 72 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of LTR Industries, S.A., a
French corporation LTRI. After the Transfer, the Company consisted of the
operating assets and liabilities of Kimberly-Clark U.S. specialty products
business and investments in SM-Canada 100 percent owned, SMF 100 percent
owned and LTRI 72 percent owned. SMF, directly or indirectly, then owned 100
percent of two principal French operating subsidiaries, Papeteries de Mauduit
S.A. PdM and Papeteries de Malaucene S.A. PdMal, and a French holding
company, Schweitzer-Mauduit Enterprises S.A. SM-Enterprises. The Transfer
was accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that in pooling of
interests accounting as the entities were all under common control. As used
herein, the Company means SWM, SWM and its several subsidiaries or, as
determined by the context, one or more or its several subsidiaries.
During 1997, the Company established and nominally capitalized
Schweitzer-Mauduit Spain, S.L. SM-Spain, a 100 percent owned holding company
organized under the Spanish holding company regime. During 1998, the Company
transferred its 72 percent interest in LTRI to SM-Spain. During 2000, the
Company transferred its 100 percent interest in SMF to SM-Spain. SM-Spain is the
primary foreign investment holding company for SWM.
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS
On February 2, 1998, SM-Spain paid approximately $620 in cash for 9997
percent ownership interest in Companhia Industrial de Papel Pirahy Pirahy, a
specialty paper manufacturer located near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In connection
with this acquisition, the Company modified its existing credit agreement to
provide a $200 term loan to SM-Spain. SM-Spain borrowed the remaining funds for
the transaction from SMF, which in turn utilized its existing cash balances and
borrowings from its revolving credit facilities. Subsequently, Pirahy was
renamed Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil, S.A. SWM-B. As a result of cumulative
purchases of outstanding minority shares, SM-Spain now owns 9999 percent of the
outstanding shares of SWM-B.
On February 11, 1998, SM-Enterprises paid 372 million French francs then
approximately $61 in cash and assumed approximately $58 in existing net debt
for all of the outstanding shares of Ingefico, S.A. and 971 percent of the
outstanding shares of its pulp and specialty paper manufacturing subsidiaries,
Groupe SAPAM S.A. Groupe SAPAM and Papeteries de la Moulasse S.A., located
in Saint-Girons, France. Subsequently, SM-Enterprises acquired all the remaining
shares of Groupe SAPAM for $02 in cash. SM-Enterprises and Ingefico, S.A. were
then merged into Groupe SAPAM. Papeteries de la Moulasse S.A. was renamed
Papeteries de Saint-Girons S.A. PdStG and Groupe SAPAM was then merged into
PdStG.

The above acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities have been
recorded at their estimated fair values as of the respective dates of the
acquisitions. In conjunction with the acquisitions, liabilities were assumed as
follows                              
Fair value of assets  $ 957
Less: Cash paid for the   683
Direct costs   20
Liabilities  $ 254
The operating results of these acquired companies are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income beginning February 1, 1998. Unaudited
consolidated pro forma net sales and net income for 1998, assuming the
acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of 1998, would have been $5559
and $311, respectively. Unaudited consolidated pro forma basic and diluted
earnings per share for 1998 would have been $194 and $192, the same as the
Company audited consolidated basic and diluted earnings per share.
NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and
liabilities reported, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and amounts of revenues and expenses reported
for the periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. These
financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and include the
accounts of SWM and all its majority-owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany and interdivisional transactions are eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the
customer. Deferred revenue represents advance payments from customers which are
earned based upon a mutually agreed-upon amount per unit of future product
sales.
Foreign Currency Translation
The income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars
at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods. The balance sheets of
these entities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the differences
from historical exchange rates are reflected in a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss as unrealized foreign currency
translation adjustments. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from
settlement of transactions in non-local currencies and remeasurement of
non-local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in
other income, net.
Earnings Per Share
Basic net income per common share is computed based on net income divided
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The average number
of common shares used in the calculation of basic net income per common share
for 2000, 1999 and 1998 were 15,224,100, 15,805,700 and 16,018,700,
respectively. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on net
income divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common
shares outstanding. The average number of common and potential common shares
used in the calculation of diluted net income per common share for 2000, 1999
and 1998 were 15,272,400, 15,807,200 and 16,161,300, respectively. Potential
common shares are those related to

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
stock options and restricted stock outstanding and directors' deferred stock
compensation during the respective years.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits and readily
marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. The
recorded amount reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Inventories
Most U.S. inventories are valued at cost on the Last-In, First-Out LIFO
method. The balance of the U.S. inventories and inventories of entities outside
the United States are valued at the lower of cost, using the First-In, First-Out
FIFO and weighted average methods, or market.
Property and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciable property is
depreciated on the straight-line method for accounting purposes. When property
is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the
transaction is included in income. The depreciable lives for the principal asset
categories are as follows ASSET CATEGORY               DEPRECIABLE LIFE
-                                    
Machinery and Equipment. 5 to 20 years
20 to 40 years
Building  Lesser of 20 years or remaining life of
the relevant building or lease  Capitalized Software Costs
The Company accounts for costs incurred in connection with software
developed for internal use in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use issued in March 1998 by the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The Company
capitalizes certain purchases of software and software design and installation
costs in connection with major projects for software development for internal
use. These costs are included in Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the
consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on the straight-line method for
accounting purposes over the estimated useful life not to exceed seven years.
Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user training, system
start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Environmental Spending
Environmental spending is capitalized if such spending qualifies as
property, plant and equipment, substantially increases the economic value or
extends the useful life of an asset. All other such spending is expensed as
incurred. Environmental spending relating to an existing condition caused by
past operations is expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental
assessments or remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a
feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action.

Impairment of Assets
The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of
long-lived assets based on its expectation of future profitability and
undiscounted cash flow of the related operations. These factors, along with
management plans with respect to the operations, are considered in assessing
the recoverability of property and purchased intangibles.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes have been
provided on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates in effect for the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse.
In France, SMF and its subsidiaries form a consolidated income tax group,
while LTRI separately files its own income tax returns. PdStG joined the
consolidated income tax group of SMF effective January 1, 1999.
Stock Compensation
Compensation cost for stock options is measured based on the intrinsic
value method under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees See
Note 8. Payments in the form of shares of the Company made to third parties,
including the Company outside directors, are recorded at fair value based on
the market value of the Company common stock at the time of payment.
New Accounting Standard
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which will require that all
derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet. In July 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, which delays
the effective date for the new requirements of SFAS No. 133 by one year. As a
result, SFAS No. 133 will be effective for the Company first quarter of 2001.
In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies certain
requirements of SFAS No. 133. The Company adoption of these new accounting
rules is not expected to have a material effect on the Company financial
condition or results of operations.

NOTE 5. DEBT
In 1995, the Company, SMF and PdM Industries S.N.C. PdM Industries, a
subsidiary owned 99 percent by PdM and one percent by SMF, entered into an
unsecured credit agreement the Credit Agreement with a group of banks to
provide term and revolving loans totaling 375 million French francs or
approximately $54 at December 31, 2000 and $57 at December 31, 1999 to SMF and
PdM Industries the French Credit Facility and term and revolving loans
totaling $400 to the Company the U.S. Credit Facility and, together with the
French Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities. The French Credit Facility
consists of a term loan to SMF in the amount of 250 million French francs or
approximately $36 at December 31, 2000 and $38 at December 31, 1999 the
French Term Loan Facility and a renewable 364-day revolving credit facility
available to both SMF and PdM Industries in an amount of up to 125 million
French francs or approximately $18 at December 31, 2000 and $19 at December 31,
1999 the French Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the French
Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company. The U.S. Credit Facility consists
of a term loan to the Company in the amount of $250 the U.S. Term Loan
Facility, and, together with the French Term Loan Facility, the Term Loan
Facilities and a renewable 364-day revolving credit facility available to the
Company in an amount of up to $150 the U.S. Revolving Credit Facility and,
together with the French Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit

Facilities. In connection with the Distribution, the Company made cash
distributions to Kimberly-Clark principally financed by borrowings of the full
amounts by SWM and SMF under the Term Loan Facilities.
In February 1998, the Company completed the Brazilian and French
acquisitions see Note 2. In anticipation of these acquisitions, the Company
modified its then existing Credit Agreement. The terms of the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement entered into on January 30, 1998 were substantially
the same as the prior Credit Agreement, except that it i provided an
additional $200 term loan to SM-Spain adding it to the Term Loan Facilities,
which has subsequently been transferred to SWM in the United States, ii
extended the maturities of the Term Loan Facilities by approximately two years,
and iii renewed the Revolving Credit Facilities. The Revolving Credit
Facilities have subsequently been renewed annually, most recently in January
2001, now with an expiration date of January 25, 2002. Loans under each of the
Term Loan Facilities are payable in three equal semi-annual installments
beginning in January 2002, however the Company currently intends to refinance
such loans prior to the semiannual installment payment dates.
The interest rate under the U.S. Term Loan Facility is based, at the
election of the Company, on either a the sum of i either 0375 percent per
annum or 0300 percent per annum the Applicable Margin, determined by
reference to the Company Leverage Ratio as defined in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement plus ii the London interbank offered rate for U.S.
dollar deposits LIBOR, or b an alternate base rate. After the most recent
amendment to the Credit Facilities in January 2001, the interest rate under the
French Term Loan Facility is based on the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the
euro zone interbank offered rate for euro deposits EURIBOR. Beginning
January 26, 2001, the interest rates under the U.S. and French Revolving Credit
Facilities are determined using the same formula for the respective Term Loan
Facility except that the Applicable Margin is 0900 percent per annum.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains representations and
warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and covenants and
provisions that, among other things, require the Company maintain certain
defined financial ratios a minimum Tangible Net Worth, a maximum Leverage Ratio
and a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, all as defined in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement. Events of default under the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement include, among other things, termination of the Company
supply agreement with Philip Morris without entry into one or more suitable
replacement agreements.
The Company selectively enters into interest rate hedge agreements with
respect to its variable rate long-term borrowings under the Credit Facilities to
manage its exposure to interest rate increases when it is practicable and
cost-effective to do so. The weighted average effective interest rates on the
Term Loan Facilities for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were
57 percent, 45 percent and 51 percent, respectively.
At both December 31, 2000 and 1999, long-term debt other than the Term Loan
Facilities primarily consisted of obligations of the French operations related
to government-mandated profit sharing. These amounts bear interest at the
five-year treasury note rate in France 60 percent at both December 31, 2000
and 1999 and are generally payable in the fifth year subsequent to the year the
profit sharing is accrued.

At December 31, 2000, the U.S. and French operations of the Company
together had approximately $33 of Revolving Credit Facilities available, all of
which was unused. These facilities permit borrowing at competitive interest
rates and are available for general corporate purposes. The Company pays
commitment fees on the unused portion of these Revolving Credit Facilities at an
annual rate of 200 percent and may cancel the facilities without penalty at any
time prior to their expiration at January 25, 2002.
The Company also had other bank credit facilities available totaling
approximately $27, of which $20 was outstanding at December 31, 2000. No
commitment fees are paid on the unused portion of these facilities.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the estimated fair value of the Company
long-term debt and short-term debt approximated the carrying amount. These fair
values were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt or on
current rates offered to the Company for obligations with the same maturities.

The provision for income taxes in 2000 was impacted by a decrease in the
French corporate income tax rate from 400 percent for 1999 to 377 percent for
2000 and a decline in the Brazilian corporate income tax rate from 370 percent
for most of 1999 to 340 percent for most of 2000. Changes in French tax law
enacted in December 2000 will reduce the French corporate income tax rate from
377 percent for 2000 to 363 percent for 2001 and 353 percent for 2002 and
thereafter. The effect of this enacted change in the French corporate income tax
rate had a nominal favorable effect on the deferred income tax provision in 2000
related to the net balances of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.
Additionally, the provision for income taxes in 2000 was impacted by several
items, including a favorable adjustment to reduce Spanish deferred income tax
valuation allowances, favorable income tax treatment of a settlement related to
a prior-period claim and an equity-related payment from Brazil and income tax
benefits associated with treatment of certain repatriations during
38

the year. Excluding the effects of these four items, the effective income tax
rate for 2000 would have been 370 percent.
The provision for income taxes in 1999 was impacted by an increase in the
effective statutory income tax rate enacted in France in December 1999 for years
beginning in 2000 from the scheduled rate of 367 percent to 377 percent. The
favorable effect of $02 on the deferred provision for income taxes was due to
the increased value of deferred income tax assets, primarily attributable to the
tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards NOLs of the SMF tax group
estimated to be realizable in future years, net of the increased value of
deferred income tax liabilities.
The provision for income taxes in 1998 included the benefit of a reduction
in the valuation allowance recorded against certain French deferred income tax
assets arising from NOLs. This adjustment reduced the deferred provision for
income taxes by $52. The reduction in the valuation allowance was recorded
because of continued earnings and projected future earnings at the French
businesses that utilize the NOLs, reducing the uncertainty that these NOLs would
be fully utilized in the future.
The Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or plans to repatriate such earnings
only when tax-effective to do so. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and
state income taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in
the form of dividends, loans to the U.S. parent, or otherwise, the Company could
be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. Determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practicable
because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.
Deferred income tax assets liabilities as of December 31, 2000 and 1999
were comprised of the following                                2000   1999

In the above presentation, for 2000, the net noncurrent deferred income tax
asset relates to the Spanish tax jurisdiction and the net noncurrent deferred
income tax liability relates to the U.S., Canadian, French and Brazilian tax
jurisdictions. In the above presentation, for 1999, the net noncurrent deferred
income tax asset relates to the French, Brazilian and Spanish tax jurisdictions,
and the net noncurrent deferred income tax liability relates to the U.S. and
Canadian tax jurisdictions. Total deferred income tax assets were $440 and
$467 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Total deferred income tax
liabilities were $531 and $488 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Under French tax law, NOLs incurred through December 31, 1994 by SMF
subsidiaries unrelated to the Businesses, which were distributed to
Kimberly-Clark prior to the Distribution, were retained by SMF as of January 1,
1995. In addition to SMF remaining NOLs, NOLs were obtained in the acquisition
of Pirahy and were generated during 1998 by SWM-B, during 1998 through 2000 by
SM-Spain and during 2000 in the United States. The Company elected to include
PdStG, acquired in February 1998, in the SMF consolidated tax group beginning
January 1, 1999.

Under current tax laws governing the tax jurisdictions in which the Company
has NOLs, remaining NOLs in France and Brazil carry forward indefinitely, NOLs
in Spain expire the later of ten years subsequent to the year generated or ten
years subsequent to the first year of taxable income in Spain which was 2000,
and NOLs in the United States carry forward 20 years. Of the $1061 of NOLs
still available at December 31, 2000, $48 will expire in 2010 if not utilized
against taxable income in Spain and $51 will expire in 2020 if not utilized
against taxable income in the United States. The remaining $962 of NOLs have no
expiration date. Valuation allowances totaled $102 as of December 31, 2000,
reducing the related net deferred tax asset to an amount which is estimated to
be realizable through utilization of the NOLs. Although realization is not
assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred
tax asset will be realized. However, that amount could change if, among other
considerations, estimates of future taxable income or income tax regulations or
interpretations change during the carryforward periods.
In addition to the NOLs above, the Company has generated foreign tax
credits in excess of the amount of foreign tax credits utilized in its U.S.
federal income tax returns and federal alternative minimum tax
40
41
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
AMT credits. The amount of cumulative excess foreign tax credits through its
U.S. federal income tax return for the year ended December 31, 1999, the most
recent year filed, totaled $16. These credits carry forward five years from the
date generated, however, because the Company does not currently foresee being
able to realize the benefit of these credits prior to their expiration, the
assets are fully reserved with a valuation allowance of $16. The Company
federal AMT credits, related to its filed 1999 and prior year tax returns, carry
forward indefinitely and totaled $05 at December 31, 2000.
Along with numerous other companies and banks in France, PdM is subject to
a tax claim with respect to its purchase of certain bonds in 1988 which were
represented by the two selling banks as carrying specific tax benefits. The
French taxing authority is challenging the use by PdM of those benefits. In
1999, the French taxing authority reduced its claim against PdM to exclude an
abuse of law penalty and to include instead a bad faith penalty. In November
2000, the Administrative Court of Rennes rendered a decision granting PdM relief
of the bad faith penalty but maintaining the principal and interest portions
of the claim. The total claim by the French taxing authority, excluding the bad
faith penalty was $06 as of December 31, 2000, including interest. PdM
adjusted accrued liability related to this exposure as of December 31, 2000 was
$06. PdM will appeal this most recent decision with respect to its maintaining
the principal and interest portions of the claim. The Company will continue to
vigorously defend the claim based on the merits and has filed claims against
each selling bank on the basis of their misrepresentation of certain facts. The
Company claim against one of the banks was rejected by a trial court in 1996
and the Company appealed this decision. In 1997, the case against the other bank
was stayed until the claim filed by the French taxing authority against PdM has
been resolved. Since the claim against PdM by the French taxing authority
relates to a period prior to PdM joining the consolidated tax group, any
unfavorable outcome could not be offset with the NOLs of the SMF consolidated
tax group. Based on information currently available, there exists a reasonable
possibility of an unfavorable outcome for this claim, however PdM negative
exposure is now fully reserved.
NOTE 7. POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS
North American Pension Benefits
In connection with the Distribution, retirees of the Company U.S. and
Canadian businesses prior to the Distribution remained participants of their
respective Kimberly-Clark plans. Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company and
its subsidiary in Canada established defined benefit retirement plans covering
substantially all full-time employees. Retirement benefits were based on years
of service and generally on the average compensation earned in the highest five
of the last 15 years of service. Employees as of the date of the Distribution
retained credit for prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark.
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company amended its defined benefit retirement
plan for U.S. employees to include a cash balance benefit formula that covers
all salaried employees hired on or after July 1, 2000 and all salaried employees
as of July 1, 2000, except those salaried employees who were grandfathered and
chose to retain retirement benefits under the terms of the plan prior to this
amendment. Salaried employees who, as of July 1, 2000, had either attained the
sum of their age plus years of vesting service equal to 65 or more, or attained
the sum of their age plus years of vesting service equal to 60 or more and had
at least 15 years of vesting service were grandfathered under the plan and could
elect either the new cash balance benefit formula or to retain retirement
benefits under the terms of the plan prior to this amendment. For employees
under the cash balance formula, the Company will annually credit to the
employee account balance a retirement contribution credit, which is a
percentage of the employee earnings with the percentage varying based on the
years of vesting service in the plan, and an interest credit, based on the
average yield for 30-year treasury bills.
The Company funding policy is to contribute assets that, at a minimum,
fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation, subject to regulatory and tax
deductibility limits. Under the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark was required to
transfer a proportionate share of assets of its plans related to the employees
who transferred to
41

the Company in the Distribution. The plan assets for the U.S. and Canadian plans
were transferred during 1997 from the Kimberly-Clark plans, in which the
employees had participated prior to the Distribution, to the Company plans
upon receiving favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service
and Revenue Canada, respectively, qualifying the Company plans. Plan assets
are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity and debt
securities.
The components of net pension expense for U.S. employees for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were as follows                                2000  1999  1998

The projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation for a
U.S. supplemental executive pension plan with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $19 and $17, respectively, as of December 31, 2000,
and $17 and $14, respectively, as of December 31, 1999. This particular plan
is unfunded and therefore has no plan assets.
French Pension Benefits
In France, employees are covered under a government administered program.
In addition, the Company French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans
which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to employees who retire from the
Company. The Company French operations also sponsor a supplemental executive
pension plan which is designed to provide a retirement benefit equal to between
50 and 65 percent of final earnings, depending upon years of service, after
considering other government and Company sponsored retirement plans. Plan assets
are principally invested in the general asset portfolio of a French insurance
company.
The Company net pension expense for the French pension plans was $17 15 and $16 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The assumed long-term rates of return on pension assets for
purposes of pension expense recognition for the French plans were 45 percent
for 2000, 65 percent for 1999 and 70 percent for 1998. Transition adjustments
for these plans are being amortized on the straight-line method over 19 to 20
years. The discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation and
accumulated benefit obligation for the French plans were 60 percent and 55
percent at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The assumed long-term rates
of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligation for
these plans were 25 percent at both December 31, 2000 and 1999.
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair
value of plan assets for the French pension plans were $163, $86 and $57,
respectively, as of December 31, 2000, and $143, $72 and $35, respectively,
as of December 31, 1999. The Company net accrued pension liability for the
French plans was $39 and $53 at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Brazilian Pension Benefits
In Brazil, employees are covered under a government administered program.
Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits
In connection with the Distribution, retirees of the Company U.S. and
Canadian businesses prior to the Distribution remained participants of their
respective Kimberly-Clark plans. Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company and
its subsidiary in Canada established unfunded healthcare and life insurance
benefit plans which will cover substantially all future retirees of the Company.
Eligibility for benefits under the Company plans is based on years of service
and age at retirement. Employees as of the date of the Distribution retained
credit for prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark. The Company plans
are noncontributory for certain long service employees when they retire, but are
contributory for most other future retirees.
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company amended its postretirement healthcare
and group life insurance coverages for U.S. salaried employees, except certain
grandfathered employees. Grandfathered employees will continue to receive
retiree healthcare coverage and life insurance coverage at rates subsidized by
the Company. For all other U.S. salaried employees, future retiree healthcare
coverage access will be offered at full cost to the retiree.

For purposes of measuring the benefit obligation at December 31, 2000, a
65 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health
care benefits was assumed for 2001. The rate was assumed to decrease to 50
percent for 2002 and remain at that level thereafter. For purposes of measuring
the benefit obligation at December 31, 1999, a 55 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for
2000 and thereafter. Discount rates of 75 percent and 80 percent were used to
determine the postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
A one-percentage point increase or decrease in the healthcare cost trend
rate would have a nominal effect on the total of the service and interest cost
components of the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2000. A one
percentage point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the
total postretirement benefit obligation by $01 at December 31, 2000. Likewise,
a one percentage point decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate would decrease
the total postretirement benefit obligation by $01 at December 31, 2000.
Other Benefits
Substantially all U.S. employees have been given the opportunity to
participate in a voluntary retirement savings plan. Under the plan, the Company
matches a portion of employee contributions. The Company cost

under the plan reflected in the accompanying consolidated income statements was
$09 for both 2000 and 1999, and $10 for 1998. At December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, 500,000 shares of the Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance
under the plan, none of which had been issued as of December 31, 2000. The
shares may, at the Company option, be used to satisfy the Company liability
for its matching contributions.
Beginning in 2000, the Company also provides U.S. executives, certain other
key personnel and its directors the opportunity to participate in deferred
compensation plans. Those participating employees can elect to defer a portion
of their salaries and certain other compensation. Those participating directors
can elect to defer their meeting fees, as a cash deferral, as well as their
quarterly retainer fees, as deferred stock unit credits. The Company liability
under these plans totaled approximately $05 at December 31, 2000, which is
included on the consolidated balance sheet in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. In
connection with these plans, as well as the Company supplemental executive
retirement and executive severance plans, the Company also established a grantor
trust during 2000 into which the Company contributed funds toward its future
obligations under the various plans. Grantor trust investments are primarily in
company-owned life insurance policies. Grantor trust assets totaled $05 at
December 31, 2000, which are included in Other Assets on the consolidated
balance sheet.
NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to
100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $10 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock, par value $10 per share. Each share of presently
outstanding Common Stock and each share of Common Stock issued after the date of
this report will have attached to it, one right to purchase from the Company one
one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of a series of Preferred Stock designated as
the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock the Series A Preferred
Stock a Right. Each Right entitles a shareholder to purchase from the
Company one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock at
a price of $65 per one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share, subject to certain
anti-dilution adjustments. The Rights, however, become exercisable only at such
time as a person or group acquires, or commences a public tender or exchange
offer for, 15 percent or more of the Company Common Stock. The Rights have
certain anti-takeover effects since they may cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by
the Company Board of Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any
merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors since
they may be redeemed by the Company at $01 per Right at any time until a person
or group has obtained beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting
stock. The Rights will expire at the close of business on October 1, 2010,
unless redeemed earlier by the Company.
The Series A Preferred Stock will be non-redeemable and, unless otherwise
provided in connection with the creation of a subsequent series of preferred
stock, will be subordinate to any other series of the Company preferred stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive when, as and
if declared, a quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $1 per
share or 100 times the cash dividends declared on the Company Common Stock. In
addition, the Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 100 times any non-cash
dividends other than dividends payable in shares of Common Stock or a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock declared on the Common
Stock, in like kind. In the event of a liquidation, the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation payment in an amount
equal to the greater of $100 per share or 100 times the payment made per share
of Common Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will have 100 votes,
voting together with the Common Stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation
or other transaction in which common shares are exchanged, each share of Series
A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per
share of Common Stock. The rights of the Series A Preferred Stock as to
dividends, liquidation and voting are protected by antidilution provisions.

The Company Equity Participation Plan provides that eligible employees
may be granted stock options which, when exercised, give the recipient the right
to purchase the Company Common Stock at a price no less than the fair market
value as defined in the Equity Participation Plan of such stock at grant
date. Options awarded under the Equity Participation Plan only become
exercisable after specified periods of employment after the grant thereof 30
percent after the first year, 30 percent after the second year and the remaining
40 percent after the third year. Generally, such options expire ten years
subsequent to the date of grant.
SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation defines a fair value
based method of accounting for stock compensation, including stock options, to
employees. This statement provides entities a choice of recognizing related
compensation expense by adopting the fair value method or to measure
compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25. The Company has elected to continue to measure
compensation cost for stock compensation based on the intrinsic value method
under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Payments in the
form of shares of the Company made to third parties, including the Company
outside Directors, are recorded at fair value based on the market value of the
Company common stock at the time of payment. Under APB No. 25, because the
exercise price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price
of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is
recognized. SFAS No. 123 requires presentation of pro forma net income and
earnings per share as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
compensation under the fair value method of that statement. For purposes of the
pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the stock compensation is
amortized to expense over the vesting period. Under the fair value method, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have been the pro forma
amounts indicated below                                2000  1999  1998

estimated volatility over the ten year option term of 30 percent for the 2000
awards, 27 percent for the 1999 awards and 24 percent for the 1998 awards, a
risk-free rate of return based upon the zero coupon government bond yield and an
assumed quarterly dividend of $015 per share. At both December 31, 2000 and
1999, 1,500,000 shares of the Company Common Stock were reserved under the
Equity Participation Plan. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, there were 261,360 and

Effective December 2, 1999, the Company established a Restricted Stock Plan
which is intended to promote the long-term financial success of the Company by
attracting to the Company and retaining outstanding executive personnel and to
motivate such personnel by means of restricted stock grants. The Compensation
Committee of the Company Board of Directors selects participants and
establishes the terms of any grant of restricted stock. The Company Restricted
Stock Plan provides that such a grant immediately transfers ownership rights in
shares of the Company Common Stock to the recipient of the grant, including
the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends thereon, at a share price
established by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. The recipient
continued ownership of and right to freely transfer the restricted stock is
subject to such conditions on transferability and to such risks of forfeiture as
are established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, which may
include continued employment with the Company for a defined period, achievement
of specified management performance objectives or other conditions established
by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares which may be issued under
this Restricted Stock Plan is limited to the lesser of 200,000 shares or the
number of treasury shares held by the Company as of the date of any grant. No
single participant may be awarded, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent of the
shares authorized to be issued under the Restricted Stock Plan. As of December
31, 2000, 30,000 restricted shares had been issued under the Restricted Stock
Plan which will not vest until four years of service from the date of the grant.
The number of shares available for future awards is limited, as of December 31,

NOTE 9. FOREIGN CURRENCY
Foreign currency losses have arisen from settlement of transactions in
non-local currencies and the remeasurement of non-local currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the
operation is domiciled. Such losses included in other income, net were $06 in
2000 and were nominal in 1999 and 1998.
Foreign currency risks arise from transactions and commitments denominated
in non-local currencies. These transactions and commitments may include the
purchase of inventories or property, plant and equipment, the sale of products
and the repayment of loans.
Management selectively hedges the Company foreign currency risks when it
is practicable and cost effective to do so. The instruments are purchased from
well-known money center banks, insurance companies or government agencies
counterparties. Usually the contracts extend for no more than 12 months,
although their contractual term has been as long as 24 months. Credit risks with
respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be
hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the
contracts, are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties.
Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm commitments are deferred
and included in the basis of the underlying hedged items. Premiums paid for
options are amortized ratably over the life of the option. All other gains and
losses are included in period income or expense based on the period-end market
price of the instrument.
At December 31, 2000, there were outstanding forward contracts, which were
held for purposes other than trading, maturing at various dates in 2001, to
purchase $92 of various foreign currencies. These contracts have not given rise
to any significant net deferred gains or losses as of December 31, 2000.
NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS
Operating Leases
Future minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an
initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 2000 are less
than $1 annually over the next five years. Rental expense under operating leases
was $40, $43 and $51 for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Other Commitments
During 1998, PdM entered into a 10 year agreement with one of its vendors
in connection with PdM purchases of calcium carbonate, a raw material used in
the manufacturing of some paper products. The vendor agreed to construct and
operate an on-site plant at the Quimperle, France mill. The cost to construct
the necessary building and equipment was approximately $7. PdM agreed to annual
minimum purchase commitments at prices which will vary according to quantities
consumed. If PdM buys less than the minimum purchase commitments, the vendor can
terminate the contract and require PdM to pay to the vendor the then net book
value of the building and equipment, determined using a straight-line method of
depreciation over the life of the agreement.
Similarly, a vendor of SWM-B operates a calcium carbonate plant on-site at
the Pirahy, Brazil mill. Under that agreement, which will expire in 2006, the
net raw material prices vary according to the quantities produced, however,
SWM-B is committed to pay at least the monthly fixed costs of the calcium
carbonate plant which are less than $01 per month.
48
49
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Under each of the above agreements, the net raw material prices expected to
be paid are less than the net prices at which the raw material could otherwise
be purchased, and thus the commitments are not expected to result in losses.
Additionally, PdM and SWM-B current levels of calcium carbonate usage exceed
their respective contractual minimum commitments.
The Company enters into certain other immaterial contracts from time to
time for the purchase of certain raw materials. The Company also enters into
certain contracts for the purchase of equipment and related costs in connection
with its ongoing capital projects which, at December 31, 2000, totaled
approximately $139.
NOTE 11. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On December 27, 2000, SWM-B received two assessments from the tax
authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil concerning Imposto sobre
Circulacao de Mercadorias e Servicos ICMS, a form of value-added tax,
consisting of unpaid ICMS taxes from January 1995 through November 2000,
together with interest and penalties in the total amount of approximately $136,
based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December 31, 2000 the
Assessment. The Assessment concerned the accrual and use by SWM-B of ICMS tax
credits generated from the production and sale of certain non-tobacco related
grades of paper sold domestically that are immune from the tax to offset ICMS
taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not immune. A portion of
the Assessment, estimated at approximately $69, relates to tax periods that
predate the Company acquisition of Pirahy, the predecessor in name to SWM-B,
and is covered by an indemnification from the sellers of Pirahy. SWM-B is
vigorously contesting the Assessment on both procedural and constitutional
grounds and believes that the Assessment will ultimately be resolved in its
favor. However, the final resolution of this matter will most likely entail both
administrative and judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the
matter to the Supreme Court of Brazil and is not likely to be finally resolved
for several years. No liability has been recorded in the Company financial
statements for the Assessment. Pending final resolution of this matter,
beginning in December 2000, SWM-B suspended the further accrual and application
of ICMS tax credits generated on immune products to reduce its possible exposure
to future ICMS tax assessments. A reserve of $11 was recorded for the entire
asset balance of unused ICMS tax credits as of December 31, 2000.
The Company is involved in certain other legal actions and claims arising
in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that such litigation and
claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 12. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company operations are subject to federal, state and local laws,
regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental matters. The nature
of the Company operations expose it to the risk of claims with respect to
environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or
liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. Based on the
Company experience to date, the Company believes that its future cost of
compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure
to liability for environmental claims and its obligation to participate in the
remediation or the monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or
results of operations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws
and regulations, or unknown contamination of sites owned, operated or used for
waste disposal by the Company including contamination caused by prior owners
and operators of such sites or other waste generators may give rise to
additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition or results of operations.
The Company is a party to an administrative consent order with the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection MDEP governing the
post-closure care of the Willow Hill Landfill in Lee,

Massachusetts. The consent order required the Company to perform certain
remedial measures and to reduce the concentration of landfill gases to specified
levels at all monitoring points by September 15, 1998, or the Company could be
liable for stipulated penalties. Results of monitoring tests conducted in
October 2000 and thereafter show that the Company has reduced the concentration
of landfill gases at all monitoring points to the levels specified in the
consent order. MDEP previously advised the Company informally that stipulated
penalties would not be assessed based on a delay in complying with the consent
order because of the Company ongoing efforts to resolve the issue and no
sanctions have been imposed to date. The Company must continue bimonthly
monitoring and remain in compliance at all monitoring points for twelve months.
Costs of these measures were previously accrued and are not material. The
Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on
the Company business or financial condition.
At Distribution, the Company assumed Kimberly-Clark liabilities as a
potentially responsible party PRP under the provisions of the U.S.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and
analogous New Jersey statutes in connection with the Global Landfill Reclaiming
Corporation Global Landfill waste disposal site in Old Bridge, New Jersey.
The Company continues to participate in the remediation of the Global Landfill
as a member of a group of PRPs that entered into a consent decree with the state
of New Jersey in 1993. The Company previously recorded its pro-rata portion of
the estimated liability for remediation of this site, the remainder of which is
not material.
The Company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at the Company
facilities in the United States, France, Brazil and Canada. For these purposes,
the Company incurred total capital expenditures of $12 in 2000, and anticipates
that it will incur approximately $2 to $3 annually in 2001 and 2002. The major
projects included in these estimates include upgrading wastewater treatment
facilities at various locations and installation of ink solvent treatment
equipment in France. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to
reduce the Company ability to invest in capacity expansion, quality
improvements, capital replacements, productivity improvements or cost
containment projects, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial condition or results of operations.
NOTE 13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHY
Business Segment Reporting
The Company is operated and managed based on the geographical location of
its manufacturing operations: the United States, France and Brazil. These
business segments manufacture and sell cigarette, plug wrap and tipping papers,
used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco products and
paper products used in cigarette packaging, primarily to the tobacco industry.
While the products are comparable in each segment, they vary based on the
technological capabilities of each of the manufacturing operations and the
respective markets and customers served. Sales by a segment into markets
primarily served by a different segment occur where specific product needs
cannot be cost-effectively met by the manufacturing operations domiciled in that
segment.
Tobacco industry products comprised 88 to 90 percent of the Company
consolidated net sales in each of the years 2000, 1999 and 1998. The Company
non-tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products, certain of which
represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine utilization.
Consolidated Operations by Segment
For purposes of the segment disclosure in the following tables, the term
United States includes operations in the United States and Canada. The
Canadian operations only produce flax fiber used as raw material in the U.S.
operations. The Company Brazilian operations acquired on February 2, 1998 and
the

operations of the French business acquired on February 11, 1998 are included in
the Company consolidated financial statements since the beginning of February
1998.
Intercompany sales of products between segments are made at market prices
and are referred to as intersegment items. Expense amounts not associated with
segments are referred to as unallocated items. Assets reported by segment
represent assets which are directly used and an allocated portion of jointly
used assets. These assets include receivables from other segments and are
included in eliminations.                            NET SALES       OPERATING PROFIT    TOTAL ASSETS

NOTE 14. MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Two of the Company customers have accounted for a significant portion of
the Company net sales in the periods presented in the financial statements,
and the loss of one or both such customers, or a significant reduction in one or
both of these customers' purchases, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company results of operations. Net sales to Philip Morris Incorporated
Philip Morris, together with its affiliates and designated converters,
accounted for approximately 30 percent of total consolidated net sales for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, and approximately 28 percent for 1998.
Net sales to B.A.T. Industries PLC BAT, together with its affiliates and
designated converters, accounted for approximately 17 percent, 18 percent and 14
percent of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively. Each of the Company segments reported sales to these
customers for each of the respective periods reported above.
The Company had sales to the minority shareholder of LTRI of $191, $242
and $168 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The Company consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 2000 and
1999 included balances from Philip Morris and BAT, together with their
respective affiliates and designated converters. The percentage of these
customers' balances of consolidated accounts receivable is less than each of
their respective percentages of consolidated net sales.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on all of its customers'
financial condition and generally does not require collateral or other security
to support customer receivables. A substantial portion of the Company
consolidated accounts receivable are due from companies in the tobacco industry
which has been and continues to be under substantial pressure from legal,
regulatory and tax developments. It is not possible to predict the outcome of
such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future
litigation, regulatory actions and additional taxes may have on the tobacco
industry, its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers. Nor is it
possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to
tobacco products will be enacted, or to what extent, if any, such legislation or
regulations might affect the tobacco products industry in general.

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Schweitzer-Mauduit International,
Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. is responsible for
conducting all aspects of the business, including the preparation of the
financial statements in this Annual Report. The financial statements have been
prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America considered appropriate in the circumstances to present fairly the
Company consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows
on a consistent basis. Management also has prepared the other information in
this Annual Report and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the
financial statements.
As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some
financial statement amounts are based on management estimates and judgments.
Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to
provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial
information contained in this Annual Report. These measures include an effective
control-oriented environment in which a company-wide internal control program
plays an important role, an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors which
oversees the financial reporting process, and independent audits. As part of
that responsibility, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors
the selection of the Company independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP.
One characteristic of a control-oriented environment is a system of
internal control over financial reporting and over safeguarding of assets
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition, designed to provide
reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding
preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset
safeguarding. The system is supported with written policies and procedures and
contains self-monitoring mechanisms. Appropriate actions are taken by management
to correct deficiencies as they are identified. All internal control systems
have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and
overriding of controls, and therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance as
to financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding. Management
believes the Company system of internal control maintains an appropriate
cost-benefit relationship.
The Company has also adopted a code of conduct which, among other things,
contains policies for conducting business affairs in a lawful and ethical manner
in each country in which it does business, for avoiding potential conflicts of
interest, and for preserving confidentiality of information and business ideas.
Internal controls have been implemented to provide reasonable assurance that the
code of conduct is followed.
The financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP. During
their audits, the independent auditors were given unrestricted access to all
financial records and related data. Management believes that all representations
made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.
During the audits conducted by the independent auditors, management
received minor recommendations to strengthen or modify internal controls in
response to developments and changes. Management has adopted, or is in the
process of adopting, all recommendations which are cost-effective. s/ Wayne H. Deitrich
