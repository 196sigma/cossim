ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in
stockholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in Item
14a of the Form 10-K presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company management: our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company has current debt which is due
and payable in 2000 and also has significant future capital commitments that
raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business and Organization  Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc. Pacific Gateway or the Company, a
Delaware corporation, owns and operates an international switched and domestic
switched telecommunications network. The operations of Pacific Gateway include
wholesale and retail long distance, Internet, and bandwidth services.
The Company is subject to various risks in connection with the operation of
its business. These risks include, but are not limited to, changes in
government regulation, dependence on transmission facilities-based carriers
and suppliers, price competition, and competition from larger industry
participants.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had $541 million outstanding under its
$100 million credit facility. As discussed in Note 8 Debt and Note 16
Subsequent Events, this credit facility must be reduced to $50 million on
May 15, 2000, and the remainder is due and payable in November, 2000. At March
30, 2000, the Company had $756 million unaudited outstanding on its $100
million line of credit. Also as discussed in the Note 10 - Commitments and
Contingencies the Company has approximately $145 million in capital
commitments due in the next twelve months. The Company will require additional
funding in order to meet these commitments and continue operations in the
normal course of business. Historically, the Company has funded its operations
primarily through positive operating cash flows. Management plans to pursue
additional equity from new or existing investors, debt financing, or asset
sales to refinance current outstanding debt, and fund future capital
commitments. There is no assurance that management will complete its plans.
Principles of Consolidation  Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pacific Gateway
and its majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries in Bermuda, the United
Kingdom, Russia, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Germany, and Cyprus. The
Company accounts for investments in 20% to 50%-owned companies and
partnerships using the equity method. Intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.
49             PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Foreign Currency Translation  Assets and liabilities of operations outside the United States, for which
the functional currency is not U.S. dollars, are translated into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rate in effect at each period end. Revenues and expenses
are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the period. The
effects of foreign currency translation adjustments arising from differences
in exchange rates from period to period are deferred and included as a
component of Stockholders' Equity.
For operations in highly-inflationary economies, principally in Russia,
assets and liabilities are maintained in the reporting currency, U.S. dollars.
The effects of foreign currency transactions, and of remeasuring the
financial position and results of operations in the functional currency, are
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.
Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The fair value of financial instruments, consisting of cash, cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and the line of credit, is
based on interest rates available to the Company and comparisons to quoted
prices. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair value of these financial
instruments approximates carrying value.
Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had bank deposits in excess of
federally insured limits of $194 million and $229 million respectively. The
Company customer base includes domestic and international companies in the
telecommunications industry. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers, but generally does not require collateral to support
customer receivables. The Company allowance for doubtful accounts is based
on current market conditions. Losses on uncollectible accounts have
consistently been within management expectations.
For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company derived 11% of its
revenues from a single customer of $644 million. For the year ended December
31, 1998, there were no major customers that comprised ten percent or more of
the Company revenues. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company
derived 10% of its revenues from a single customer of $310 million.
Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under
SFAS No. 109, the Company recognizes current and
50             PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon all events that have
been recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of
the enacted tax laws.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the estimated amount to be realized. Income tax expense represents
the tax payable for the current period and the change during the period in the
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are
expensed as incurred. Replacements and betterments are capitalized. The
Company classifies costs incurred in connection with the construction of new
property and equipment, including labor, as construction in progress until the
property and equipment becomes operational. The Company capitalized $53
million and $32 million of direct labor and associated overhead in 1999 and
1998, respectively, exclusive of software development costs, discussed below.
The Company capitalized no labor or overhead costs in 1997. In addition, the
Company capitalizes the interest costs that relate to network and facility
construction per SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. The Company
capitalized $21 million of interest in 1999. The Company capitalized no
interest in 1998 or 1997. When the property and equipment becomes operational,
the Company places it in service and depreciates it using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives. The cost and related accumulated
depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the account balance
and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in results of operations.
The Company invests in undersea fiber optic cable systems through the
purchase of indefeasible rights of use IRU or through an ownership
interest in cable construction consortia.
Software Development Costs  In accordance with Statement of Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the
Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company
capitalizes certain costs related to its software developed for internal use
for which it has no plans to market externally. The Company amortizes
capitalized costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of
the asset, which is between four and seven years. The Company adopted SOP 98-1
in 1998 and capitalized $40 million and $15 million in 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Intangible Assets  Intangible assets primarily include amounts allocated upon acquisitions of
businesses of the excess purchase price over the tangible assets acquired.
These assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period
of benefit. Intangibles are amortized over periods that do not exceed 10
years.
Costs associated with potential acquisitions are initially deferred. When an
acquisition closes, the Company capitalizes the related costs as part of the
purchase price of the assets acquired. For those acquisitions that are not
completed, the Company expenses related costs in the period in which the
related acquisition is abandoned.
Debt Issuance Costs  Debt issuance costs are included in other current assets and are being
amortized over the terms of the related debt.                    51             PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Accounting for Business Combinations  The Company generally records contingent payments as additional purchase
price and amortizes the payments over the estimated remaining useful life of
the acquired assets.
Long-Lived Assets  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
of, requires that long-lived assets and certain intangible assets be reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. If undiscounted expected future cash
flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, then an impairment loss
is to be recognized based on the fair value of the assets. No impairment
losses have been recognized to date.
Revenue Recognition  Revenues for telecommunications and Internet services provided to customers
are recognized as services are rendered. Revenues for return traffic received
according to the terms of the Company operating agreements with its foreign
partners are recognized as revenue as the return traffic is received. Revenue
attributable to leases of bandwidth fiber optic capacity pursuant to IRUs
that qualify for sales-type lease accounting and were entered into prior to
June 30, 1999, are generally recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance
of the fiber optic capacity by the lessee. Bandwidth fiber capacity IRU that
do not meet the criteria for sales-type lease accounting are accounted for as
operating leases and revenue is recognized over the term of the lease.
The Company bandwidth fiber capacity agreements generally require the
customer to make a down payment due upon execution of the agreement with the
balance due upon delivery and acceptance of the fiber. Amounts billed or cash
received in excess of revenue earned are recorded as deferred revenue.
The Company is obliged under its bandwidth capacity fiber agreements to
maintain its network in efficient working order and in accordance with
industry standards. The lessee is obligated for the term of the agreement to
pay operating and maintenance costs. The Company recognizes this revenue as
services are provided.
For bandwidth fiber capacity agreements entered into prior to June 30, 1999,
the Company determined the cost of revenue based on an allocation of the total
estimated costs of the network to the fiber optic cable sold. The allocation
takes into account the service capacity of the specific fiber optic capacity
sold relative to the total expected capacity of the network.
The Company is recognizing revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 43, Real Estate Sales, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 66 FIN 43 and the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. However, accounting practice and
guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of bandwidth sales is
evolving. Any changes in the accounting treatment could affect how the Company
accounts for future bandwidth sales.
Accounting for International Long Distance Traffic  The Company has entered into operating agreements with 44 telecommunications
carriers in 28 countries under which international long distance traffic is
both delivered and received. Under these agreements, the foreign carriers are
contractually obligated to adhere to the policy of the Federal Communications
Commission the FCC, whereby traffic from the foreign country is routed to
international carriers, such as the Company                    52             PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
in the same proportion as traffic carried into the country. Mutually exchanged
traffic between the Company and foreign carriers is settled through a formal
settlement policy that generally extends over a six-month period at an agreed
upon rate. The Company records the amount due to the foreign partner as an
expense in the period the traffic is delivered. Of the 44 agreements the
Company had at December 31, 1999, 18 agreements provided that the Company
generally must wait up to six months before it actually receives the
proportional return traffic. In circumstances where the Company does not
receive the return traffic due from the foreign partner at the end of the
agreed-upon delayed return period, the Company and the foreign partner may
agree to a settlement that compensates the Company for the return traffic not
received, through greater return traffic in future periods, or a reduction to
the Company current accounts payable balance.
Earnings Per Share  In accordance with SFAS No. 128, basic earnings per share is calculated by

2 Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial
instruments and hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure
those instruments at fair value. To date, the Company does not currently hold
any derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities. The
Company expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not have a material
impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. The
Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001.
In June 1999, the FASB issued FIN 43. Under FIN 43, fiber optic cable is
considered integral equipment and accordingly, a lease must include a
provision allowing title to transfer to the lessee in order for that lease to
be accounted for as a sales-type lease. FIN 43 applies to leases of integral
equipment entered into after June 30, 1999.
In November 1999, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100,
Restructuring and Impairment Charges SAB 100. SAB 100 provides
interpretive guidance on how companies should account for and disclose certain
expenses that are commonly reported in connection with exit activities and
business combinations. SAB 100 also addresses contingent liabilities assumed
in a purchase business combination and inventory valuation allowances. SAB 100
must be applied to the financial statements for financial years ending
December 31, 1999. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SAB 100
will have a material affect on its financial results.
In December 1999, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB 101. SAB 101 provides
interpretive guidance on the recognition, presentation, and disclosure of
revenue in the financial statements. SAB 101 must be applied to the financial
statements no later than the second quarter of 2000. The Company does not
believe that the adoption of SAB 101 will have a material affect on its
financial results.

13 Employee Benefit Plans
In September 1995, the Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan which is intended to qualify under section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Purchase Plan was not active for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998, or 1997. Under the Purchase Plan, the Company
reserved up to 400,000 shares of common stock for purchase by employees who
meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute up to
10% of their compensation to the Purchase Plan to purchase shares at 85% of
the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of each six-month
offering period as defined in the Purchase Plan.
The Company maintains a 401k plan pursuant to which eligible employees may
accumulate savings on a tax-deferred basis. Each year the Company may make a
discretionary profit sharing contribution to the 401k plan which will be
allocated to the accounts of eligible employees who are employed on the last
day of the year. The profit sharing allocation is made on a pro rata basis in
proportion to the compensation of the eligible employees. The Company did not
make a contribution in 1999, 1998, or 1997.
14 Stock Option Plan
In September 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995
Plan. The 1995 Plan provided non-qualified and incentive stock options to
purchase up to 1,200,000 shares of common stock. Options granted under the
1995 Plan generally vested over four years. The maximum term of options
granted was ten years. The Company granted options to purchase 883,411 shares
of common stock under the 1995 Plan.
In February 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan the
1997 Plan, replacing the 1995 Plan. The 1997 Plan provided for non-
qualified and incentive stock option awards, stock appreciation rights, stock
grants, and stock-based performance units. The Company may award 4,500,000
shares under the 1997 Plan; with respect to stock option and stock
appreciation right awards, no more than 500,000 shares may be awarded to any
one individual in any one-year period. The remaining terms of the 1997 Plan
are similar to those described in the 1995 Plan. In July 1999, shareholders
voted to increase the number of shares available
64             PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
under the plan to 4,500,000 shares from 4,000,000 shares. In addition, the
Company Board of Directors approved the 1997 Supplemental Long-Term
Incentive Plan the 1997 Supplemental Plan with 2,500,000 shares. The 1997
Supplemental Plan provides non-qualified stock options to non-officer
employees. In January 2000, the Company Board of Directors increased the
number of shares available under the 1997 Supplemental Plan to 4,500,000
shares.
In September 1998, the Company repriced 768,500 options to purchase the
Company common stock granted under the 1997 plan to $27688 per share, the
fair market value of the Company common stock on September 18, 1998.
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, encourages adoption
of a fair value-based method for valuing the cost of stock-based compensation.
However, it allows companies to continue to use the intrinsic value method
prescribed under Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Options Issued to Employees, for options granted to
employees and disclose pro froma net income and earnings per share in
accordance with SFAS No. 123. Had compensation cost for the Company stock-
based compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have been as follows                       Year Ended December 31,

Expected  5 years 5 years 5 years  SFAS No. 123 requires that stock-based compensation granted to non-employees
be accounted for based on the fair value-based method described above. It also
requires that restricted stock granted to employees be recognized as
compensation expense over the vesting period, measured at the fair market
value on the grant date. In 1999, 1998, and 1997, the Company granted 66,750,
25,000, and 75,000 shares, respectively, of restricted stock under the 1997
Plan. In 1999, the Company also granted 150,000 stock options at prices below
market value at the date of the grant. The Company recorded deferred
compensation of $45 million, $10 million, and $41 million for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. This amount was
recorded as a reduction of stockholders' equity and is being amortized as an
expense to operations over the applicable vesting periods. For the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, $12 million, $07 million, and $01
