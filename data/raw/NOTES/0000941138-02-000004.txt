ITEM 8. - CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
- 
See Item 14, page 106, for a list of the Consolidated Financial
Statements that are included in the following pages. See Note 18 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         Report of Independent Accountants To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
UniSource Energy Corporation and to the
Board of Directors and Stockholder of
Tucson Electric Power Company
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed
in the index appearing under Item 14a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UniSource
Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company and
Tucson Electric Power Company and its subsidiaries TEP at
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14
a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company and TEP management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company and TEP changed their method of
accounting for derivative instruments as of January 1, 2001. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Second Mortgage IDBs are backed by LOCs under TEP Credit Agreement. TEP
obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized with Second Mortgage
Bonds. The LOCs expire on December 30, 2002. If the LOCs are not extended or
replaced with new LOCs with a longer term or if the bonds are not otherwise
refinanced, the bonds would be redeemed. Accordingly, these IDBs were
classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2001, and will be classified as
long-term debt once a new LOC facility with a later expiration date is obtained. Weighted average interest rates on variable rate tax-exempt debt IDBs
ranged from 140% to 502% during 2001 and 2000, and the average interest rate
on such debt was 267% in 2001 and 417% in 2000.
UniSource Energy also has stock options outstanding. See Note 13.

UniSource Energy is the holder of all but 120 shares of TEP outstanding
common stock. There are 46 million outstanding TEP warrants which entitle the holder of
five warrants to purchase one share of TEP common stock for $1600. See Note 15. Second Mortgage IDBs are backed by LOCs under TEP Credit Agreement. TEP
obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized with Second Mortgage
Bonds. The LOCs expire on December 30, 2002. If the LOCs are not extended or
replaced with new LOCs with a longer term or if the bonds are not otherwise
refinanced, the bonds would be redeemed. Accordingly, these IDBs were
classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2001, and will be classified as
long-term debt once a new LOC facility with a later expiration date is obtained. Weighted average interest rates on variable rate tax-exempt debt IDBs
ranged from 140% to 502% during 2001 and 2000, and the average interest rate
on such debt was 267% in 2001 and 417% in 2000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- 
NOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- 
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
UniSource Energy Corporation UniSource Energy is an exempt holding
company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. UniSource Energy
has no significant operations of its own, but holds the stock of Tucson
Electric Power Company TEP, Millennium Energy Holdings, Inc. Millennium and
UniSource Energy Development Company UED. TEP, a regulated public utility
incorporated in Arizona since 1963, is UniSource Energy largest operating
subsidiary and represents substantially all of UniSource Energy assets.
Millennium holds the energy-related businesses described in Note 4 and UED
services are described in Note 5.
TEP generates, transmits and distributes electricity. TEP serves retail
customers in a 1,155 square mile area in Southern Arizona. TEP also sells
electricity to other utilities and power marketing entities primarily located
in the Western United States. Approximately 60% of TEP work force is subject
to a collective bargaining unit. The collective bargaining agreement in place
at December 31, 2001 terminates on January 6, 2003.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On January 1, 1998, TEP and UniSource Energy exchanged all the outstanding
common stock of TEP on a share-for-share basis for the common stock of
UniSource Energy. Following the share exchange, in January 1998 TEP
transferred the stock of Millennium to UniSource Energy for a $95 million ten-
year promissory note. Approximately $25 million of this note represents a gain
to TEP. TEP has not recorded this gain. Instead, this gain will be reflected
as an increase in TEP common stock equity when UniSource Energy pays the
principal portion of the note in 2008. In accordance with the Arizona
Corporation Commission ACC order authorizing the formation of the holding
company, the note bears interest at 978% payable every two years beginning
January 1, 2000. UniSource Energy paid TEP $9 million in each of 2001 and 2000
and $19 million in 1999 for the interest owed under this note.
UniSource Energy and TEP use the following two methods to report
investments in their subsidiaries or other companies   - Consolidation: When we own a majority of the voting stock of a
subsidiary, we combine the accounts of the subsidiary with our accounts and
eliminate intercompany balances and transactions.
- The Equity Method: We use the equity method to report corporate joint
ventures, partnerships, and affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50%
voting interest or we have the ability to exercise significant influence over
the operating and financial policies of the investee company. Under the equity
method, we report    - Our interest in the equity of an entity as an investment on our
balance sheet; and
- Our percentage share of the net income loss from the entity as Other
Income in our income statements. For investments where we provide all of the
financing, we recognize 100% of the losses.
USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial
statements under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP. These
estimates and assumptions affect   - A portion of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates
of the financial statements;
- Our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities at the dates
of the financial statements; and
- A portion of the reported revenues and expenses during the financial
statement reporting periods.
Because these estimates involve judgments, the actual amounts may differ
from the estimates.
REGULATION
The ACC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC regulate
portions of TEP utility accounting practices and electricity rates. The ACC
has authority over certain rates charged to retail customers, the issuance of
securities, and transactions with affiliated parties. The FERC regulates TEP
rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services. TEP generally uses
the same accounting policies and practices used by unregulated companies for
financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes these principles, such as
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation FAS 71, require special accounting treatment
for regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. These effects are
described in Note 2.
TEP UTILITY PLANT
We report TEP utility plant on our balance sheets at its original cost.
Utility plant includes   - Material and labor,
- Contractor costs,
- Construction overhead costs where applicable, and
- An Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC or capitalized
interest.
AFUDC reflects the cost of financing construction projects with borrowed
funds and equity funds. The component of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds
is included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on the income statement.
The equity component is included in Other Income. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, we
imputed the cost of capital on construction expenditures at an average of
846%, 764% and 704%, respectively, to reflect the cost of using borrowed and
equity funds to finance construction.
On November 1, 1999, after we stopped applying FAS 71 to our generation
operations, we began applying Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. This statement replaces the previous
AFUDC calculation for generation-related construction projects and provides
guidance on calculating the costs during construction of debt funds used to
finance these projects. The capitalized interest on our generation-related
construction projects is included as a reduction of Other Interest Expense on
the income statement. The average capitalized interest rate applied to
generation-related construction expenditures was 493% and 558% in 2001 and
2000, respectively.
Depreciation
We compute depreciation for owned utility plant on a straight-line basis
at rates based on the economic lives of the assets. These rates are approved
by the ACC and averaged 388%, 385% and 368% in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The economic lives for generation plant are based on remaining
lives. The economic lives for transmission plant, distribution plant, general
plant and intangible plant are based on average lives. The rates also reflect
estimated removal costs, net of estimated salvage value. The costs of planned
major maintenance activities are accounted for as the costs are actually
incurred and are not accrued in advance of the planned maintenance. Planned
major maintenance activities include the scheduled overhauls at our generation
plants. Minor replacements and repairs are expensed as incurred. Retirements
of utility plant, together with removal costs less salvage, are charged to
accumulated depreciation.
MILLENNIUM AND UED PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT
Millennium and UED properties and equipment are included, net of
accumulated depreciation, in UniSource Energy balance sheets in the
Investments and Other Property line item. Properties and equipment are stated
at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are
charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and betterments are
capitalized.
Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of major
equipment at Global Solar Energy, Inc. Global Solar. The capitalized
interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is
depreciated over the asset estimated useful life.
UED capitalizes project development costs because it is probable that the
project will be completed and we expect to recover the costs of the project.
These costs include dedicated employee salaries, professional services and
other third party costs. Capitalized project costs would be immediately
charged to expense if we determine that the project is impaired.
TEP UTILITY PLANT UNDER CAPITAL LEASES
TEP financed the following generation assets with leases   - Springerville Common Facilities,
- Springerville Unit 1,
- Springerville Coal Handling Facilities, and
- Irvington Unit 4.
Under GAAP, these leases qualify as capital leases. However, for ACC rate-
making purposes, these leases have been treated as operating leases with
recovery as if rent payments were made in equal amounts annually during the
lease term. We recorded capital lease expense interest and depreciation on a
basis which reflected the rate-making treatment for periods prior to November
1, 1999, the date our generation operations became deregulated. We deferred
the differences between GAAP capital lease accounting used by unregulated
companies and the ACC rate-making method used by us prior to November 1, 1999.
See Income Statement Impact of Applying FAS 71 in Note 2. We describe the
lease terms in Capital Lease Obligations in Note 7.
The following table shows the amount of lease expense incurred for TEP
generation-related capital leases                           Years Ended December 31,
2001   2000  1999
-Millions of Dollars-

Total Lease Expense              $119   $122  $116
LONG-TERM DEBT
We defer all costs related to the issuance of long-term debt. These
costs include underwriters' commissions, discounts or premiums, and other
costs such as legal, accounting and regulatory fees and printing costs. We
amortize these costs over the life of the debt.
Prior to November 1, 1999, gains and losses on debt that we retired
before maturity were amortized over the remaining original life of the debt to
interest expense. Effective November 1, 1999, we recognize gains and losses
on reacquired debt associated with the generation portion of TEP operations
as incurred. We reclassified any remaining generation-related unamortized
gains and losses on reacquired debt at November 1, 1999, which had been
included in Other Regulatory Assets in our balance sheets, to the Transition
Recovery Asset. See Note 2. We continue to defer and amortize the gains and
losses on reacquired debt associated with TEP regulated operations to
interest income or expense over the remaining life of the original debt.
ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES
We record electric utility operating revenues when we deliver electricity
to customers. Operating revenues include unbilled revenues which are earned
service has been provided but not billed by the end of an accounting period.
We record an expense and reduce accounts receivable by an Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts for revenue amounts that we estimate will become
uncollectible. The Allowance for Doubtful Accounts was $9 million and $10
million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. See Note 11 for further
discussion of TEP wholesale accounts receivable and allowances.
REVENUE FROM LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS
UniSource Energy income statements have included Global Solar long-
term contract revenue in Other Operating Revenues since Global Solar was
consolidated on June 1, 2000. Global Solar recognized long-term contract
revenue of $2 million in 2001, $4 million in 2000 and $4 million in 1999.
Global Solar recognized total annual research and development expense of $7
million in 2001 and 2000 and $5 million in 1999. These expenses include both
costs associated with revenue producing contracts and internal development
costs. Global Solar derives much of its revenue from funding received under
research and development contracts with various U.S. governmental agencies.
Revenues on these contracts are recognized as follows   - Cost Reimbursement Contracts - Revenue is recognized as costs are
incurred;
- Cost Plus Fixed Fee Contracts - Revenues are recognized using the
percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs
incurred to date to total contract costs; and
- Fixed Fee Contracts - Revenues are recognized when applicable
milestones are met.
Contract costs include direct material, direct labor and overhead costs.
FUEL COSTS
Fuel inventory, primarily coal, is recorded at weighted average cost.
TEP uses full absorption costing. Under full absorption costing, all costs
incurred in the production process are included in the cost of the inventory.
Examples of these costs are direct material, direct labor and overhead costs.
INCOME TAXES
We are required by GAAP to report some of our assets and liabilities
differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes.
The tax effects of differences in these items are reported as deferred income
tax assets or liabilities in our balance sheets. We measure these assets and
liabilities using income tax rates that are currently in effect.
We allocate income taxes to the subsidiaries based on their taxable
income and deductions used in the consolidated tax return.
EMISSION ALLOWANCES
Emission Allowances are issued by the Environmental Protection Agency
EPA and each permits emission of one ton of sulfur dioxide SO2. These
allowances can be bought or sold. Prior to November 1, 1999, based on
expected future regulatory treatment, TEP recorded Emission Allowance
purchases in a noncurrent inventory account included in Investments and Other
Property on the balance sheets. Emission Allowance inventory was recorded at
weighted average cost. Gains on sales of Emission Allowances were deferred as
an Emission Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability in the balance sheets. At
November 1, 1999, the Emission Allowance inventory account and the Emission
Allowance Gain Regulatory Liability were written off and the result was
included in Extraordinary Income in the income statements. See Note 2.
Subsequent to November 1, 1999, TEP Emission Allowances have a zero book
value. In 2001 and 2000, we utilized a portion of TEP Emission Allowances
to comply with environmental regulations. See Note 10.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued the
following Statements of Financial Accounting Standards FAS   - FAS 141, Business Combinations, which addresses the accounting and
reporting for business combinations. FAS 141 requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using one method,
the purchase method. The adoption of FAS 141 did not have a significant
impact on our financial statements.
- FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which addresses how
intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other
assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted
for in financial statements upon their acquisition. FAS 142 also addresses
how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they
have been initially recognized in the financial statements. We are required
to comply with FAS 142 beginning January 1, 2002. The adoption of FAS 142 did
not have a significant impact on our financial statements.
- FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which requires
entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is
initially recorded, the entity should capitalize a cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is
accreted to its present value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over
the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an
entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain
or loss upon settlement. We are required to comply with FAS 143 beginning
January 1, 2003. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of
FAS 143 on our financial statements.
- FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, which provides guidance on the financial accounting and reporting for
the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed
of. FAS 144 supersedes the current authoritative literature for the
impairment of long-lived assets and for the disposal of a segment of a
business. We are required to comply with FAS 144 beginning January 1, 2002.
The adoption of FAS 144 did not have a significant impact on our financial
statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
We consolidated Income Taxes into a single line item, which is presented
below Income Before Income Taxes, Extraordinary Item and Cumulative Effect of
Accounting Change. Income Taxes were previously included in Operating Expenses
and Other Income Deductions. We have reclassified prior year income
statements to conform to this presentation. We have made other
reclassifications to the prior year financial statements for comparative
purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on net income. NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS
-    TEP generally uses the same accounting policies and practices used by
unregulated companies for financial reporting under GAAP. However, sometimes
these principles, such as FAS 71, require special accounting treatment for
regulated companies to show the effect of regulation. For example, in setting
TEP retail rates, the ACC may not allow TEP to currently charge its customers
to recover certain expenses, but instead requires that these expenses be
charged to customers in the future. In this situation, FAS 71 requires that
TEP defer these items and show them as regulatory assets on the balance sheet
until TEP is allowed to charge its customers. TEP then amortizes these items
as expense to the income statement as those charges are recovered from
customers. Similarly, certain revenue items may be deferred as regulatory
liabilities, which are also eventually amortized to the income statement as
rates to customers are reduced.
The conditions a regulated company must satisfy to apply the accounting
policies and practices of FAS 71 include   - an independent regulator sets rates;
- the regulator sets the rates to recover specific costs of delivering
service; and
- the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below
the rates set by the regulator.
TEP applied FAS 71 to the generation, transmission and distribution
portions of its business prior to the November 1999 ACC approval of the
Settlement Agreement see below. Included in the regulatory assets and
liabilities at December 31, 1998 was the Springerville Unit 1 Allowance for
$171 million. This allowance represented the portion of Springerville Unit 1
non-fuel expenses that the ACC did not allow TEP to recover through retail
rates. The allowance, a contra-asset account, increased by interest expense
which was shown as Interest Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value in the
Interest Expense section in the income statements and decreased by the
Amortization of Springerville Unit 1 Allowance, which was a contra-expense
included in Operating Expenses.
At November 1, 1999, the unamortized balance of the Springerville Unit 1
Allowance reduced the Springerville Unit 1 capital lease asset amount. This
offset reduced the amount of post-FAS 71 Springerville Unit 1 lease
depreciation expense that will be recognized in the income statements and
eliminated any further interest and amortization expense related to the
Springerville Unit 1 Allowance.
NOVEMBER 1999 ACC APPROVAL OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
The Settlement Agreement
In November 1999, the ACC approved a Settlement Agreement between TEP and
certain customer groups relating to recovery of TEP transition costs and
standard retail rates. The major provisions of the Settlement Agreement, as
approved, were   - Consumer choice: Consumer choice for energy supply began in January
2000 and by January 1, 2001 consumer choice was available to all customers.
- Rate freeze: In accordance with the Rate Settlement approved by the ACC
in 1998, TEP decreased rates to retail customers by 11% on July 1, 1998, 1%
on July 1, 1999 and 1% on July 1, 2000. These reductions applied to all
retail customers except for certain customers that have negotiated non-
standard rates. The Settlement Agreement provides that, after these
reductions, TEP retail rates will be frozen until December 31, 2008, except
under certain circumstances. TEP expects to recover the costs of transmission
and distribution under regulated unbundled rates both during and after the
rate freeze.
- Recovery of transition costs: TEP frozen rates include Fixed and
Floating Competition Transition Charge CTC components designated for the
recovery of transition costs, including generation-related regulatory assets
and a portion of TEP generation plant assets. Retail rates will decrease by
the Fixed CTC amount after TEP has recovered $450 million or on December 31,
2008, whichever occurs first. The Floating CTC equals the amount of the frozen
retail rate less the price of retail electric service. The price of retail
electric service includes TEP transmission and distribution charge and a
market energy component based on a market index for electric energy. Because
TEP total retail rate will be frozen, the Floating CTC is expected to allow
TEP to recoup the balance of transition recovery assets not otherwise
recovered through the Fixed CTC. The Floating CTC will end no later than
December 31, 2008.
- General rate case: TEP will be required to file by June 1, 2004 a
general rate case including an updated cost-of-service study. Any rate change
resulting from this rate case would be effective no sooner than June 1, 2005
and would not result in a net rate increase.
The Settlement Agreement requires TEP to transfer its generation and
other competitive assets to a wholly-owned subsidiary by December 31, 2002.
Also under the Settlement Agreement, TEP, as a utility distribution company
UDC, would acquire energy in the wholesale market for its retail customer
energy requirements. The Settlement Agreement also requires that by December
31, 2002 the UDC must acquire at least 50% of its requirements through a
competitive bidding process, while the remainder may be purchased under
contracts with TEP generation subsidiary or other energy suppliers. The
amounts the UDC acquires through competitive bids may be purchased under
bilateral contracts or spot market purchases with third parties, or
potentially with TEP generation subsidiary. Under the ACC electric
competition rules, TEP will be required to provide energy to any distribution
customer who does not choose another energy service provider. TEP
generation subsidiary will sell energy into the wholesale market. On January
28, 2002, we filed with the ACC a request for an extension to meet the
requirements of the Settlement Agreement until the latter of December 31, 2003
or six months after the ACC has issued a final order in the current docket
pertaining to electric restructuring issues.
Extraordinary Item
Effective November 1, 1999, we stopped applying FAS 71 to our generation
operations and we recognized $23 million in extraordinary income, net of tax,
primarily as a result of recognition of deferred investment tax credits. In
accordance with previous actions of the ACC, TEP had deferred recognition of
the benefit of approximately $31 million in investment tax credits. These
benefits were recognized as part of the discontinuation of FAS 71 as we no
longer had a regulatory deferral requirement. This gain was partially offset
by approximately $14 million in generation-related costs for which TEP did not
receive regulatory recovery as part of its Transition Recovery Asset. These
costs included approximately $11 million of generation-related property taxes
and approximately $3 million of net deferred losses related to the sale of
Emission Allowances. We recorded a net tax benefit of $6 million related to
the write-off of these costs.
Income Statement Changes Resulting from Deregulation of Generation
Operations
As a result of the deregulation of our generation operations, many costs
in the UniSource Energy and TEP income statements are reflected in different
line items in 2001 and 2000 than they were in 1999. The primary differences
are   - In 2001 and 2000, amortization of our capital lease assets and interest
related to Capital Leases are reflected in Depreciation and Amortization and
Interest on Capital Leases, respectively. Through October 1999, these
expenses were included as Capital Lease Expense.
- Amortization of Springerville Unit 1 Allowance and the related Interest
Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value are no longer presented in 2001
and 2000. In November 1999, the unamortized balance of the Springerville Unit
1 Allowance reduced the Springerville Unit 1 capital lease amount.
- Amortization of Transition Recovery Asset appears as an expense
beginning in November 1999.
- Amortization of Investment Tax Credit ITC no longer contributes to
Income Tax Expense in 2001 and 2000. All ITC was recognized in November 1999.
Transition Recovery Asset
The Transition Recovery Asset consists of generation-related regulatory
assets and a portion of TEP generation plant asset costs. The Total
Transition Costs Being Recovered through the Fixed CTC were amortized as
follows                            Years Ended December 31,

Remaining Transition Recovery Asset on the
balance sheet, end of year              $ 332    $ 353
The Generation-Related Plant Assets are included in Plant in Service on
the balance sheet. The unamortized balance of such generation-related costs
totaled $36 million at December 31, 2001. The Excess Capacity Deferrals are
not reflected on our balance sheet and relate to operating and capital costs
associated with Springerville Unit 2 capacity which were previously expensed
when incurred. Prior to discontinuation of application of FAS 71, these costs
were amortized as an off-balance sheet regulatory asset. The unamortized
balance of the off-balance sheet excess capacity deferral totaled $18 million
at December 31, 2001.
The remaining Transition Recovery Asset balance will be amortized as
costs are recovered through rates until TEP has recovered $450 million of
transition costs or until December 31, 2008, whichever comes first.
REGULATORY ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000
The balances of regulatory assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000 are noted
in the table below. There are no remaining regulatory liabilities recorded on
the balance sheets at December 31, 2001 and 2000. All of the remaining
regulatory assets relate to TEP distribution and transmission business.

INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF APPLYING FAS 71
The amortization of the regulatory assets discussed in the previous
sections of this note have had the following effect on our income statements                            Years Ended December 31,
2001  2000  1999

If TEP had not applied FAS 71 in these years, the above amounts would
have been reflected in the income statements in prior periods. The above
table does not include capital lease expense. Capital lease expense would
have been recognized at different annual amounts if TEP had not applied FAS 71
although the total would be the same over the life of the leases. Lease
expense included on our income statements amounted to $116 million in 1999.
If we had not applied FAS 71, the Springerville Unit 1 Allowance would have
been offset against the Springerville Unit 1 capital lease asset and the
depreciation would have been calculated on a straight-line method. Our lease
expense would have been $124 million in 1999 if we had not applied FAS 71.
The reclassification of our generation-related regulatory assets to the
Transition Recovery Asset shortened the amortization period for these assets
to nine years.
FUTURE IMPLICATIONS OF CEASING TO APPLY FAS 71 TO OUR REGULATED BUSINESS
We continue to apply FAS 71 for the distribution and transmission
portions of TEP business, our regulated operations. We periodically assess
whether we can continue to apply FAS 71. If we stopped applying FAS 71 to
TEP remaining regulated operations, we would write off the related balances
of TEP regulatory assets as a charge in our income statement. Based on the
balances of TEP regulatory assets at December 31, 2001, if we had stopped
applying FAS 71 to TEP remaining regulated operations, we would have
recorded an extraordinary loss, after-tax, of approximately $245 million.
While regulatory orders and market conditions may affect our cash flows, our
cash flows would not be affected if we stopped applying FAS 71 unless a
regulatory order limited our ability to recover the cost of that regulatory
asset.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ARIZONA REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
In February 2002, the ACC consolidated several pending matters related to
retail electric competition in order to make a comprehensive reexamination of
the Rules.
In a letter dated January 14, 2002, ACC Chairman William A. Mundell
suggested the following possible outcomes to the proceedings   - Implementation of the Rules according to the existing schedule,
- Delayed implementation of the Rules to provide an opportunity to
consider the extent to which Rule modification and variance is in the public
interest, including changing the direction to retail electric competition, or
- Step back from electric restructuring until the Commission is convinced
that there exists a viable competitive wholesale electric market to support
retail electric competition in Arizona.
To begin the proceedings, the ACC sent a list of questions related to
retail competition to Arizona electric utilities, requesting responses by
February 25, 2002. The Chairman further stated that an Open Meeting, with
opportunity for public comment, may be set. We are uncertain what the outcome
of this proceeding will be. NOTE 3. ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
- 
In 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133 FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
A derivative financial instrument or other contract derives its value from
another investment or designated benchmark.
There are two types of gains and losses related to contracts:
- An unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the market price
of the commodity at any time before the contract is settled and the specified
contract price. The market prices used to determine fair value for forward
contracts are estimated based on various factors including broker quotes,
exchange prices, over the counter prices and time value.
- A realized gain or loss is the difference between the specified
contract price and the actual cost of the commodity that was purchased or sold
at the settlement date.
FAS 133 requires us to recognize derivative instruments on the balance
sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value and to record the
related unrealized gains and losses throughout the contract period until
settlement. Because of the complexity of derivatives, the FASB established a
Derivatives Implementation Group DIG. During 2001, the DIG issued new
guidance which changed the contracts that qualified as derivatives under FAS
133.
INITIAL ADOPTION
When we adopted FAS 133 on January 1, 2001, we examined all of our
contracts and determined that some of the forward contracts that we used to
buy and sell wholesale power were considered to be derivatives based on the
accounting guidance at that time.
TEP has the following types of wholesale energy activity   1 Sales of firm capacity and energy under long-term contracts for
periods of more than one year.
2 Under forward contracts, TEP commits to purchase or sell a specified
amount of capacity or energy at a specified price over a given period of time,
typically for one month, three months or one year, within established limits
to take advantage of favorable market opportunities.
3 Short-term economy energy sales in the daily or hourly markets at
fluctuating spot market prices and other non-firm energy sales.
4 Sales of transmission service.
Based on our interpretation of FAS 133 and other guidance, we classified
our contracts as follows Contract Type                Normal    Cash
Purchases   Flow    Trading
and Sales   Hedge    Activity
- 
Coal purchase contracts, supplies and
equipment purchase contracts, debt
agreements and all other non-wholesale
energy contracts              X
- 
Wholesale Energy Contracts  - Long-Term Contracts            X
- 
- Forward Contracts
-   - Off-peak                X
- 
- On-peak* forward purchase contracts to
meet our retail and firm commitments        X
- 
- On-peak* forward sales contracts of our
excess system capacity               X
- 
- All other forward contracts                    X
- 
- Short-Term Sales             X
- 
- Transmission Sales            X
-  On-peak purchases and sales occur daily from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., Monday
through Saturday.
The accounting treatment for the various classifications are as follows   - Normal Purchases and Sales: The contracts that qualify as normal
purchases and sales are excluded from the requirements of FAS 133. The
realized gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the income
statement at the contract settlement date.
- Cash Flow Hedge: The unrealized gains and losses related to these
forward contracts are included in Other Comprehensive Income, a component of
stockholders' equity. As the forward contracts are settled, the realized
gains and losses are recorded on the income statement as a component of
operating revenues and the unrealized gains and losses are reversed from Other
Comprehensive Income.
- Trading Activity: The unrealized gains and losses related to these
forward contracts are reflected in the income statement as a component of
operating revenues. As the forward contracts are settled, the realized gains
or losses are recorded and the unrealized gains and losses are reversed.
We recorded the cumulative effects of adopting FAS 133 as of January 1,
2001, as follows.  The financial statements for periods prior to 2001 do not
reflect the requirements of FAS 133, as we recorded realized gains and losses
at the contract settlement date.
- Income Statement: after-tax unrealized gain of $470,000.
- Balance Sheet:
- Other Comprehensive Income, a component of stockholders' equity:
after-tax unrealized loss of $14 million, and
- Forward Sale and Purchase Contracts Liability of $22 million.
NEW ACTIVITY DURING 2001
In May 2001, we entered into two swap agreements to hedge our risk of
fluctuations in the market price of gas related to approximately a third of
our anticipated gas purchases from June through October 2001. These swaps
were considered derivatives and were designated as cash flow hedges.
Beginning November 2001, Millennium Environmental Group, Inc. MEG, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennium, began operations and entered into swap
agreements and forward contracts relating to SO2 Emission Allowances. These
activities are considered to be trading activities. In 2001, we recorded a
pre-tax unrealized loss of less than $01 million related to MEG activities.
NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE DURING 2001
In June 2001, the DIG issued guidance which provided that certain forward
power purchase or sales agreements, including capacity contracts, could be
excluded from the requirements of FAS 133. We implemented this new guidance,
on a prospective basis, beginning July 1, 2001. As a result, we determined
the cash flow hedge items certain forward contracts but not the gas swap
agreements could be excluded from the FAS 133 requirements. We did not
reverse the unrealized gains losses related to the cash flow hedges in June.
Instead, because all the contracts were settled by December 31, 2001, as the
contracts settled we:
- reversed the unrealized gain loss included in Other Comprehensive
Income; and
- recorded the realized gain loss in the income statement.
On December 19, 2001, the FASB approved revisions to clarify the
qualifying criteria outlined in FAS 133 Implementation Issue No. C15 Issue
C15, Scope Exceptions: Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Option-
Type Contracts and Forward Contracts in Electricity. The revised guidance
will go into effect on April 1, 2002, on a prospective basis. We are
currently in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the revisions to
Issue C15 on our financial statements.
To date, the DIG has issued more than 100 interpretations to provide
guidance in applying FAS 133. As the DIG or the FASB continues to issue
interpretations, we may change the conclusions that we have reached and, as a
result, the accounting treatment and financial statement impact could change
in the future.
NOTE 4. MILLENNIUM ENERGY BUSINESSES
- 
See Note 5 for selected financial data of Millennium.
ENERGY TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS
Millennium owns 67% of the following entities and their financial
statements are consolidated into the Millennium and UniSource Energy financial
statements. A privately held company owns the remaining 33%.
- Global Solar is a developer and manufacturer of flexible thin-film
photovoltaic cells. Global Solar began limited production of photovoltaic
cells in 1999. Target markets for its products include military, space and
commercial applications.
Prior to June 1, 2000, Millennium owned 50% of Global Solar and
reported Global Solar results of operations using the equity method. By the
end of 1999, all of the other owner equity contributions had been written
down to zero for financial reporting purposes. As a result, minority interest
is not reflected in the financial statements and Millennium records 100% of
Global Solar losses for accounting purposes. When Global Solar generates
net income, Millennium will recognize 100% of net income to the extent
Millennium recognized losses are greater than Millennium ownership
percentage of such losses.
- Infinite Power Solutions, Inc. is a developer of thin-film batteries
and was established in 2000. The other owner contributed certain assets and
proprietary and intellectual property relating to thin-film battery
technology.
In 2001 and 2000, Millennium provided $02 million and $15 million,
respectively, in equity funding to these entities. In 2001, 2000 and 1999,
Millennium provided net debt funding to these entities of approximately $20
million, $2 million and $4 million, respectively.
During 2001, Millennium and a privately held company formed and began to
provide funding to MicroSat Systems, Inc. and ITN Energy Systems, Inc. Even
though Millennium applies the equity method of accounting see Basis of
Presentation in Note 1 to these entities, as the sole provider of funds,
Millennium recognizes 100% of their losses.
- MicroSat Systems, Inc. MicroSat is a space systems company formed to
develop and commercialize small-scale satellites. Millennium currently owns
49% and provided $10 million in equity funding during 2001. The other owner
contributed development contracts and proprietary technologies.
- ITN Energy Systems, Inc. ITN was formed to provide research and
development and other services to affiliates, the Government and other third
parties. Millennium currently owns 49%. Millennium contributed $3 million of
equity and $16 million of debt to ITN during 2001. The other owner
contributed contracts and intellectual property.
Global Solar, MicroSat and ITN have certain government contracts that
require them to contribute to the research and development effort under cost
share arrangements. Global Solar, MicroSat and ITN share of costs are
expensed as incurred or capitalized in accordance with the terms of the
contracts. Global Solar had no remaining cost share commitment under these
contracts at December 31, 2001. MicroSat had approximately $8 million and ITN
had approximately $2 million of remaining cost share commitments under these
contracts at December 31, 2001.
We are currently evaluating and renegotiating our ownership and future
debt commitments for each of the Energy Technology Investments in order to
help ensure that these investments conform to Millennium business plans.
Millennium expects to fund the remaining balance under its current
commitments, approximately $14 million, to its various Energy Technology
Investments in 2002. We may commit to provide additional funding to these
investments. A significant portion of the funding under these agreements will
be used for research and development purposes and administrative costs. As
funds are expended for these purposes, we recognize expense.
INTERNATIONAL POWER PROJECTS - NATIONS ENERGY CORPORATION
Nations Energy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millennium. Through its
subsidiaries, Nations has a 40% equity interest in a 43 MW power plant near
Panama City, Panama. Nations Energy recorded decreases in the market value of
its Panama investment of $05 million in 2001 and $3 million per year in 2000
and 1999. In 2000, Nations Energy recognized a $3 million deferred tax
benefit related to the decreased value. Nations Energy intends to sell its
interest in this project, which has a book value of less than $1 million at
December 31, 2001.
In 2001, Nations Energy recorded an after-tax gain of $56 million from
the sale of its 26% equity interest in a power project located in Curacao,
Netherland Antilles. Nations Energy received $5 million in cash proceeds, the
return of cash construction deposits and recorded an $8 million note
receivable from the sale. The cash proceeds and the return of construction
deposits are reflected as Investing Activities in UniSource Energy 2001 cash
flow statement. The note receivable is secured by guarantees from the
purchaser parent. The note receivable was recorded at net present value,
and payments on the note receivable are expected as follows: $2 million in
July 2004, $4 million in July 2005, and $5 million in July 2006.
In 2000, Nations Energy recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $3
million from the sale of its minority interest in a power project located in
the Czech Republic. Nations received $20 million in cash proceeds from the
sale, which is reflected as an Investing Activity in UniSource Energy 2000
cash flow statement.
OTHER MILLENNIUM INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS
In July 2000, Millennium made a $15 million capital commitment to a
limited partnership which will fund energy related investments. As of
December 31, 2001, Millennium has funded approximately $6 million under this
commitment, $4 million of which was funded in 2001. The remaining $9 million
is expected to be invested within three years. The limited partnership
results of operation are recognized under the equity method based on our
ownership percentage. A member of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors has
a minor investment in the project. An affiliate of such board member serves
as the general partner.
In November 2000, Millennium made a $5 million capital commitment to a
venture capital fund that will focus on information technology, optics and
biotechnology primarily within the retail service territory of TEP. The
fund results of operation are recognized under the equity method based on
our percent ownership. A member of the UniSource Energy Board of Directors
owns the company that manages the fund. As of December 31, 2001, Millennium
had funded approximately $1 million under this commitment. Millennium expects
to fund approximately $1 million under this agreement in 2002.
In November 2001, Millennium contributed $5 million in equity and $4
million in debt financing to MEG. MEG was established to manage and trade
Emission Allowances, coal and other financial instruments. Millennium
contributions provided the working capital necessary to facilitate entry into
these markets.
In August 2001, Millennium invested $3 million for a 505% controlling
interest in Powertrusion International, Inc. Powertrusion, a manufacturer of
lightweight utility poles. Millennium consolidated Powertrusion balance
sheet and results of operations as of the investment date. Maintaining
control of Powertrusion will depend upon many factors, including providing an
additional $2 million in contingent consideration by August 2002.
Contribution of any additional investment will be solely determined by
Millennium. Minority shareholder interests in Powertrusion represent 495% of
the outstanding common shares and 100% of the outstanding cumulative preferred
shares in the company.
In July 1999, MEH Corporation sold its 50% ownership in NewEnergy, Inc.
NewEnergy to the AES Corporation for approximately $50 million in
consideration, resulting in a pre-tax gain from the sale of approximately $35
million. As part of the transaction, NewEnergy issued two promissory notes
totaling $228 million. One of the promissory notes in the principal amount
of $114 million was paid on July 24, 2000 and the remaining promissory note
for $114 million was paid on July 23, 2001. NOTE 5. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
- 
Based on the way we organize our operations and evaluate performance,
beginning in 2001, we have three reportable business segments:
1 TEP, an electric utility business, is UniSource Energy principal
business segment.
2 Millennium holds interests in unregulated energy businesses see Note
4.
3 UED, established in 2001, engages in developing generating resources
and other project development activities. UED owns a 20 MW gas turbine under
lease to TEP. It is also responsible for developing Springerville Units 3 and
4 for the expansion of the Springerville Generating Station.
As discussed in Note 1, we record our percentage share of the earnings of
affiliated companies when we hold a 20% to 50% voting interest, except for
investments where we provide all of the financing, in which case we recognize
100% of the losses. See Note 4. Our portion of the net income loss of the
entities in which TEP and Millennium own a 20-50% interest is shown below in
Net Loss from Equity Method Entities.
Significant reconciling adjustments consist of the elimination of
intercompany activity and balances, including:
- the elimination of intercompany sales between business segments;
- the elimination of the intercompany note between UniSource Energy and
TEP, as well as the related interest income and expense; and
- the elimination of UED rental income and TEP rental expense from
UED turbine lease to TEP.

- 
TEP LONG-TERM DEBT
LONG-TERM DEBT MATURES MORE THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS. WE SUMMARIZE OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE STATEMENTS OF
CAPITALIZATION.
Bond Issuance and Redemption
During 2001, TEP made the required sinking fund payments of $2 million on
its First Mortgage IDBs and redeemed $02 million of its 85% First Mortgage
Bonds. TEP did not issue any new bonds in 2001.
During 2000, TEP repaid as scheduled $47 million of its 1222% Series
First Mortgage Bonds which matured on June 1. In addition, TEP redeemed $2
million of its 75% First Collateral Trust Bonds at a discount and made
required sinking fund payments on First Mortgage Bonds of $2 million.
During 1999, TEP did not issue any new bonds or redeem existing bonds,
other than required sinking fund payments of $2 million on First Mortgage
Bonds.
TEP OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT AND AGREEMENTS
FIRST AND SECOND MORTGAGE
TEP first and second mortgage indentures are collateralized by a lien
on TEP utility plant, with the exception of Springerville Unit 2. San
Carlos, a subsidiary of TEP, holds title to Springerville Unit 2. Utility
Plant under Capital Leases is not subject to such liens or available to TEP
creditors, other than the lessors.
BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT
TEP has a $441 million Credit Agreement which provides a $100 million
Revolving Credit Facility and a $341 million Letter of Credit Facility LOC.
These credit facilities mature on December 30, 2002 and are collateralized by
$441 million of Second Mortgage Bonds. The Credit Agreement contains certain
financial covenants, including cash coverage, leverage and net worth tests.
As of December 31, 2001, TEP was in compliance with these covenants.
The Revolving Credit Facility can be used for general corporate purposes.
At December 31, 2001 and 2000, TEP had no outstanding borrowings under this
facility. When we borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, the variable
interest rate that we pay is dependent, in part, on the credit rating on TEP
senior collateralized debt. We pay an annual commitment fee on the unused
portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. This fee is also dependent on TEP
credit ratings. At December 31, 2001, the commitment fee equaled 025% per
year.
The $341 million LOC Facility secures the payment of principal and
interest on $329 million of tax-exempt variable rate bonds IDBs. The amount
of commitment fee on the LOC Facility depends on TEP credit ratings. At
December 31, 2001, the commitment fee equaled 125% per year. The LOCs expire
on December 30, 2002. If the LOCs are not extended or replaced with new LOCs
with a longer term or if the bonds are not otherwise refinanced, the bonds
would be redeemed. Accordingly, these IDBs were classified as short-term debt
at December 31, 2001, and will be classified as long-term debt once a new LOC
facility with a later expiration date is obtained.
CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
The terms of TEP capital leases are as follows   - The Irvington Lease has an initial term to January 2011 and provides
for renewal periods of two or more years through 2020.
- The Springerville Common Facilities Leases have an initial term to June
2017 for one lease and July 2020 for the other two leases, subject to optional
renewal periods of two or more years through 2025.
- The Springerville Unit 1 Leases have an initial term to January 2015
and provide for renewal periods of three or more years through 2030.
- The Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases have an initial term
to April 2015 and provide for one renewal period of six years, then additional
renewal periods of five or more years through 2035.
MATURITIES AND SINKING FUND REQUIREMENTS

Total           $ 329    $ 804     $ 873   $2,006
In addition to the capital lease obligations above, we must ensure $70
million of notes underlying the Springerville Common Facilities Leases are
refinanced by June 30, 2003 to avoid a special event of loss under the lease.
This special event of loss would require us to repurchase the Springerville
Common Facilities at the higher of the stipulated loss value of $125 million
or the fair market value of the facilities. Upon such purchase, the lease
would be terminated.
In December 2001, TEP purchased a 13% ownership interest in the
Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Leases for $13 million. In a related
transaction, in January 2002, TEP purchased all $96 million of the capital
lease debt related to these leases. In the first quarter of 2002, TEP will
cancel that portion of the leases related to its equity interest, as it holds
both the ownership interest and the debt.
In December 1999, TEP refinanced $70 million of notes underlying the
Springerville Common Facilities Leases to avoid a special event of loss under
the lease. As a result of refinancing at a higher interest rate, we recorded
an additional $26 million of capital lease obligations and capital lease
assets.

In 2000, Millennium purchased $27 million of Springerville Lease Debt
Securities. In 2001 and 2000 Millennium sold Springerville Lease Debt
Securities with a carrying value of $2 million and $25 million, respectively,
to TEP at cost.
TEP intends to hold the investment in Springerville Lease Debt Securities
to maturity $42 million matures through January 1, 2009 and $29 million
matures through January 1, 2013. These Springerville Lease Debt Securities
are stated at amortized cost, which means the purchase cost has been adjusted
for the amortization of the premium and discount to maturity. We base the
fair value of this investment on quoted market prices for the same or similar
debt. In 2001, TEP purchased, for $13 million, a 13 percent ownership
interest in the Springerville Coal Handling Facilities Lease. TEP purchases
of Springerville Lease Debt and Equity are reflected in investing activities
on TEP 2001 and 2000 cash flow statements.
TEP considers the principal amounts of variable rate debt outstanding to
be reasonable estimates of their fair value. We determined the fair value of
TEP fixed rate obligations including the Corporate First Mortgage Bonds, the
First Mortgage Bonds-IDBs, First Collateral Trust Bonds and the Unsecured IDBs
by calculating the present value of the cash flows of each fixed rate
obligation. We used a rate consistent with market yields generally available
as of December 2001 for 2001 amounts and December 2000 for 2000 amounts for
bonds with similar characteristics with respect to credit rating, time-to-
maturity, and the tax status of the bond coupon for federal income tax
purposes. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies may yield different estimated fair value amounts.
The carrying amounts of our current assets and liabilities approximate
fair value. NOTE 9. DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS
-  UNISOURCE ENERGY
In February 2002, UniSource Energy declared a quarterly dividend to the
shareholders of $0125 per share of UniSource Energy Common Stock. The
dividend, totaling approximately $40 million, will be paid on March 8, 2002
to common shareholders of record as of February 21, 2002. In 2001, UniSource
Energy paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $010 per share,
totaling approximately $13 million and $040 per share for the year. During
2000, UniSource Energy paid quarterly dividends to the shareholders of $008
per share, totaling $10 million and $032 per share for the year. UniSource
Energy did not pay dividends in 1999.
Our ability to pay cash dividends on common stock outstanding depends, in
part, upon cash flows from our subsidiaries, TEP, Millennium and UED.
TEP
TEP paid dividends of $50 million in 2001, $30 million in 2000, and $34
million in 1999. UniSource Energy is the primary holder of TEP common
stock. TEP met the following requirements before paying these dividends   - Bank Credit Agreement
TEP bank Credit Agreement allows TEP to pay dividends as long as TEP
maintains compliance with the agreement and meets financial covenants.
- ACC Holding Company Order
The ACC Holding Company Order does not allow TEP to pay dividends in
excess of 75% of its annual earnings until TEP equity ratio equals 375% of
total capitalization, excluding capital lease obligations.
- Federal Power Act
This Act states that dividends shall not be paid out of funds properly
included in capital accounts. TEP 2001, 2000 and 1999 dividends were paid
from current year earnings.
MILLENNIUM AND UED
Millennium did not pay any dividends to UniSource Energy in 2001 or 2000.
In August 1999, Millennium paid a dividend of $10 million to UniSource Energy.
UED has not paid any dividends to UniSource Energy. Millennium and UED have
no dividend restrictions. NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- 
TEP COMMITMENTS
Fuel Purchase and Transportation Commitments
TEP has several long-term contracts for the purchase and transportation
of coal with expiration dates from 2004 through 2017. The total amount paid
under these contracts depends on the number of tons of coal purchased and
transported. All of these contracts i include a price adjustment clause
that will affect the future cost of coal and ii require TEP to pay a take-or-
pay charge if certain minimum quantities of coal are not purchased. Our
present fuel requirements are in excess of the take-or-pay minimums. However,
sometimes TEP purchases coal from other suppliers, resulting in take-or-pay
minimum charges, but a lower overall cost of fuel. We made payments under
these contracts of $173 million in 2001, $157 million in 2000, and $152
million in 1999.
TEP entered into a Gas Procurement Agreement with Southwest Gas
Corporation effective June 1, 2001 with a primary term of five years. The
contract provides for a minimum volume obligation during the first two years
of 10 million MMBtus annually. We made payments under this contract of $28
million in 2001.
At December 31, 2001, we estimate our future minimum payments under these
contracts to be             Total Contractual

San Juan Coal Contract Amendment
In September 2000, to reduce fuel costs over the next 17 years, TEP
entered into an agreement to amend the San Juan Generating Station coal
supply contract, replacing two surface mining operations with one underground
operation. To amend the contract, TEP is required to make a $15 million
payment in 2003. In September 2000, as a result of this scheduled payment,
TEP recorded a pre-tax $13 million Coal Contract Amendment Fee expense and a
non-current liability which equals the present value of the $15 million
payment. TEP will recognize interest expense, included in the Interest
Imputed on Losses Recorded at Present Value line item on the income
statements, and increase its liability until the payment is made in January
2003. On a net present value basis, TEP expects the fuel savings to
significantly exceed the $15 million payment that will be made in 2003.
Operating Leases
TEP has entered into operating leases, primarily for office facilities
and computer equipment, with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates.
TEP estimated future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases
at December 31, 2001 are as follows               Operating
Leases
-Millions of Dollars-

These future payments exclude TEP lease of the 20MW gas turbine from
UED, as such rental expense is eliminated in UniSource Energy consolidation as
an inter-company transaction.
Environmental Regulation
The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments require reductions of SO2 and
nitrogen oxide NOx emissions in two phases, more complex facility permits
and other requirements. TEP is subject only to Phase II of the SO2 and NOx
emission reductions which was effective January 1, 2000. All of TEP
generating facilities except existing internal combustion turbines are
affected. TEP spent approximately $2 million in 2001 and approximately $1
million annually in 2000 and 1999 and expects to spend approximately $2
million annually in 2002 and 2003 to comply with these requirements.
In 1993, TEP generating units affected by Phase II were allocated SO2
Emission Allowances based on past operational history. Beginning in the year
2000, Phase II generating units were required to hold Emission Allowances
equal to the level of emissions in the compliance year or pay penalties and
offset excess emissions in future years. TEP had sufficient Emission
Allowances to comply with the Phase II SO2 regulations for compliance year
2001. However, due to increased energy output, TEP may have to purchase
additional Emission Allowances for future compliance years. Based on current
estimates of additional required Emission Allowances and market prices, TEP
believes that purchases of Emission Allowances will not have a material effect
on TEP.
The EPA has issued a determination that coal and oil fired electric
utility steam generating units must control their mercury emissions. Final
regulations are expected to be issued in 2004. TEP may incur additional costs
to comply with recent and future changes in federal and state environmental
laws, regulations and permit requirements at existing electric generating
facilities. Compliance with these changes may result in a reduction in
operating efficiency.
MILLENNIUM COMMITMENTS
See Note 4 for a description of Millennium commitments.
UED COMMITMENTS
UED and Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
SRP entered into a Joint Development Agreement in October 2001, to develop
two 400 MW coal-fired units at TEP existing Springerville Station. UED and
SRP each committed $125 million for a total project development funding of
$25 million for professional services and other third party costs. If the
project does not proceed, the capitalized project development costs will be
immediately expensed. At December 31, 2001, capitalized project development
costs were approximately $7 million. In addition, under certain limited
circumstances associated with withdrawal from the project, UED would be
obligated to reimburse SRP for zero, 50% or 100% of SRP previously paid
funding amounts, depending on the withdrawal circumstances.
TEP CONTINGENCIES
Springerville Generating Station Complaint
On November 13, 2001, the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental activist
group, filed a complaint in U.S. District Court against TEP for alleged
violations of the Clean Air Act at the Springerville Generating Station. The
complaint alleges that more stringent emission standards should apply to Units
1 and 2 and that new permits and the installation of additional facilities
meeting Best Available Control Technology standards are required for the
continued operation of Units 1 and 2 in accordance with applicable law. TEP
believes the claims are without merit and will vigorously contest these
claims.
RESOLUTION OF TEP CONTINGENCIES
Income Tax Assessments
In 2000 the IRS issued an income tax assessment for the 1994, 1995 and
1996 tax years. After reviewing the impact of these items on our accrued tax
liabilities, we reversed $1 million of the deferred tax valuation allowance in
2000. See Note 12. The audit for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 period was settled
in 2001 resulting in no other adjustments to our financial statements.
In February 1998, the IRS issued an income tax assessment for the 1992
and 1993 tax years. The IRS challenged our treatment of various items
relating to a 1992 financial restructuring, including the amount of net
operating loss NOL and ITC generated before December 1991 that may be used
to reduce taxes in future periods. In 2000, we settled the 1992 and 1993
audits. After reviewing the impact of these items on our accrued tax
liabilities, we reversed $7 million of the deferred tax valuation allowance in
2000. See Note 12.
ACC Order on the Sierrita Contract
In September 2000, TEP reversed a $3 million reserve, resulting in $3
million of revenue, related to a dispute between TEP and Cyprus Sierrita
Corporation now known as Phelps Dodge Sierrita, Inc. Sierrita over the
proper method of calculating energy costs that TEP charged to Sierrita under
an ACC-approved contract. Sierrita dismissed its appeals to the Court of
Appeals after TEP and Sierrita entered into an amendment to their contract,
which was subsequently approved by the ACC.
Arizona Sales Tax Assessments
From 1990 to 1999 TEP contested certain sales tax assessments received
from the Arizona Department of Revenue ADOR. The sales tax assessments
related to gross income recognized by a former TEP subsidiary from November
1985 through May 1999, as well as a component of rents that we paid on our
capital leases from August 1988 to June 1997.
In August 1999, a settlement was reached with the ADOR to settle these
issues for $48 million. The settlement agreement became effective in November
1999 when the lessors and their trustees agreed to the settlement. TEP
previously paid $25 million of the settlement amount in order to file an
appeal in the Arizona courts. Under the terms of the agreement, the remaining
$22 million was deposited into an escrow account and the funds were released
to the ADOR in five equal installments during 1999 and 2000. The settlement
did not result in additional sales tax expense because we had previously
recorded an expense for the settlement amount. NOTE 11. WHOLESALE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES
- 
As a participant in the western U.S. wholesale power markets, TEP is
directly and indirectly impacted by issues surrounding these markets and
market participants. During 2000 and 2001, these markets experienced
unprecedented price volatility, bankruptcies and payment defaults by several
of their largest participants, and increased attention and intervention by
regulatory agencies concerned with the outcomes of deregulation of the
electric power industry.
In early 2001, California two largest utilities, Southern California
Edison Company SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company PG, defaulted on
payment obligations owed to various energy sellers, including the California
Power Exchange CPX and the California Independent System Operator CISO.
The CPX and the CISO defaulted on their payment obligations to market
participants including TEP. PG and the CPX filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. SCE has remained out of bankruptcy
but in a weakened financial condition. SCE has publicly disclosed that on
March 1, 2002, SCE obtained financing and made payments so that they have no
material undisputed obligations that are past due or in default. These
payments included a payment to the CPX. However, TEP did not correspondingly
receive a payment from the CPX.
In October 2001, the CPX participant creditors' committee in the CPX
bankruptcy filed a proposed settlement with the FERC that would i return the
collateral of each CPX participant, ii establish a reserve for CPX costs and
expenses that would be paid for by PG and SCE according to a 675% and 325%
split, respectively, iii return CPX chargeback payments to participants, and
iv divide the remaining cash and future assets among the participants based
on the net amounts owed to the CPX by both parties. PG and SCE filed with
the FERC their objections to such settlement on the basis that the proposed
settlement was biased and could subject the two companies to duplicate claims.
During the third quarter of 2001, PG filed a plan of reorganization
which provides for payment of all creditors on or around January 1, 2003. The
plan requires various approvals and numerous parties have expressed opposition
to the plan. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the California Public Utilities
Commission CPUC approved a plan to allow SCE to obtain financing to pay all
of its creditors by the end of the first quarter of 2002.
Although TEP did not make sales directly to either SCE or PG in 2001 or
2000, it did sell approximately $7 million of power to the CPX and the CISO in
the first quarter of 2001 and $58 million in 2000. TEP recorded $7 million of
expense in the first quarter of 2001 and $9 million in the fourth quarter of
2000 to reserve for uncollectible amounts related to these sales. The $16
million aggregate allowance reflected a 100% reserve on all amounts unpaid at
March 31, 2001. Due to the recent a stabilization of the power markets, b
rate increases achieved by PG and SCE, c settlements made by California
utilities with various power providers, d the CPUC approval of SCE
financing to pay its creditors, and e data in filings of FERC refund
hearings, TEP believes that it is probable that it will collect at least 50%
of the outstanding receivables from the CPX and the CISO. As a result, in the
fourth quarter of 2001 we reversed $8 million of the $16 million reserve.
Beginning in January 2001, the California Department of Water Resources
CDWR was authorized to make energy purchases on behalf of California
customers. TEP sold $16 million of power to the CDWR in 2001, all of which
has been paid according to terms.
Also during 2000, the FERC established certain soft caps on prices for
power sold at the CPX. The caps did not have a significant impact on sales to
the CPX during the first three quarters of 2000. However, during the fourth
quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001, prices for power in the day-
ahead and real-time markets frequently exceeded the caps established by FERC.
During March 2001, the FERC issued two orders requiring certain generators
that sold power to California in January and February 2001 to either refund
amounts over specified market prices or provide further data to defend their
transactions. TEP was not named in either of these orders.
In June 2001, a FERC administrative law judge ALJ facilitated a
voluntary settlement between the state of California and numerous power
generators. California claims it was overcharged up to $9 billion for
wholesale power purchases since May 2000 and is seeking a refund for unlawful
profits. Unlawful profits has not been defined. Representatives from over
100 parties and participants in the western power market, including the state
of California and power generators, negotiated for two weeks but failed to
reach an agreement. In July 2001, based on the ALJ recommendations, the
FERC ordered hearings to determine refunds/offsets applicable to wholesale
sales into the CISO spot markets for the period from October 2, 2000 to June
20, 2001. The order established the methodology that will be used to
calculate the amount of refunds. This methodology will likely result in
refunds substantially lower than the $9 billion claimed by California.
We are not able to predict the length and outcome of the FERC hearings
and the outcome of any subsequent lawsuits and appeals that might be filed.
As a participant in the June 2001 refund proceedings, TEP will be subject to
any final refund orders. TEP does not expect its refund liability, if any, to
have a significant impact on the financial statements.
On December 2, 2001, Enron Corporation and certain of its affiliates
Enron filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At
December 31, 2001, TEP net receivable from Enron was $08 million for sales
made to Enron in November and December 2001. We reserved $04 million in
December 2001, as we believe it is probable that we will collect 50% of this
net receivable.
There are several other outstanding legal issues, complaints, and
lawsuits concerning the California energy crisis related to the FERC,
wholesale power suppliers, SCE, PG, the CPX and the CISO, and concerning
Enron. We cannot predict the outcome of these issues or lawsuits. We
believe, however, that we are adequately reserved for our transactions with
the CPX, the CISO and Enron. Accounts receivable from Electric Wholesale
Sales, net of allowances, totaled $70 million at December 31, 2001 and $64
million at December 31, 2000. These amounts are included in Accounts
Receivable on the balance sheet. All balances, except as described above for
the CPX, the CISO and Enron, have been collected in full as of the date of
this filing. NOTE 12. INCOME TAXES

We record a Deferred Tax Assets Valuation Allowance for the amount of
Deferred Tax Assets that we do not believe we can use to reduce income taxes
on a future tax return. In 2001, there was no change in the Deferred Tax
Assets Valuation Allowance. In 2000, the Deferred Tax Assets Valuation
Allowance decreased $8 million due primarily to the improved likelihood of
favorable resolution of tax items. In 1999, the Deferred Tax Assets Valuation
Allowance decreased $32 million due primarily to recognized ITC Carryforward
included in Extraordinary Income and a reversal of a tax reserve.

At December 31, 2001, UniSource Energy and TEP had, for federal income
tax purposes   - $142 million of NOL carryforwards expiring in 2006 through 2009;
- $11 million of unused ITC expiring in 2003 through 2005; and
- $83 million of Alternative Minimum Tax credit which will carry forward
to future years.
Due to the financial restructuring, a change in TEP ownership occurred
for tax purposes in December 1991. This change limits our use of the NOL and
ITC generated before 1992 under the tax code. At December 31, 2001, we had
approximately $136 million of NOL and $11 million of ITC subject to the pre-
1992 limitation and $6 million of NOL not subject to the limitation. Because
of the valuation allowance amounts recorded, we do not expect these annual
limitations to have a material adverse impact on the financial statements. NOTE 13. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PLANS
- 
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
TEP maintains noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans for all
regular employees. Benefits are based on years of service and the employee
average compensation. TEP makes annual contributions to the plans sufficient
to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional tax deductible amounts as
may be advisable. TEP provides supplemental retirement benefits to employees
whose benefits are limited by IRS benefit or compensation limitations.
TEP also provides health care and life insurance benefits for retirees.
All regular employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach
retirement age while working for TEP. The ACC allows TEP to recover through
rates postretirement costs only as benefit payments are made to or on behalf
of retirees. The postretirement benefits are currently funded entirely on a
pay-as-you-go basis. Under current accounting guidance, TEP cannot record a
regulatory asset for the excess of expense calculated per Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, over actual benefit payments.
We amended our other postretirement benefit plan as of June 1, 2001,
eliminating post-65 medical benefits for salaried employees retiring after
January 1, 2002 and capping Medicare supplement payments for salaried retirees
under age 65. This amendment required us to recalculate benefits related to
participants' past service. We are amortizing the change in the benefit cost
from this plan amendment on a straight-line basis over 10 years.
The actuarial present values of the pension benefit obligations were
measured at December 1 in 2001 and October 1 in 2000. The measurement date
for our other postretirement benefit plan was December 1 in 2001 and December
31 in 2000. We changed the measurement dates to be the same and this change
had no effect on 2001 expense. The change in benefit obligation and plan
assets and reconciliation of the funded status are as follows                              Other Postretirement

We recorded a transition asset or obligation when we adopted accounting
standards requiring recognition of pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations and costs in the financial statements. The transition asset or
obligation equaled the difference between the fair value of plan assets and
the accumulated benefit obligation. We amortized the transition asset on the
pension plans over a 15-year period ending December 31, 2001. The transition
obligation on the postretirement benefit plan was being amortized over 20
years. The change in the benefit cost from the 2001 plan amendment eliminated
the remaining transition obligation.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was determined using a
discount rate of 725% for 2001 and 75% for 2000. Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care
plans. The health care cost trend rates were assumed to be 85% for 2002,
80% in 2003, 75% in 2004, then gradually declining to 50% in 2009 and
thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
All regular employees may contribute a percentage of their pre-tax
compensation, subject to certain limitations, in TEP voluntary, defined
contribution 401k plans. TEP contributes cash to the account of each
participant based on each participant contributions not exceeding 45% of
the participant compensation. Participants direct the investment of
contributions to certain funds in their account. TEP incurred approximately
$3 million in expense related to these plans in each of 2001 and 2000, and $2
million in 1999.
STOCK OPTION PLANS
On May 20, 1994, the Shareholders approved two stock option plans, the
1994 Outside Director Stock Option Plan 1994 Directors' Plan and the 1994
Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan 1994 Omnibus Plan.
The 1994 Directors' Plan provided for the annual grant of 1,200 non-
qualified stock options to each eligible director at an exercise price equal
to the market price of the common stock at the grant date, beginning January
3, 1995. These options vest over three years, become exercisable in one-third
increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the tenth
anniversary. In December 1998, the Board of Directors approved an increase in
the annual grant of non-qualified stock options to 2,000 beginning January
1999.
The 1994 Omnibus Plan allows the Compensation Committee, a committee of
non-employee directors, to grant the following types of awards to each
eligible employee: stock options; stock appreciation rights; restricted stock;
stock units; performance units; performance shares; and dividend equivalents.
The total number of shares of UniSource Energy Common Stock that may be
awarded under the Omnibus Plan cannot exceed 41 million.
The Compensation Committee granted stock options to key employees during
2001, 2000, and 1999 and to most employees in 1999. These stock options were
granted at exercise prices equal to the market price of the common stock at
the grant date. These options vest over three years, become exercisable in
one-third increments on each anniversary date of the grant and expire on the
tenth anniversary.
A summary of the activity of the 1994 Directors' Plan and 1994 Omnibus
Plan is as follows              2001         2000        1999

We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, in accounting for our stock option plans. Accordingly,
we have not recognized any compensation cost for the plans. We have also
adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123. Had our
compensation costs for the stock option plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant date for awards in 2001, 2000 and 1999 consistent with
the provisions of FAS 123, net income and net income per average share would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                        Years Ended December 31,

- 
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS assumes
that proceeds from the hypothetical exercise of stock options and other stock-
based awards are used to repurchase outstanding shares of stock at the average
fair market price during the reporting period. The following table shows the
amounts used in computing earnings per share and the effects of potential
dilutive common stock on the weighted average number of shares.

Options to purchase an average of 120,000 shares of common stock at
$1669 to $1884 per share were outstanding during the year 2001 but were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because the options' exercise price
was greater than the average market price of the common stock.
At December 31, 2001, UniSource Energy had no outstanding warrants. There
were 46 million warrants outstanding that were exercisable into TEP common
stock. See Note 15. However, the dilutive effect is the same as it would be
if the warrants were exercisable into UniSource Energy Common Stock. NOTE 15. WARRANTS
-  UNISOURCE ENERGY
At December 31, 2001, UniSource Energy had no outstanding warrants. In
December 2000, 791,966 UniSource Energy Warrants, that were scheduled to
expire on December 15, 2000, were exercised resulting in a $13 million
increase in common stock equity. The remaining 700,445 warrants expired. The
exercised warrants allowed the holder to purchase one share of UniSource
Energy Common Stock for $1600. As a result, 791,966 shares of stock were
issued.
TEP
At December 31, 2001, 46 million of TEP Warrants, which expire on
December 15, 2002, were outstanding. The TEP Warrants entitle the holder of
five warrants to purchase one share of TEP common stock for $1600. If all
TEP Warrants were exercised, approximately 900,000 additional shares of TEP
common stock would be issued. The TEP common stock that would be issued upon
the exercise of TEP Warrants cannot be converted into UniSource Energy Common
Stock. UniSource Energy is the primary holder of the common stock of TEP and
TEP common stock is not publicly traded. NOTE 16. UNISOURCE ENERGY SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
- 
In March 1999, UniSource Energy adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. As of
April 1, 1999, each Common Stock shareholder receives one Right for each share
held. Each Right initially allows shareholders to purchase UniSource Energy
Series X Preferred Stock at a specified purchase price. However, the Rights
are exercisable only if a person or group the acquirer acquires or
commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of UniSource Energy Common
Stock. Each Right would entitle the holder except the acquirer to purchase
a number of shares of UniSource Energy Common or Preferred Stock or, in the
case of a merger of UniSource Energy into another person or group, common
stock of the acquiring person having a fair market value equal to twice the
specified purchase price. At any time until any person or group has acquired
15% or more of the Common Stock, UniSource Energy may redeem the Rights at a
redemption price of $0001 per Right. The Rights trade automatically with the
Common Stock when it is bought and sold. The Rights expire on March 31, 2009. NOTE 17. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
