ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Aware, Inc. We have completed integrated audits of Aware, Inc. consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary at December 31, 2006 and
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under a2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company changed its
method of accounting for share-based payments on January 1, 2006.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Also, in our opinion, management assessment, included in Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED
FRAMEWORK issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, based on criteria established in INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK
issued by the COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
31 generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   NATURE OF BUSINESS
We are a worldwide leader in the development and marketing of
intellectual property for broadband communications. Our principal
offering to date has been Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ADSL
technology for the telecommunications industry. ADSL enables telephone
companies to use their existing copper telephone lines to offer
broadband services. We license our broadband technology on a
nonexclusive and worldwide basis to semiconductor companies that
manufacture and sell integrated circuits that incorporate our technology
to equipment companies who incorporate those integrated circuits into
their products. We also offer ADSL hardware and software products and
biometrics, medical and digital imaging software products. 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Aware, Inc. and its subsidiary. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily
of demand deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, and discount
notes in highly liquid short-term instruments with original maturities
of three months or less from the date of purchase and are stated at
cost, which approximates market.
INVESTMENTS - At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we categorized all
securities as available-for-sale, since we may liquidate these
investments currently. In calculating realized gains and losses, cost is
determined using specific identification. Unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in
a separate component of stockholders' equity if material. At December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, unrealized gains and losses were not material.
Gross realized gains on available for sale securities was $10 in 2006,
$0 in 2005 and $665 in 2004. Gross realized losses on available for sale
securities was $3,387 in 2006, $0 in 2005 and 2004.
At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we held $191 million and
$171 million, respectively, of auction variable rate notes classified
as available-for-sale securities. Our investments in these securities
are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to their
variable interest rates, which typically reset every 28 days, and,
despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we
have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities. As a result, we
had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross
realized gains losses from these investments. All income generated
from these investments was recorded as interest income.
The amortized cost of securities, which approximates fair value,
consists of the following at December 31, 2006 and 2005 in thousands     SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS            2006       2005

Short-term investments mature within three to twelve months, and
investments mature within one to two years.
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Accounts are charged to the allowance
for doubtful accounts as they are deemed uncollectible based on a
periodic review of the accounts.
37                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
cost being determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Upon retirement or sale, the costs of the assets disposed of and
the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of income or
loss. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as
incurred.
The estimated useful lives of assets used by us are      Building and  30 years
Building  5 to 20 years
Furniture and  5 years
Computer, office & manufacturing equipment. 3 years
Purchased  3 years     IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS - We review long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or
that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each
impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows
to the recorded value of the asset. If an impairment is indicated, the
asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash
flow basis. The cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment, if
any, reflect our best estimates using appropriate assumptions and
projections at that time. We believe that no significant impairment of
our long-lived assets has occurred as of December 31, 2006 and 2005.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff
Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, SAB 104 and related
interpretations. Accordingly, our general revenue recognition policy is
to recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an
arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the
related receivable is reasonably assured, and delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered.
We derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue, which
includes revenue from the sale of ADSL hardware and software products
and biometrics medical and digital imaging software products, ii
contract revenue, which includes patent, license and engineering service
fees that we receive under customer agreements, and iii royalties that
we receive under customer agreements. In addition to the above general
revenue recognition principles prescribed by SAB 104, our specific
revenue recognition policies for each revenue source are more fully
described below.
PRODUCT SALES. Product sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale
of: i hardware products, and ii software products.
o    Hardware products, including ADSL modules and ADSL test
and development systems are standalone products that are
sold independently of our technology licensing products.
The terms of sales generally do not contain provisions
that obligate us to provide additional products or
services after shipment. Additionally, we do not grant
return rights other than normal warranty rights of
return. We recognize revenue: i upon shipment when
products are shipped FOB shipping point, and ii upon
delivery at the customer location when products are
shipped FOB destination.
o    Software products consists of standard off-the-shelf
software that are generally sold to OEM customers for
integration into their products. The terms of sale
generally do not contain provisions that obligate us to
provide additional products or services after shipment,
other than technical telephone support for a brief
period of time post sale. The cost of providing
technical support is inconsequential because of the
limited scope of the support. Additionally, we do not
grant return rights other than normal warranty
38                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS             rights of return, and we generally do not customize
software for customers. We also sell maintenance
contracts that entitle customers to product updates.
We recognize software revenue by applying the principles
set forth in SAB 104 and American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position No.
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we
recognize revenue for software licenses: i upon
shipment when products are shipped FOB shipping point,
and ii upon delivery at the customer location when
products are shipped FOB destination. We recognize
revenue for maintenance contracts ratably over the
related contract period.
CONTRACT REVENUE. We enter into nonexclusive development and license
agreements with semiconductor licensees that generally require us to
deliver technology and/or provide engineering services. In return, we
receive one or more of the following forms of consideration: i patent
and license fees; ii engineering service fees; and iii royalty
payments.
License fees, patent fees or engineering services fees are typically
paid and the revenue is recognized during the product development period
as technology is delivered or as engineering services milestones are
achieved. Engineering milestones have historically been formulated to
correlate with the estimated level of effort and related costs. We
classify license, patent and engineering service fees as contract
revenue.
When our agreements include both the delivery of licensing rights and
technology and the provision of engineering services, we combine the
total patent, license and engineering service fees to be paid under the
agreement. These total fees are recognized ratably over the expected
product development period, subject to the limitation that the
cumulative revenue recognized through the end of any period may not
exceed cumulative contract payments to date. We review assumptions
regarding the product development period on a regular basis and make
adjustments as required. We believe that this method represents the
appropriate systematic method for revenue recognition for this type of
contract.
After customers enter into development and license agreements, they
often engage us to provide additional engineering work that is beyond
the scope of their original agreement. When customers request additional
services, both parties agree to engineering fees that are based on the
level of effort required. We recognize revenue from these agreements
either as engineering services are performed or as milestones are
achieved.
ROYALTY REVENUE. Royalty revenue is generally recognized in the quarter
in which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of
products incorporating our intellectual property. This report is
typically received in the quarter following sales of the licensed
product by the licensee. The terms of our licensing agreements generally
require licensees to give notification to us and to pay royalties within
45 to 60 days of the end of the quarter during which sales of licensed
products take place.
INCOME TAXES - We compute deferred income taxes based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities
using enacted rates in effect in the years in which the differences are
expected to reverse. We establish a valuation allowance to offset
temporary deductible differences, net operating loss carryforwards and
tax credits when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.
CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE COSTS - We capitalize certain internally
generated software development costs after technological feasibility of
the product has been established. No software costs were capitalized for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, because such costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility,
but prior to commercial availability, were immaterial.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS - Costs incurred in the research and
development of the Company products are expensed as incurred.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had
cash and investments, in excess of federally insured deposit limits of
approximately $397 million and $367 million, respectively.
39                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     Concentration of credit risk with respect to net accounts receivable
consists of $11 million, $09 million, and $06 million with three
customers at December 31, 2006 and $14 million, $06 million, and $03
million with three customers at December 31, 2005.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - We grant stock options to our employees and
directors. Such grants are for a fixed number of shares with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R,
which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for
employee services. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, stock-based
compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value
of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee
requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity
award. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair
value of service condition awards. This valuation model takes into
account the exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of
significant assumptions. These assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of stock options include the expected term, the expected
volatility of our stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest
rate over the expected term, and our expected annual dividend yield. We
recognize compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based
compensation to employees in accordance with APB 25 and related
interpretations. We also followed the disclosure requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. We elected to adopt the modified
prospective transition method as provided by SFAS 123R and,
accordingly, financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented
in this Form 10-K have not been restated to reflect the fair value
method of expensing stock-based compensation.
COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE - Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share
is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential
common shares had been issued. For the purposes of this calculation,
stock options are considered common stock equivalents in periods in
which they have a dilutive effect. Stock options that are antidilutive
are excluded from the calculation.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates include revenue recognition, reserves for doubtful accounts,
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, useful lives of fixed
assets, valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets, and accrued
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying amounts of cash and
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their
short-term nature.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS - Comprehensive income loss is defined as
the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources,
including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains
and losses on marketable securities. For the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, comprehensive income loss was not materially
different from net income loss.
ADVERTISING COSTS - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were
not material for 2006, 2005 and 2004.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - In July 2006, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in tax returns that effect amounts reported in a company
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. FIN 48 establishes a threshold condition that a tax
position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to
40                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     be recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance
concerning derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and
penalties and disclosure of tax positions. FIN 48 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are currently
evaluating the effects of FIN 48 on our financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements SFAS 157. The Statement provides guidance for using
fair value to measure assets and liabilities. This Statement references
fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts. The
Statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or
liabilities to be measured at fair value. The Statement does not expand
the use of fair value in any new circumstances. It is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November
15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of
SFAS 157 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC,
Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 SAB 108 addressing
how the effects of prior-year uncorrected financial statement
misstatements should be considered in current-year financial statements.
SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both
balance-sheet and income-statement approaches and to evaluate whether
either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in
light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 does not
change the SEC staff previous guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 99, Materialty on evaluating the materiality of misstatements.
SAB 108 addresses the mechanics of correcting misstatements that include
the effects from prior years. Additionally, SAB 108 requires registrants
to apply the new guidance for the first time that it identifies material
errors in existence at the beginning of the first fiscal year ending
after November 15, 2006 by correcting those errors through a one-time
cumulative effect adjustment to beginning-of-year retained earnings. The
adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statements No.
115 SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose, at specified
election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value the fair value
option. A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at
each subsequent reporting period. This accounting standard is effective
as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year that begins after
November 15, 2007. The effect, if any, of adopting SFAS 159 on our
financial position and results of operations has not been finalized.
SEGMENTS - We organize ourselves as one segment reporting to the chief
operating decision-maker. We have sales outside of the United States,
which are described in Note 8. All long-lived assets are maintained in
the United States.

In 2006, we increased the valuation allowance by $08 million to $438
million primarily as a result of additional net operating losses and tax
credits. The valuation allowance was recorded against deferred tax
assets because we determined that it was more likely than not that all
of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.
42                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     We have incurred net operating losses in 2006, 2005, and 2004. At
December 31, 2006 and 2005, these cumulative factors resulted in our
continued decision that it is more likely than not that all of our
deferred tax assets may not be realized. If we generate sustained future
taxable income against which these tax attributes may be applied, some
portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed. If the
valuation allowance is reversed approximately $225 million would be
recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital reflecting the
benefit of deductions from the exercise of stock options.
We did not record a provision for income taxes in 2006 due to a net
operating loss and the uncertainty of the timing of profitability in
future periods, except for $04 million of taxes paid in non-U.S.
jurisdictions that assess a source withholding tax.
As of December 31, 2006, we had federal net operating loss and research
and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $499 million
and $114 million respectively, which may be available to offset future
federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates from 2007
through 2026. In addition, at December 31, 2006, we had approximately
$83 million and $58 million of state net operating losses and state
research and development and investment tax carryforwards, respectively,
which expire at various dates from 2007 through 2021. Ownership changes,
if any, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, may limit the amount of
net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset
future taxable income.
6.   EQUITY AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
As discussed in Note 2, we adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006. Prior
to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for share-based compensation
to employees in accordance with APB 25 and related interpretations. The
adoption of SFAS 123R had a significant impact on our results of
operations.
At December 31, 2006, we have four stock-based compensation plans, which
are described below     FIXED STOCK OPTION PLANS - We have three fixed option plans. Under the
1990 Incentive and Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan 1990 Plan, we may
grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to our
employees and directors for up to 2,873,002 shares of common stock.
Under the 1996 Stock Option Plan 1996 Plan, we may grant incentive
stock options or nonqualified stock options to our employees and
directors for up to 6,100,000 shares of common stock. Under the 2001
Nonqualified Stock Plan 2001 Plan, we may grant nonqualified stock
options or stock awards to our employees and directors for up to
8,000,000 shares of common stock. Under all three plans, options are
granted at an exercise price as determined by the Board of Directors and
have terms ranging from four to a maximum of ten years. Our options
generally vest over three to five years, although we have granted
options that are 50% or fully vested on the date of grant. As of
December 31, 2006, there were 4,616,107 shares available for grant under
the 2001 Plan, and no shares available under the 1996 and 1990 Plans. In
February 2005, we granted fully vested stock options to our directors
and certain of our officers to purchase an aggregate of 1,658,500 shares
of our common stock. The options were granted with exercise prices equal
to the fair market value of our common stock on the dates of grant.
During 2006, the Company awarded unrestricted stock to its employees
under the 2001 Plan. A total of 65,464 shares were distributed
representing $367,000 of stock-based compensation expense.
The following table presents stock-based employee compensation expenses
included in the Company consolidated statements of operations in
thousands:
2006
Cost of product sales            $  15
Cost of contract revenue            149
Research and development            904
Selling and marketing              289
General and administrative           580
Stock-based compensation expense       $1,937
43                  AWARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the Company net income for the
year ended December 31, 2006 was lower by $1,570,000 than if it had
continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. Basic
and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
also lower by $007 and $006, respectively, due to the adoption of SFAS
123R.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. This valuation model takes into account
the exercise price of the award, as well as a variety of significant
assumptions. These assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock
options include the expected term, the expected volatility of the
Company stock over the expected term, the risk-free interest rate over
the expected term, and the Company expected annual dividend yield. The
Company believes that the valuation technique and the approach utilized
to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the
fair values of the Company stock options granted in the year ended
December 31, 2006. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict
actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who
receive equity awards.
Assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted during
the year ended December 31, 2006, using the Black-Scholes valuation
model were                       YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 2006
Expected term1              325-625 years
Expected volatility factor2            60-67%
Risk-free interest rate3            455-499%
Expected annual dividend yield               
1   The expected term for each grant was determined as the midpoint between
the vesting date and the end of the contractual term, also known as the
simplified method for estimating the expected term described by Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 SAB 107.
2   The expected volatility for each grant is estimated based on an average
of historical volatility for a period equal to the expected term of the
stock option.
3   The risk-free interest rate for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equal to the
expected term of the stock option.
We do not estimate our forfeiture rates as the actual forfeiture rate is known
at the end of each reporting period due to the timing of our stock option
vesting.
A summary of the transactions of our three fixed stock option plans for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are presented below                         2006             2005            2004

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     All options granted during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004 had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company
common stock on the date of grant, and the weighted average grant date
fair values of options granted were $285, $425 and $216,
respectively.
At December 31, 2006, the weighted average remaining contractual term
for both options outstanding and options exercisable was 7 years.
At December 31, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of options
outstanding and options exercisable was $31,179,000 and $26,859,000,
respectively. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by
which the market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise
price of the option. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised
during the year ended December 31, 2006 was $800,000.

At December 31, 2006, unrecognized compensation expense related to
non-vested stock options was $2,029,000, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years.
Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based
compensation to employees in accordance with APB 25. The Company also
had previously adopted the provisions of SFAS 123, which required
disclosure only of stock-based compensation and its impact on net income
loss and net income loss per share. The following table illustrates
the effects on net loss and net loss per share for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 as if the Company had applied

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     In determining the stock-based compensation expense to be disclosed
under SFAS 123, the Company was required to estimate the fair value of
stock awards granted to employees using the Black-Scholes valuation
model. However, differences between the requirements of SFAS 123R and
SFAS 123 resulted in a different set of assumptions determined by the
Company to be used in its valuation model. Assumptions used to determine
the fair value of options granted under SFAS 123 during the years ended

shares to satisfy option exercises and purchases under the Company
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN - In June 1996, we adopted an Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP Plan under which eligible employees
could purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the
fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of each
six-month offering period. On November 29, 2005 we amended the ESPP Plan
to provide that eligible employees may purchase common stock at a price
equal to 95% of the fair market value of the common stock as of the end
of each six-month offering period. There is no stock-based compensation
expense related to the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan because it
is not considered a compensatory plan. The plan does not have a
look-back feature, and has a minimal discount of 5% of the fair market
value of the common stock as of the end of each six-month offering
period. Participation in the ESPP Plan is limited to 6% of an employee
compensation, may be terminated at any time by the employee and
automatically ends on termination of employment. A total of 350,000
shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. As of December
31, 2006 there were 137,487 shares available for future issuance under
the ESPP Plan. We issued 2,320, 32,873 and 48,437 common shares under
the ESPP Plan in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN - In October 2001, our board of directors
adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution
of one share purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of
our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on
October 15, 2001. Each share of common stock issued after that date also
will carry with it one Right, subject to certain exceptions. Each Right,
when it becomes exercisable, will entitle the record holder to purchase
from us one ten-thousandth of a share of series A preferred stock at an
exercise price of $4000 subject to adjustment.
The Rights become exercisable upon the earliest of the following dates:
i the date on which we first publicly announce that a person or group
has become an acquiring person, or ii the date, if any, that our board
of directors may designate following the commencement of, or first
public disclosure of an intent to commence, a tender or exchange offer
which could result in the potential buyer becoming a beneficial owner of
15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Under these circumstances,
holders of Rights will be entitled to purchase, for the exercise price,
the preferred stock equivalent of common stock having a market value of
two times the exercise price. The Rights expire on October 2, 2011, and
may be redeemed by us for $001 per Right. 7.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS - We own our principal office and research facility in
Bedford, Massachusetts, which we have occupied since November 1997. We
conduct a portion of our activities in leased facilities in Lafayette
and San Jose, California under non-cancelable operating leases that
expires in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The following is a schedule of
future minimum rental payments in thousands                    46                  AWARE, INC.

Rental expense was approximately $26,000, $26,000 and $35,000 in 2006,

LITIGATION - There are no material pending legal proceedings to which we
are a party or to which any of our properties are subject which, either
individually or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of
operations.
GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS - We enter into licensing
agreements in the ordinary course of business that require us: i to
perform under the terms of the contracts, ii to protect the
confidentiality of our customers' intellectual property, and iii to
indemnify customers, including indemnification against third party
claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights. We also
have agreements with each of our directors and executive officers to
indemnify such directors or executive officers, to the extent legally
permissible, against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection
with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of
such individual being or having been a director or officer of the
Company.
Given the nature of the above obligations and agreements, we are unable
to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount that we
could be required to pay. Historically, we have not made any significant
payments on the above guarantees and indemnifications and no amount has
been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with
respect to these guarantees and indemnifications. 8.   BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS

equivalents of 1,824,826, and 356,411, respectively, were not included
in the per share calculation for diluted EPS, because we had a net loss
and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. For the years
ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, options to purchase 2,423,242,
2,340,167 and 280,605 shares of common stock at average weighted prices
of $718, $736 and $1606 per share, respectively, were outstanding,
but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of
the common shares and thus would be anti-dilutive. 11.   QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - UNAUDITED
