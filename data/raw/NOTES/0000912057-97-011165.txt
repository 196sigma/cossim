ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The Report of Independent Accountants, and the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and the notes thereto appear on the following pages.                    24            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
DNAP Holding Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of DNAP Holding Corporation at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of DNAP Holding Corporation management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION
DNAP Holding Corporation together with its subsidiaries, the Company, a
subsidiary of Bionova, S.A. de C.V. Bionova, a Mexican corporation, was formed
on January 12, 1996 and originally named Bionova U.S. Inc., to be the holding
company of a consolidated group, which includes certain former subsidiaries of
Bionova the Bionova Subsidiaries and, after consummation of the merger
discussed below effective September 26, 1996, DNA Plant Technology Corporation
and its subsidiaries DNAP. The Bionova subsidiaries consist of majority
interests in Agricola Batiz, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican company, and subsidiaries
ABSA and International Produce Holding Company, a Delaware corporation, and
subsidiaries IPHC. THE COMPANY AND THE BIONOVA SUBSIDIARIES
On January 26, 1996, the Company issued 25,000 shares to Bionova in exchange for
a capital contribution of $25,000 and borrowed $5 million from Bionova under a
demand note agreement, at a fixed interest rate of 1025%.
On July 1, 1996 Bionova transferred its interest in the Bionova Subsidiaries to
the Company and $5 million in cash in exchange for 270,922 common shares and
acquired an additional 2,800 common shares of the Company for $280,000 on 
August 1, 1996. Additionally, Bionova contributed the $5 million demand note in
exchange for 50,000 common shares on August 2, 1996. On August 5, 1996 Bionova
contributed its shares of the Company common stock to its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Bionova International, Inc.
The consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared giving
retroactive effect to the contribution of the Bionova Subsidiaries in a manner
similar to a pooling of interest. DNAP MERGER
On September 26, 1996, the merger of Bionova Acquisition, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, with and into DNAP the Merger was approved by
DNAP stockholders and was consummated. Upon consummation of the Merger, Bionova
International, Inc. contributed an additional $8 million to the Company for
12,510,726 common shares, and the former DNAP stockholders received 5,511,192
common shares. The name of the Company was changed to DNAP Holding Corporation
immediately prior to the Merger.
The value of the shares of the Company common stock issued in connection with
the Merger was determined based on the number of shares of DNAP common stock
and DNAP $225 Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock outstanding, at the
fair value of the securities based on their respective closing prices as quoted
on the Nasdaq National Market at July 30, 1996, the date of the second amendment
to the merger agreement.                    30                        Shares     Fair market  Fair market

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a. Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of i the Company,
ii the Bionova Subsidiaries, iii effective September 26, 1996, DNAP, and
iv effective November 30, 1996, Royal Van Namen. All intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. b. Management estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
amounts could differ from reported amounts. c. Revenue recognition
PRODUCE SALES
The Company sells produce on its own account and on behalf of growers and other
parties on a commissioned basis. Revenue from such sales is recognized when the
produce is shipped, net of an allowance for estimated returns. Since the
Company bears the risk of loss for collection of sales proceeds for sales on
behalf of growers and other parties on which commissions are earned, the
associated sales are recognized at the gross sales amounts, net of an allowance
for estimated returns or other credits. In the consolidated results of
operations, 1996 and 1995 sales recognized on a commissioned basis and the
related commissions earned were as follows                    31                    $000'S
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 
1996      1995 
Sales.  $30,455     $35,080 
Commissions earned.   3,253      3,189 
There were no commissioned sales in 1994.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
Revenue from product development activities is recognized during the period the
Company performs the development efforts in accordance with the term of the
agreements and activities undertaken. The revenue is recognized ratably over
the term of the agreement, which generally approximates the performance effort. 
Revenue that is related to future performance under such agreements is deferred
and recognized as revenue when earned.
Research and development costs not associated with product development
activities are expensed as incurred. d. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates the fair value. The
Company considers all highly liquid and temporary cash investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company policy
is to place its cash and cash equivalents with large creditworthy financial
institutions and to limit the amount of credit exposure. e. Advances to growers
Advances to growers are made for supplies, seed, and other growing and
harvesting costs. The advances are interest bearing and repaid from amounts
withheld from sales proceeds due to growers. f. Association agreements
The Company has entered into certain participation agreements with growers under
which the Company shares in the profits and losses associated with growing
activities. Since the Company exercises control over the associations, the
Company proportionally consolidates the results of operations of those growing
activities in the results of operations. g. Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by
using the first-in, first-out method for finished produce. Cost of growing
crops includes direct material and labor and an allocation of indirect costs and
are accumulated until the time of the harvest, subject to lower of cost or
market adjustments.                    32 h. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at their acquisition cost. Additions
to property, plant and equipment, including significant improvements and
renewals, are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is computed using straight-line methods over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. i. Patents and trademarks
The costs of obtaining patents are expensed as incurred. Acquired patents and
trademarks are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. 
During 1996, the Company recorded amortization expense of $308,000. j. Research and product development costs
All research and product development costs incurred or acquired are expensed. k. Stock based compensation
As a result of the Merger, DNA Plant Technology Corporation existing stock
option plans were assumed by the Company. In October, 1995, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Statement No. 123 applies to all transactions in which an entity
acquires goods or services by issuing equity instruments such as common stock,
except for employee stock ownership plans. Statement No. 123 establishes a new
method of accounting for stock-based compensation arrangements with employees
which is fair value based. The statement encourages but does not require
employers to adopt the new method in place of the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Companies may continue to apply the accounting provisions of APB No. 25 in
determining net income, however, they must apply the disclosure requirements of
Statement No. 123. If the Company adopts the fair value based method of
Statement No. 123, a higher compensation cost would result for fixed option
plans and a different compensation cost will result for the Company contingent
and variable stock option plans. The recognition provisions and disclosure
requirements of Statement No. 123 are effective January 1, 1996. The Company
plans to use the accounting practice under APB No. 25 previously followed by
DNAP. l. Concentration of credit risks
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of trade receivables and advances to growers. 
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large number
of customers comprising the Company customer base. Concentration of credit
risk associated with advances to growers is limited due to the geographic
dispersion of the growers. However, there can be no assurance that an event
outside the Company control will not occur and cause these advances to be at
risk. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' and
growers' financial condition to determine the need for an allowance for
uncollectible accounts. m. Acquisitions
The underlying assets and liabilities of acquired companies are recorded at fair
market values and the excess purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The
Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the recorded goodwill based
upon projected operating income of the related subsidiary. Goodwill is
amortized over twenty years. Goodwill amortization amounted to $0700 million 0538 million and $0404 million in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.                    33 n. Impairment of long-lived assets
Management periodically reviews for impairment the long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized whenever it is determined that
recoverability is impaired. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived
assets and identifiable intangibles that management expects to hold and use is
based on the fair value of the asset. o. Income taxes
An income tax provision is made using the assets and liability approach. Under
this approach, deferred taxes are provided for the differences between the
financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income
tax expense benefit is the net change during the year in the deferred income
tax asset or liability. Current income tax expense is the amount of income
taxes expected to be payable for the current year. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected
to be realized. p. Fair value of financial instruments
The carrying value of the Company financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables, and advances to growers,
approximate their fair market value due to their short-term maturities. The
carrying value of the Company long-term debt is estimated to approximate its
fair value. q. Translation of financial statements
The financial statements for subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
U.S. dollar are translated in the following manner: assets and liabilities at
the year end rates; stockholders' equity at historical rates and results of
operations at the monthly average exchange rates. The effects of exchange rate
changes are reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
For subsidiaries whose activities are recorded in currencies which are not their
functional currency, the components of the financial statements are translated
as follows BALANCE SHEET:
Current assets, except inventories        year-end
Inventories                   historical   
Liabilities                   year-end
Property, plant and equipment          historical
Stockholders' equity               historical
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:
Sales                      historical
Cost of sales                  historical
Depreciation and amortization          historical
Interest                     monthly average
Other expenses and income            monthly average
Income taxes                   monthly average Gains and losses in remeasurement arise mainly from the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on net monetary items denominated in pesos and are included in
results of operations.                    34 Effective January 1, 1997, Mexico will be considered a hyperinflationary
environment since the cumulative inflation over the last three years has
exceeded 100%. As a result of this, subsidiaries whose functional currency is
the Mexican peso will be required to translate their financial statements in a
manner similar to that utilized by subsidiaries whose activities are recorded in
currencies which are not their functional currencies.
r. Net loss per common share
The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for 1996, giving
retroactive effect to the common shares issued to Bionova upon the contribution
of its interests in the Bionova subsidiaries and shares issued in connection
with the merger, was 14,286,318.
s. Employee benefit plan
DNAP has a savings and retirement plan and trust the 401k Plan available
to all eligible employees of DNAP. An eligible employee may elect to defer, in
the form of contributions to the 401k Plan, between 1% and 15% in 1%
increments of the total compensation that would otherwise be paid to the
employee, subject to annual contribution limitations. An employee
contributions are invested at the direction of the employee in various
investment options and are fully vested and nonforfeitable immediately upon
contribution. The 401k Plan provides for DNAP contributions in the form of
common stock or cash, not to exceed 3% of elective salary deferral
contributions. During the last quarter of 1996 DNAP cash contributions to the
401k Plan were approximately $17,000.
t. Reclassification of costs
Certain financial statement items have been reclassified to conform to the
current year format. The most significant of these items was the
reclassification of distribution costs from selling, general and administrative
expenses to cost of sales. Management believes that this reclassification is a
more accurate reflection of the nature of these expenses in the operations of
the business than the manner in which they had been classified previously. 
During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 distribution costs
amounted to $123 million, $148 million, and $67 million, respectively.
NOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS
During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, Bionova and the Company
acquired control of the following subsidiaries -  During 1994, Bionova made a capital contribution toward the formation of
Premier Fruits & Vegetables BBL, Inc. Premier in the amount of $161,000
in cash, representing an 80% share of the capital stock. This investment
was contributed to IPHC in December, 1994. -  During December 1994, Bionova acquired 51% of IPHC for $22 million in
cash. This U.S. company distributes fresh produce in the United States and
Canada through its subsidiaries, R.B. Packing, Inc., R.B. Packing of
California, Inc., R.B. Packing of Texas, Inc. all 100% owned, Tanimura
Distributing, Inc. 75% owned, Premier 80% owned, and in Europe, the
Middle East, and the Far East through its recent acquisition of Royal Van
Namen discussed below. The goodwill resulting from this 1994 acquisition
amounted to $675,000. -  In January 1995, ABSA acquired a 5001% stake in Interfruver de Mexico,
S.A. de C.V. Interfruver, a Mexican distributor of fresh produce, for
$2055 million in cash, resulting in the recognition of goodwill of $194
million. The agreement to acquire Interfruver established that, in
addition to the purchase price mentioned above, a contingent payout of $20
million could be due to the sellers the minority stockholders on an earn
out basis over a four-year period beginning in 1995. This contingent
payment, if any, will result in an adjustment of the original purchase
price and a corresponding increase in goodwill and related                    35   amortization in the future. No amounts were due or paid in 1995 under this
agreement. The amount for 1996 has not yet been determined by the Company.
The following table summarizes the net investment by Bionova in the subsidiaries
acquired through December 31, 1995, which were contributed to the Company in
1996.

These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method. The companies
are included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of their
acquisition. Tanimura and Premier had no operations prior to their formation
with Bionova as the controlling stockholder. -  In November 1996, IPHC acquired a 51% stake in Royal Van Namen Van Namen,
a distributor of fresh produce located in The Netherlands, for $1475
million in cash, resulting in the recognition of minimal goodwill. Under
the terms of the purchase agreement, a contingent pay out of as much as
$1945 million could be due to the sellers the minority stockholders on
an earn out basis over a four-year period beginning in 1997 based on prior
year earnings before interest and taxes from the results of operations. 
This contingent payment, if any, will result in an adjustment of the
original purchase price and a corresponding increase in goodwill and
related amortization in the future. The amount for 1996 has not yet been
determined by the Company.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information assumes that the Merger
and Van Namen acquisition occurred at the beginning of 1996 and 1995 and gives
effect to certain adjustments, including depreciation and amortization of the
assets acquired, amortization of goodwill, and related income tax effects.

The Company has agreements with certain produce growers in Mexico and in the
United States, whereby a significant portion of growing costs are paid in
advance by the Company. The growing costs are recorded as advances to growers
and are recognized as a component of cost of produce sales when the produce is
sold. The advances in Mexico $4979 million and $5689 million at December 31,
1996 and 1995, respectively in some cases are secured by promissory notes
and/or the right to use the acreage of the grower if the advances are not
repaid. Advances to growers in the United States $1209 million and $2200
million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively are generally not
collateralized.
Advances earned interest at 12% per annum. Interest income from these advances
amounted to $0884 million, $0811 million, and $0279 million during the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.                    37 NOTE 6 - INVENTORIES Inventories were comprised of the following                                $000'S

Short-term bank loans consist of amounts due to banks, denominated in U.S.
dollars, under various lines of credit facilities. The lines of credit contain
certain covenants which, among other things, require maintenance of certain
ratio levels and tangible net worth levels. The Company is in compliance with
those covenants. The lines of credit bear interest at prime 81% and 85% at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Various bank credit facilities are available with banks whereby the Company may
borrow upon such terms as the subsidiaries and banks mutually agree. At
December 31, 1996, such bank credit facilities amounted to $42645 million, of
which $10535 million was not used.
The amounts due under bank credit facilities with Mexican banks are generally
renewable at the discretion of the banks. The Company has informal arrangements
with these banks which permit additional borrowings, subject to the availability
of funds by the banks.
ELM and the minority shareholders of ABSA and IPHC provide certain guarantees 
on both the short-term and long-term bank debt. At December 31, 1996, ELM 
guaranteed $20 million of this debt, and ELM and the minority shareholders 
guaranteed on a 50/50 basis all otherwise unsecured bank debt. ELM is 
obligated under the terms of the Merger through September, 1999 to provide 
under certain conditions a guarantee of indebtedness of the Company of up to 
$20 million to a financial institution under a loan or a line of credit.
LONG-TERM LOANS

first four years of operation. This tax, once applicable, is due if federal
income taxes are not in excess of the asset tax. It can be recovered in future
years from taxes on future income in excess of future asset tax.
At December 31, 1996 the Company had total tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $505 million. Tax loss carryforwards from the Company Mexican
subsidiaries can be inflation-indexed in Mexico until the date of their
application against future taxable profits. The tax loss carryforwards expire
from 2004 to 2011. The tax loss carryforwards are contained in the Company
Mexican subsidiaries $231 million, U.S. subsidiaries $263 million, and
other foreign subsidiaries $11 million.
DNAP had tax loss carryforwards at the date of the merger whose utilization is
limited to $251 million. A full valuation allowance has been provided with
respect to these tax loss carryforwards.
NOTE 10 - STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
STOCK OPTION PLANS
As a result of the Merger the Company assumed DNAP existing stock option
plans. The number of shares and option exercise prices were adjusted to give
effect to the exchange ratio stipulated in the merger agreement. The three
plans are the 1986 Stock Option Plan the 1986 Plan, the 1994 Stock Option
Plan the 1994 Plan, and the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the
Directors' Plan, under which a maximum of 160,000, 300,000 and 80,000 shares
of common stock, respectively, are available for issuance. Approximately 52,072
options were outstanding at December 31, 1996 under three other stock option
plans. It is not anticipated that any further grants will be awarded under
these plans.
The 1986 Plan and the 1994 Plan provided for the granting of incentive stock
options, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code, and non-qualified stock
options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights to officers and
employees of, and consultants and advisors to DNAP and now the Company, at
prices which were generally not less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant and expiring ten years from the date of grant.                    41 The Directors' Plan provided for initial and annual grants of non-qualified
stock options to each non-employee director at prices which were equal to 90%
and 100%, respectively, of the fair market value of DNAP and now the
Company common stock on the date of grant and expiring ten years from the
date of grant. An initial director option became exercisable in five equal
annual installments, beginning one year from the date of grant, and the annual
awards became fully exercisable within one year from the date of grant.

the date of the merger is as follows                           DECEMBER 31,

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
Had compensation cost for the Company option plans been determined based on
the fair value at the grant dates, as prescribed in Statement No. 123, the
Company net loss and net loss per share would not have been materially
different than the reported amounts.
WARRANTS
At December 31, 1996 the Company had the following warrants and options
outstanding, which it assumed in connection with the merger                   42  Number of

During 1995, DNAP issued common stock with warrants that expire during the third
and fourth quarters of 2000, and which entitle the holders to purchase an
additional 407,018 shares of common stock at $2500 per share. As part of the
compensation to the consultant who assisted DNAP in placing these securities,
DNAP granted the consultant unit purchase options to purchase 72,500 placement
units at $1750 per unit. Each placement unit consists of one share of common
stock and a warrant entitling the holder to purchase during the year following
the exercise of the unit purchase options, one half share of common stock
36,250 in total if all unit purchase options are exercised for $1750 per
share.
NOTE 11 - BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
ELM CREDIT LINE
The short-term accounts payable to related parties shown in the consolidated
balance sheet bears interest at variable rates comparable to those prevailing in
the market place. The debt with related parties arose from the long-term credit
line made available to affiliates of ELM and bears interest at variable rates
similar to those prevailing in the market place. At December 31, 1996, $2461
million was outstanding under this arrangement. During 1996 and 1995, the
Company incurred interest expense of $0310 million and $0223 million,
respectively.

in January, 1997. Seminis and DNAP presently are engaged in discussions to
finalize the list of research projects that will be worked upon along with the
terms of their contract under this agreement. The final contract between
these two parties is expected to be signed in April, 1997. Several other
affiliates of ELM have entered into discussions with DNAP to identify

funded research agreement.

connection with a special incentive program sponsored by the various Mexican
government and banking institutions for companies in the agriculture, fishing,
and forestry industries. The subsidy received was determined using specified
formulas based on ABSA debt outstanding as of June 30, 1996 and the repayments
of principal and interest made by ABSA from July 1 through December 31, 1996.
NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
CONTINGENCIES  -  R.B. Packing, Inc., a subsidiary of IPHC, was audited by the Internal
Revenue Service for 1991, 1992, and 1993. The IRS has asserted that the
sales commissions charged to ABSA are too low. The company believes that
the sales commissions charged between related parties are reasonable and
supportable. The IRS also has asserted that certain travel and expense
charges lack substantiation and that insufficient business purpose has been
put forward for certain advertising and interest expenses. The Company
believes that these expenses also are reasonable and supportable. The
Appeals Division of the IRS recently filed a 30 day notice regarding the
three years under consideration and recited a proposed deficiency of
$941,000 in tax and $188,000 in penalties. This initial IRS proposal
disallows certain business expenses in full and adjusts commission rates to
amounts well in excess of market rates. The Company intends to defend its
position vigorously, and on the belief that any final tax and penalty that
might ultimately be assessed will be immaterial, no provision has been made
to the financial statements. -  On January 21, 1997, a class action lawsuit was filed by Gordon K. Aaron
and Fay H. Aaron against ELM, Bionova, Alfonso Romo Garza, Bionova
International, Inc., the Company, Robert Serenbetz, Gerald Laubach, Evelyn
Berezin, and Douglas Luke, Jr. in the U.S. federal district court for the
Northern District of California. The plaintiffs allege that they were
owners of shares of DNAP $225 convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock
Preferred Stock prior to the Merger and that they were entitled to
receive more consideration for their Preferred Stock than was provided to
them under the Merger Agreement. Specifically                   45   the plaintiffs allege that i they were denied the rights they allegedly
had under the terms of the Preferred Stock to vote on the Merger; 
ii defendants Serenbetz, Laubach, Luke, and Berezin the Individual 
Defendants, each of whom was a director of DNAP prior to the Merger 
and currently serves as a director of the Company, breached fiduciary 
duties of loyalty, candor and care allegedly owed to DNAP and its 
stockholders, iii all of the defendants aided, knew of or recklessly 
disregarded, and all of the defendants substantially assisted, the 
conduct giving rise to the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by the 
Individual Defendants; and iv each of ELM, Bionova, the Registrant 
and Alfonso Romo Garza had knowledge of the alleged contractual duties 
allegedly owed by DNAP to the plaintiffs and each of such defendants 
intentionally caused DNAP to breach such alleged duties. The plaintiffs
claim to have been damaged by the alleged actions of the defendants and 
therefore the plaintiffs seek unspecified actual and punitive damages 
as well as reimbursement of their litigation costs and expenses. The 
Company believes the claims of the plaintiffs are without merit and 
intends to vigorously defend against these claims. -  In a complaint dated August 5, 1996 and filed in the Superior Court for the
County of Los Angeles, California, the County of Los Angeles sued DNAP and
others, including several cigarette manufacturers, alleging breach of
express warranty, unlawful, deceptive and unfair business practices, fraud
and misrepresentation, and conspiracy, in connection with the manufacture,
promotion, distribution and sale of tobacco products. DNAP involvement
in the suit arises from allegations regarding research it performed for a
major tobacco company. The County of Los Angeles is seeking economic
damages and injunctive relief. DNAP denies any wrongdoing or liability in
this matter and intends to vigorously contest this lawsuit. -  A former executive of FreshWorld Farms, a subsidiary of DNAP, has
threatened to institute arbitration with respect to the termination of his
employment. The Company believes his allegations are without merit and
intends to vigorously defend itself if such a proceeding is commenced. -  On September 25, 1996 a court in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico ruled that
Olga Elena Batiz Esquer did not have legal title to one hundred hectares
approximately 247 acres of land that she purported to transfer to ABSA on
June 2, 1990. This decision was made in concert with a ruling from a
petition originally presented in 1964 that the former owner of the subject
land owned rural land in excess of the maximum that was then allowed by law
in 1964, and that therefore the land rightfully belonged to the
petitioners. On October 23, 1996 Ms. Batiz filed a challenge to this
ruling. If ABSA is ultimately required to transfer the subject land, which
constitutes approximately 9% of the total land owned by ASBA, Mexican law
gives ABSA indemnification rights against Ms. Batiz. COMMITMENTS -
