Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific information
regarding the Company asset divestitures.
The Company anticipates that it will continue to sell non-strategic
properties from time to time to increase capital resources available for other
activities, to achieve operating and administrative efficiencies and to improve
profitability.
Acquisition activities. The Company regularly seeks to acquire properties
that  complement its  operations,  provide  exploration  and  development
opportunities and potentially provide superior returns on investment. In
addition, the Company pursues strategic acquisitions that will allow the Company
to expand into new geographical areas that feature producing properties and
provide exploration/exploitation  opportunities.  During 2000, the Company
expended $672 million to acquire proved and unproved oil and gas properties.
Strategic acquisitions of proved properties during 2000 included incremental
working interests in the United States Gulf of Mexico discovery at Devils Tower
and the Canadian Chinchaga field. The Company also acquired an interest in the
Camden Hills Gulf of Mexico discovery during 2000. During 1999, the Company
acquired Argentine proved and unproved oil and gas properties that complement
its existing operations in Argentina. The Company paid $388 million of cash for
the Argentine assets during the fourth quarter of 1999, of which amount $25
million was cash consideration paid for unproved Argentine oil and gas
properties.
The Company regularly evaluates and pursues acquisition opportunities
including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas properties or related
assets; entities owning oil and gas properties or related assets; and,
opportunities  to engage in mergers,  consolidations  or other  business
combinations with such entities and at any given time may be in various stages
of evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of internal
6 financial analysis, oil and gas reserve analysis, due diligence, the submission
of an indication of interest, preliminary negotiations, negotiation of a letter
of intent or negotiation of a definitive agreement.
Operations by Geographic Area
The Company operates in one industry segment. During 2000, 1999 and 1998,
the Company principally had oil and gas producing activities in the United
States, Argentina and Canada; and, had exploration activities in the United
States Gulf Coast area, the Gulf of Mexico, Argentina, Canada, South Africa and
Gabon. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for geographic operating
segment information, including results of operations and segment assets.
Marketing of Production
General. Production from the Company properties is marketed consistent
with industry practices. Sales prices for oil, NGL and gas production are
negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as the
spot price for gas or the posted price for oil, price regulations, distance from
the well to the pipeline, well pressure, estimated reserves, commodity quality
and prevailing supply conditions.
Significant Purchasers. During 2000, the Company primary purchaser of
oil was ExxonMobil Corporation ExxonMobil, the Company primary purchaser
of natural gas liquids was Williams Energy Services Williams and the
Company  primary purchaser of gas was Anadarko  Petroleum  Corporation
Anadarko. Approximately eight percent, 13 percent and six percent of the
Company 2000 combined oil, NGL and gas revenues were attributable to sales to
ExxonMobil, Williams and Anadarko, respectively. The Company is of the opinion
that the loss of any one purchaser would not have an adverse effect on its
ability to sell its oil, NGL and gas production.
Hedging Activities. The Company periodically enters into commodity
derivative contracts swaps and collars in order to i reduce the effect of
the volatility of price changes on the commodities the Company produces and
sells, ii support the Company annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans
and iii lock in prices to protect the economics related to certain capital
projects. See Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the Company hedging
activities, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk and Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a description of the
Company open hedge positions at December 31, 2000 and related prices.
Competition, Markets and Regulation
Competition. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. A large
number of companies and individuals  engage in the exploration for and
development of oil and gas properties, and there is a high degree of competition
for oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration. Acquisitions
of oil and gas properties have been an important element of the Company
growth, and the Company intends to continue to acquire oil and gas properties.
The principal competitive factors in the acquisition of oil and gas properties
include the staff and data necessary to identify, investigate and purchase such
properties and the financial resources necessary to acquire and develop them.
Many of the Company competitors are substantially larger and have financial
and other resources greater than those of the Company.
Markets. The Company ability to produce and market oil and gas
profitably depends on numerous factors beyond the Company control. The effect
of these factors cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Although the
Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect oil and gas
prices or the degree to which oil and gas prices will be affected, the prices
for any oil or gas that the Company produces will generally approximate current
market prices in the geographic region.
Governmental  Regulation.  Oil and gas  exploration and production
operations are subject to various types of regulation by local, state, federal
and foreign agencies. The Company operations are also subject to state
conservation laws and regulations, including provisions for the unitization or
pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of
7 production from wells and the regulation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of
wells. Each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect
to production and sale of oil and gas within their respective jurisdictions. The
regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the Company cost of
doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas
industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the Federal Energy
Regulatory  Commission,  state regulatory bodies, the courts and foreign
governments. The Company cannot predict when or if any such proposals might
become effective or their effect, if any, on the Company operations.
Environmental and Health Controls. The Company operations are subject
to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to
environmental and health protection. These laws and regulations may require the
acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the type, quantities
and concentration of various  substances that can be released into the
environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or
prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands
and other protected areas and impose substantial liabilities for pollution
resulting from oil and gas operations. These laws and regulations may also
restrict air emissions or other discharges resulting from the operation of
natural gas processing plants, pipeline systems and other facilities that the
Company owns. Although the Company believes that compliance with environmental
laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations or financial condition, risks of substantial costs and liabilities
are inherent in oil and gas operations, and there can be no assurance that
significant costs and liabilities, including potential criminal penalties, will
not be incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as
stricter environmental laws and regulations or claims for damages to property or
persons resulting from the Company operations, could result in substantial
costs and liabilities.
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes liability, without regard
to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons
with respect to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment.
These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where
the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of
hazardous substances released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible
for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and
several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that
have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources,
and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to
file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the
hazardous substances released into the environment.
The Company generates wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are
subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA and
comparable state statutes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and various
state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by the
Company oil and gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as
hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, and
therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal
requirements.
The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past owned or
leased, properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and
production of oil and gas. Although the Company has used operating and disposal
practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other
wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or
leased by the Company or on or under other locations where such wastes have been
taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by
third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other
wastes was not under the Company control. These properties and the wastes
disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under
such laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously
disposed wastes or property contamination or to perform remedial plugging
operations to prevent future contamination.
Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities
that store or otherwise handle oil, such as the Company, to prepare and
implement spill prevention control plans, countermeasure plans, and facility
response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters.
The Oil Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 OPA amends certain provisions of
8 the federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, commonly referred to as the
Clean Water Act CWA, and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of
and response to oil spills into navigable waters. The OPA subjects owners of
facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup
costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited
to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. The CWA
provides penalties for any discharges of petroleum products in reportable
quantities and imposes substantial liability for the costs of removing a spill.
OPA requires responsible parties to establish and maintain evidence of financial
responsibility to cover removal costs and damages resulting from an oil spill.
OPA calls for a financial responsibility of $35 million to cover pollution
cleanup for offshore facilities. State laws for the control of water pollution
also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of
releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground.
The Company does not believe that the OPA, CWA or related state laws are any
more burdensome to it than they are to other similarly situated oil and gas
companies.
Many states in which the Company operates have recently begun to regulate
naturally occurring radioactive materials NORM and NORM wastes that are
generated in connection with oil and gas exploration and production activities.
NORM wastes typically consist of very low-level radioactive substances that
become concentrated in pipe scale and in production equipment. State regulations
may require the testing of pipes and production equipment for the presence of
NORM, the licensing of NORM-contaminated facilities and the careful handling and
disposal of NORM wastes. The Company believes that the growing regulation of
NORM will have a minimal effect on the Company operations because the Company
generates only a very small quantity of NORM on an annual basis.
The Company does not believe that its environmental risks are materially
different from those of comparable companies in the oil and gas industry.
Nevertheless, no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not, in the
future, result in a curtailment of production or processing or a material
increase in the costs of production, development, exploration or processing or
otherwise adversely affect the Company results of operations and financial
condition.
The Company  employs an  environmental  manager and  environmental
specialists charged with monitoring environmental and regulatory compliance. The
Company performs an environmental review as part of the due diligence work on
potential acquisitions, including acquisitions of oil and gas properties. The
Company is not aware of any material environmental legal proceedings pending
against it or any material environmental liabilities to which it may be subject.
Risks Associated with Business Activities
The nature of the business activities conducted by the Company subjects
it to certain hazards and risks. The following is a summary of some of the
material risks relating to the Company business activities.
Commodity Prices. The Company revenues, profitability, cash flow and
future rate of growth are highly dependent on prices of oil and gas, which are
affected by numerous factors beyond the Company control. Oil and gas prices
historically have been very volatile. A resumption of the significant downward
trend in oil and gas prices experienced in 1998, as compared to 2000 and 1999,
would have a material adverse effect on the Company revenues, profitability
and cash flow and could, under certain circumstances, result in a reduction in
the carrying value of the Company oil and gas properties and an increase in
the Company deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Drilling Activities. Drilling involves numerous risks, including the
risk that no commercially productive gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered.
The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and
drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a
variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or
irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather
conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. The Company
future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such
failure could have an adverse effect on the Company future results of
operations and financial condition. While all drilling, whether developmental or
exploratory, involves these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks
of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Because
of the percentage of the Company capital budget devoted to exploratory
projects, it is likely that the Company will continue to experience exploration
and abandonment expense.
9    Unproved Properties. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company carried
unproved property costs of $2292 million and $2576 million, respectively.
United States generally accepted  accounting  principles require periodic
evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis in comparison to their
estimated value. These evaluations will be affected by results of exploration
activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all
or a portion of the leases, contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects.
If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not
sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will
recognize non-cash charges in the earnings of future periods. During 1999 and
1998, the Company recognized non-cash impairment provisions of $179 million and
$1473 million, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of its unproved
properties see Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Acquisitions. Acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties have been
a key element of the Company growth. The Company growth following the full
development of its existing property base could be impeded if it is unable to
acquire additional oil and gas properties on a profitable basis. The success of
any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to
estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future
production and future net revenues attributable to reserves and to assess
possible environmental liabilities. All of these factors affect whether an
acquisition will ultimately generate cash flows sufficient to provide a suitable
return on investment. Even though the Company performs a review of the
properties it seeks to acquire that it believes is consistent with industry
practices, such reviews are often limited in scope.
Divestitures. The Company regularly reviews its property base for the
purpose of identifying non-strategic assets, the disposition of which would
increase  capital  resources  available for other  activities and create
organizational and operational efficiencies. Various factors could materially
affect the ability of the Company to dispose of non-strategic assets, including
the availability of purchasers willing to purchase the non-strategic assets at
prices acceptable to the Company.
Operation of Natural Gas Processing Plants. As of December 31, 2000, the
Company owns interests in nine natural gas processing plants and four treating
facilities. The Company operates six of the plants and all four treating
facilities. There are significant risks associated with the operation of natural
gas processing plants. Gas and natural gas liquids are volatile and explosive
and may include carcinogens. Damage to or misoperation of a natural gas
processing plant or facility could result in an explosion or the discharge of
toxic gases, which could result in significant damage claims in addition to
interrupting a revenue source.
Operating Hazards and Uninsured Losses. The Company operations are
subject to all the risks normally incident to the oil and gas exploration and
production business, including blowouts, cratering, explosions and pollution and
other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to
the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells,
production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory
investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company
currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is
similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and gas industry,
it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, either because such
insurance is not available or because of high premium costs.
Environmental. The oil and gas business is also subject to environmental
hazards, such as oil spills, gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of toxic
substances or gases that could expose the Company to substantial liability due
to pollution and other environmental damage. A variety of federal, state and
foreign laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of the oil and gas
business. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject the Company
to penalties, damages or other liabilities, and compliance may increase the cost
of the Company operations. Such laws and regulations may also affect the costs
of acquisitions. See Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulation -
Environmental and Health Controls.
The Company does not believe that its environmental risks are materially
different from those of comparable companies in the oil and gas industry.
Nevertheless, no assurance can be given that future environmental laws will not
result in a curtailment of production or processing or a material increase in
the costs of production, development, exploration or processing or otherwise
10 adversely affect the Company operations and financial condition. Pollution and
similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.
Debt Restrictions and Availability. The Company is a borrower under fixed
term senior notes and a line of credit. The terms of the Company borrowings
under the senior notes and the line of credit specify scheduled debt repayments
and require the Company to comply with certain associated covenants and
restrictions. The Company ability to comply with the debt repayment terms,
associated covenants and restrictions is dependent on, among other things,
factors outside the Company direct control, such as commodity prices, interest
rates and competition for available debt financing. See Note D of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for information regarding the Company outstanding debt and
the terms associated therewith.
Competition. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company
competes with other companies, producers and operators for acquisitions and in
the exploration, development, production and marketing of oil and gas. Some of
these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than
the Company. See Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulation.
Government Regulation. The Company business is regulated by a variety
of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no
assurance that present or future regulations will not adversely affect the
Company business and operations. See Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets
and Regulation.
International Operations. At December 31, 2000, approximately 22 percent
of the Company proved reserves of oil, NGLs and gas were located outside the
United States 17 percent in Argentina, four percent in Canada and one percent
in South Africa. The success and profitability of international operations may
be adversely affected by risks associated with international activities,
including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws
including United States taxes on foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value
of the United States dollar versus the local currency in which oil and gas are
sold. To the extent that the Company is involved in international activities,
changes in exchange rates may adversely affect the Company consolidated
revenues and expenses as expressed in United States dollars.
Estimates of Reserves and Future Net Revenues. Numerous uncertainties
exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues
therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future net revenues set
forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately
prove to be inaccurate. Therefore, such estimates should not be construed as
accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company proved reserves.
ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
The information included in this Report about the Company oil, NGL and
gas reserves at December 31, 2000, including Standardized Measure, is based on
proved reserves as determined by the Company engineers.
Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves
and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development
expenditures, including many factors beyond the Company control. This Report
contains estimates of the Company proved oil and gas reserves and the related
future net revenues, which are based on various assumptions, including those
prescribed by the SEC. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues,
taxes, capital expenditures, operating expenses, geologic success and quantities
of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in
the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and related
Standardized Measure of proved reserves set forth in this Report. In addition,
the Company reserves may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on
production performance, purchases or sales of properties, results of future
development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors. Therefore,
estimates of the Standardized Measure of proved reserves should not be construed
as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company proved
reserves.
Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common
basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations
of the SEC. It requires the use of oil and gas prices prevailing as of the date
of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received
11 or that will be received for oil and gas because of seasonal price fluctuations
or other varying market conditions. Standardized Measures as of any date are not
necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Accordingly, estimates
included herein of future net revenues may be materially different from the net
revenues that are ultimately received.
The Company did not provide estimates of total proved oil and gas
reserves during 2000 to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC.
Proved Reserves
The Company proved reserves totaled 6282 million BOE at December 31,
2000, 6055 million BOE at December 31, 1999 and 6768 million BOE at December
31, 1998,  representing  $56  billion,  $29 billion and $16 billion,
respectively, of Standardized Measure. The four percent increase in proved
reserves in 2000 was primarily attributable to the Company successful capital
investments, while the 93 percent increase in Standardized Measure during 2000
was primarily due to increases in commodity prices. The divestiture of oil and
gas properties, partially offset by upward revisions of reserve quantities as a
result of increases in commodity prices, was the primary reason for the decrease
in reserves during 1999.
On a BOE basis, 77 percent of the Company total proved reserves at
December 31, 2000 are proved developed reserves. Based on reserve information as
of December 31, 2000, and using the Company reserve report production
information for 2001, the reserve-to-production ratio associated with the
Company proved reserves is 14 years on a BOE basis. The following table
provides information regarding the Company proved reserves and average daily
production by geographic area as of and for the year ended December 31, 2000.       PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND AVERAGE DAILY PRODUCTION

a The 2000 average daily production is calculated using a 366-day year and
without making pro forma adjustments for any acquisitions, divestitures or
drilling activity that occurred during the year. Reserve Replacement
During 2000, the Company proved reserves increased by 227 MMBOE as
compared to a decline of 714 MMBOE during 1999. The Company additions to
proved reserves during 2000 were comprised of 275 MMBOE of upward revisions to
previous estimates, 380 MMBOE of new discoveries and extensions and 74 MMBOE
of asset purchases. Proved reserves declined by 501 MMBOE during 2000 due to
current year production of 436 MMBOE and asset divestitures of 66 MMBOE. The
positive revisions of 2000 were split between changes in estimates of future
quantities  available for production and changes in estimates of future
quantities from improved commodity prices. The Company added 911 MMBOE of
proved reserves during 1999 from revisions of previous estimates of 744 MMBOE,
purchases of minerals-in-place of 73 MMBOE and new discoveries and extensions
of 94 MMBOE. Proved reserve reductions during 1999 were comprised of 1114
MMBOE from asset divestitures and 511 MMBOE of 1999 production. The positive
impact of revisions in 1999 primarily resulted from improved commodity prices as
compared to December 31, 1998 prices. The downward revisions in 1998 relate
primarily to the lower commodity prices as of December 31, 1998, as compared to
December 31, 1997. The Company reserves as of December 31, 2000 were estimated
using the WTI Cushing, Oklahoma spot oil price of $2669 per Bbl and the Henry
Hub, Louisiana gas spot price of $995 per Mcf, resulting in average realized
prices of $2571 per Bbl of oil, $1674 per Bbl of NGLs and $750 per Mcf of gas
12 after normal quality, gathering and transportation adjustments. The Company
reserves as of December 31, 1999 were estimated using the WTI Cushing, Oklahoma
spot oil price of $2560 per Bbl and the Henry Hub, Louisiana gas spot price of
$233 per Mcf, resulting in average realized prices of $2433 per Bbl of oil 1759 per Bbl of NGLs and $183 per Mcf of gas after normal quality, gathering
and transportation adjustments. As prices increase or decrease in future
periods, reserves will be revised upward or downward for quantities which become
economical or uneconomical to produce under the new price assumptions.
During 2000, the Company replaced 167 percent of its annual production on
a BOE basis 196 percent for oil and NGLs and 140 percent for gas. During 1999,
the Company replaced 178 percent of its annual production on a BOE basis 262
percent for oil and NGLs and 99 percent for gas. The Company 2000 and 1999
reserve replacement were primarily impacted by the increase in commodity prices.
On a BOE basis, the Company 1998 reserve replacement rate was negative due to
severe declines in commodity  prices which resulted in downward reserve
revisions.
Finding Cost
The Company acquisition and finding costs per BOE for 2000 and 1999
were $466 and $221 per BOE, respectively. During 1998, the Company
acquisition and finding costs were negative. The negative rate in 1998 was a
result of downward reserve revisions related to the decline in commodity prices
during 1998. The average acquisition and finding cost for the three-year period
from 1998 to 2000 was $694 per BOE, representing a 17 percent decline from the
1999 three-year average rate of $836.
Description of Properties
As of December 31, 2000, the Company has operations in the United States,
Argentina and Canada, and exploration opportunities in South Africa and Gabon.
Domestic. The Company domestic operations are located in the Permian
Basin, Mid Continent and Gulf Coast areas of the United States. Approximately 86
percent of the Company domestic proved reserves are located in the Spraberry,
Hugoton and West Panhandle fields. These mature fields generate substantial
operating cash flow and have a portfolio of low risk infill  drilling
opportunities. The cash flows generated from these fields provide funding for
the Company other development and exploration activities both domestically and
internationally. During 2000, the Company expended $1199 million in domestic
exploration and development drilling activities. The Company has budgeted
approximately $260 million for domestic exploration and development drilling
expenditures for 2001.
Spraberry  field. The Spraberry field was discovered in 1949 and
encompasses eight counties in West Texas. The field is approximately 150 miles
long and 75 miles wide at its widest point. The oil produced is West Texas
Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average Btu
content of 1,400 Btu per Mcf. The oil and gas are produced from three
formations, the upper and lower Spraberry and the Dean, at depths ranging from
6,700 feet to 9,200 feet. The center of the Spraberry field was unitized in the
late 1950 and early 1960 by the major oil companies; however, until the late
1980 there was very limited development activity in the field. Since 1989, the
Company has focused on acquisition and development drilling activities in the
unitized portion of the Spraberry field due to the dormant condition of the
properties and the high net revenue interests available. The Company believes
the area offers excellent opportunities to enhance oil and gas reserves because
of the hundreds of undeveloped infill drilling locations and the ability to
reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.
During 2000, the Company placed 86 Spraberry wells on production, drilled
one developmental dry hole and, at December 31, 2000, had 40 wells in progress.
The Company plans to drill approximately 140 additional wells in 2001.
Hugoton field. The Hugoton field in Southwest Kansas is one of the
largest producing gas fields in the continental United States. The gas is
produced from the Chase and Council Grove formations at depths ranging from
2,700 feet to 3,000 feet. The Company  Hugoton  properties  represent
approximately 13 percent of the proved reserves in the field and are located on
approximately 257,000 gross acres 237,000 net acres, covering approximately
400 square miles. The Company has working interests in approximately 1,200 wells
13 in the Hugoton field, 985 of which it operates, and partial royalty interests in
approximately 500 wells. The Company owns substantially all of the gathering and
processing facilities, primarily the Satanta plant, that service its production
from the Hugoton field. Such ownership allows the Company to control the
production, gathering, processing and sale of its gas and associated NGLs.
Production in the Hugoton field is subject to allowables set by state
regulators, but the Company Hugoton operated wells are capable of producing
approximately 150 MMcf of wet gas per day i.e., gas production at the wellhead
before processing and before reduction for royalties. The Company estimates
that it and other major producers in the Hugoton field produced at or near
capacity in 2000. During 2000, the Company completed two development wells in
the Hugoton field. The Company plans to drill approximately 25 Hugoton
development wells in 2001.
The Company is planning to submit an  application to the Kansas
Corporation  Commission to allow infill drilling into the Council Grove
Formation. The Company believes that such infill drilling could increase
production from its Hugoton properties. There can be no assurance that the
application will be filed or approved, or as to the timing of such approval if
granted.
West Panhandle field. The West Panhandle properties are located in the
panhandle region of Texas where initial production commenced in 1918. These
stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite,
Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500
feet. The Company gas in the West Panhandle field has an average Btu content
of 1,300 Btu per Mcf and is produced from approximately 600 wells on more than
241,000 gross 185,000 net acres covering over 375 square miles. The Company
wellhead gas produced from the West Panhandle field contains a high quantity of
NGLs, yielding relatively greater NGL volumes than realized from many other gas
fields. The Company operates the wells and production equipment and Colorado
Interstate Gas Company a subsidiary of El Paso Energy Corp. owns and operates
the gathering system. The production from the West Panhandle field is processed
through the Company-owned Fain natural gas processing plant.
During 2000, the Company placed 51 new wells on production and has three
additional wells in progress at December 31, 2000. The Company plans to drill
approximately 59 wells in 2001.
Other domestic properties. In the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas,
the Company is focused on reserve and production growth through a balanced
portfolio of development and exploration activities. To accomplish this, the
Company has devoted most of its domestic exploration efforts to these areas, as
well as its investment in and utilization of 3-D seismic technology. During
2000, the Company expended $829 million to drill 17 development and 13
exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas. The Company
development of the Canyon Express gas project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is
progressing as planned, with first production anticipated in mid-2002. The
Company also expects to begin development of its deepwater Gulf of Mexico Devils
Tower project during 2001, with first oil production expected in late 2002 or
early 2003. The Company has budgeted approximately $66 million of 2001
development capital for the Canyon Express and Devils Tower projects. Also in
the Gulf of Mexico, the Company-operated well at Eugene Island 208 was
successfully completed with multiple oil and gas pays and tested at a combined
gross rate of production of 1,250 barrels of oil per day and 950 Mcf per day.
The Company has a 75 percent working interest in Eugene Island 208. During 2000,
the Company also announced the completion of the High Island Block 582 A#4 well,
which encountered over 230 feet of pay. The Company has a 55 percent working
interest in the High Island Block 582 A #4 well, which was drilled to a total
depth of 15,147 feet.
In the East Texas Bossier gas play, the Company expects to invest
approximately $37 million of 2001 capital to drill 25 operated and 12
non-operated wells. Additionally, in the South Texas Gulf Coast area, the
Company exploitation efforts in the Pawnee field have increased production
from the field by over 135 percent since December 1999, to approximately 26 MMcf
per day in December 2000. Utilizing advanced 3-D seismic modeling in this
Edwards Reef play, the Company has completed eight horizontal reentries and four
new horizontal wells. Five new wells and two horizontal reentries are scheduled
for 2001 in the Edwards Reef. The Company is also expanding its Edwards Reef
development program to include surrounding fields that could add a significant
number of new locations.
International. The Company international operations are located in the
Neuquen Basin and Tierra del Fuego areas of Argentina and the Chinchaga, Martin
Creek and Rycroft/Spirit River areas of Canada. Additionally, the Company has
14 entered into agreements to explore for oil and gas reserves in South Africa and
Gabon. Approximately 17 percent, four percent and one percent of the Company
proved reserves are located in Argentina, Canada and South Africa, respectively.
Argentina. The Company Argentine properties are primarily located in
the Neuquen and Austral basins. The Company share of Argentine production
during 2000 averaged 256 MBOE per day, or approximately 22 percent of the
Company equivalent production.
The Company operated production in Argentina is concentrated in the
Neuquen Basin which is located about 925 miles southwest of Buenos Aires and
just to the east of the Andes Mountains. Oil and gas are produced primarily from
the Loma Negra/NI Block, the Dadin Block, the Al Norte de la Dorsal Block, the
Neuquen del Medio Block, the Al Sur de la Dorsal Block and the Estacion
Fernandez Oro Block in which the Company has 100 percent working interests. The
Company acquired its working interests in the Al Sur de la Dorsal Block and the
Estacion Fernandez Oro Block during 1999.
The production concession in the Austral basin is located in Tierra del
Fuego, which is an island in the extreme southern portion of Argentina,
approximately 1,500 miles south of Buenos Aires. Oil, gas and NGLs are produced
from six separate fields in which the Company has a 35 percent working interest.
Production increases are anticipated from the area through exploitation and
exploration  and improving the oil and gas  processing  facilities  and
infrastructure on the island. Currently, production is being sent to the
mainland through oil tankers and gas pipelines and exported to Chile through
pipelines.
During 2000, the Company expended $628 million on Argentine exploration
and development activities and drilled 30 development wells and 54 exploratory
wells in Argentina, of which 28 development wells and 38 exploratory wells were
successful. The Company plans to spend approximately $87 million on oil and gas
development and exploration opportunities in Argentina during 2001.
Canada. The Company Canadian producing properties are located primarily
in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada. Production during 2000 averaged 91
MBOE per day, or approximately eight percent of the Company equivalent
production. The Company continues to focus its development, exploration and
acquisition activities in the core areas of northeast British Columbia and
northwest Alberta. The core Canadian assets are geographically concentrated,
predominantly shallow gas and more than 90 percent operated by the Company in
the following areas: Chinchaga, Martin Creek and Rycroft/Spirit River.
Production from the Chinchaga areas is relatively dry gas from formation
depths averaging 3,400 feet. In the Martin Creek area, production is relatively
dry gas from various reservoirs ranging from 3,700 feet to 4,300 feet. The
Rycroft/Spirit River area produces primarily oil and consists of four unitized
waterfloods producing from reservoir depths ranging from 4,400 feet to 5,000
feet.
During 2000, the Company expended $341 million on Canadian exploration
and development activities and drilled 21 development wells and 14 exploratory
wells primarily in the Chinchaga and Martin Creek areas, of which 17 development
wells and 12 exploratory wells were successful. Effective October 1, 2000, the
Company increased its interest to 100 percent in its Chinchaga gas field in
northeast British Columbia by acquiring the remaining 13 percent working
interest. The Company added production of 475 BOE per day from this acquisition
and plans to drill as many as 70 extension and infill drilling locations over
the next three years. The Company, as operator, plans to drill approximately 19
development wells and 26 exploratory wells in Canada during 2001. The Company
expects to participate in an additional seven wells operated by other companies
in the same areas. The Company plans to spend $35 million on oil and gas
development and exploration opportunities in Canada during 2001.
Africa. The Company has entered into agreements to explore in South
Africa and Gabon. The South African agreements cover over 13 million acres along
the southern coast of South Africa, generally in water depths less than 650
feet. During 2000, the Company expended $157 million of exploration drilling
and seismic capital in South Africa and Gabon. The Company drilled three
exploratory wells in South Africa during 2000, of which one was unsuccessful and
two were in progress as of December 31, 2000. During 1999, the Company performed
15 and analyzed seismic studies necessary for the analysis, ranking and timing of
prospects in South Africa and Gabon. During 1998, five wells were drilled by the
Company in South Africa, of which two discovered reserves.
During January 2001, the Company announced a discovery on the E-DQ1
Boomslang prospect, encountering over 100 feet of net pay, consisting of an
oil leg under a gas column at a depth of 6,600 feet. The Company test of a
portion of the oil leg interval flowed at rates up to 3,120 Bbls of oil per day
and 26 MMcf of gas per day over a 48-hour period. The Company is also testing
the overlying gas column which, over a five day period, was flowing at a
constant rate of approximately 24 MMcf per day and 300 Bbls of condensate per
day. An appraisal well is also planned on the Boomslang prospect during 2001.
The Company has budgeted capital to begin development of the Sable oil field in
South Africa during 2001 with first production expected in late 2002 or early
2003. In Gabon, the Company plans to spud an exploratory well on its Olowi Block
during the second quarter of 2001. During 2001, the Company plans to spend
approximately $28 million on exploration and development opportunities in South
Africa and Gabon.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
2000 Performance
The year ended December 31, 2000 was a highly successful transition year
for Pioneer Natural Resources Company the Company, as compared to the
disciplined reorganization years of 1999 and 1998. During 2000, the Company
leveraged a highly favorable commodity price environment and the financial
flexibility gained from the austerity measures implemented during 1999 and 1998
to significantly increase net income, operating cash flows, invested capital and
proved reserves, while continuing to decrease its outstanding indebtedness and
repurchase common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded net income
of $1522 million $153 per share, as compared to net losses of $225 million
$22 per share and $7464 million $746 per share during the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Compared to 1999, the Company 2000
total revenues increased by $2026 million, or 29 percent, including a $2081
million, or 32 percent, increase in oil and gas revenues. The increase in oil
and gas revenues was due to commodity price increases, partially offset by a
decline in production volumes due to asset divestitures completed during 2000
and 1999. During 2000, the Company continued cost management measures that were
implemented during 1999 and 1998. Compared to 1999, the Company 2000 total
costs and expenses increased by $210 million, or three percent. The modest
increase in total costs and expenses included a $326 million increase in other
costs and expenses, primarily comprised of an increase in mark-to-market
provisions recognized on non-hedge derivative financial instruments. Total costs
and expenses also included increases in production taxes and field fuel expenses
that are sensitive to oil and gas commodity prices.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company grew net cash
provided by operating activities to $4301 million, representing a 69 percent
increase over 1999 net cash provided by operating activities of $2552 million,
and a 37 percent increase over 1998 net cash provided by operating activities of
$3141 million. During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company
limited its investments in oil and gas properties to approximately 70 percent of
net cash provided by operating activities, as compared to 1998 investments in
oil and gas properties which amounted to 162 percent of net cash provided by
operating activities. The disciplined investment of net cash provided by
operating  activities,  together with proceeds from the  divestiture  of
non-strategic assets of $1027 million and $3905 million during 2000 and 1999,
respectively, have allowed the Company to reduce its outstanding indebtedness by
$5965 million during the two years ended December 31, 2000. Additionally, the
Company extended the maturity of its portfolio of indebtedness during 2000 and
increased its liquidity through the issuance of $425 million of 9-5/8% Senior
Notes due April 1, 2010 the 9-5/8% Senior Notes and the replacement of the
Company prior credit facility due August 7, 2002 the Prior Credit Facility
with a new $575 million credit agreement due March 1, 2005 the Credit
Agreement.
During 2000, the Company increased its proved reserves to 628 MMBOE,
reflecting the effects of strategic acquisitions of properties in the Company
core operating areas and a successful drilling program which resulted in the
replacement of 167 percent of the Company production at a finding, development
and acquisition cost of $466 per BOE.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company also used a portion
of its net cash provided by operating activities to repurchase 23 million
shares of the Company common stock for $273 million. To the extent that cash
flow generated from operations exceeds capital expenditures, the Company may
continue to make periodic common stock repurchases.
During 2000, the Company expended $672 million to acquire proved and
unproved oil and gas properties. Strategic acquisitions of proved properties
included purchasing a 33 percent working interest in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico Camden Hills discovery, a four percent incremental working interest in
the Company deepwater Gulf of Mexico Devils Tower discovery and the remaining
13 percent working interest in the Canadian Chinchaga field. Unproved property
acquisitions were concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico, East Texas and North
Louisiana.
21    The Company also expended $2325 million of drilling and seismic capital
during 2000, representing a 64 percent increase over similar expenditures during
1999. The 2000 drilling capital was expended to drill 296 gross wells 2135 net
wells, of which 265 gross wells 1881 net wells are productive, representing
a 90 percent success rate. See Item 2. Properties for additional information
regarding the Company  reserve  replacement,  finding  costs,  property
descriptions and drilling activities.
The Company 2000 exploratory drilling was focused in the United States
Gulf of Mexico, Argentina, Canada and South Africa. The Company drilled 83 gross
exploratory wells 712 net wells during 2000, of which 61 gross exploratory
wells 522 net wells successfully discovered proved oil, NGL and gas reserves,
representing a 73 percent success rate. In the United States, the Company
expended $1199 million of drilling and seismic capital during 2000 to
successfully complete 11 exploratory wells and 159 development wells, to drill
three exploratory and three development dry holes and to begin drilling nine
exploratory and 48 development wells that remain in progress as of December 31,
2000. In Argentina, the Company expended $628 million of drilling and seismic
capital during 2000 to successfully complete 38 exploratory and 28 development
wells, to drill 16 exploratory and two development dry holes and to begin
drilling one exploratory and one development well that remain in progress as of
December 31, 2000. In Canada, the Company expended $341 million of drilling and
seismic capital during 2000 to successfully complete 12 exploratory and 17
development wells, to drill two exploratory and four development dry holes and
to begin drilling five exploratory and three development wells that remain in
progress as of December 31, 2000. In Africa, the Company expended $157 million
of drilling and seismic capital to evaluate drilling prospects in Gabon and to
drill one South African exploratory dry hole and two South African exploratory
wells that remain in progress as of December 31, 2000.
See Results of Operations, below, for more in-depth discussions of the
Company oil and gas producing activities, including discussions pertaining to
oil and gas production volumes, prices, hedging activities, costs and expenses,
capital commitments, capital resources and liquidity.
2001 Outlook
Commodity prices. The Company results of operations and financial
condition in 2001 are expected to continue to be positively affected by
favorable commodity prices as a result of decreases in worldwide oil and North
American gas supplies relative to demand for those commodities. Significant
factors affecting commodity price outlooks have included the tightening of oil
export quotas during 2000 and 1999 by members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations and the overall North
American gas supply and demand fundamentals. Although the favorable commodity
price environment presently impacting the oil and gas industry is expected to
continue during 2001, the Company will continue its debt reduction and cost
management measures to protect its net asset values from a return to a less
favorable commodity price environment.
The Company will also continue to monitor the commodity derivatives
market and, from time to time, utilize oil and gas swap and collar contracts to
reduce the risks of commodity price volatility. Through February 20, 2001, the
Company increased its average daily 2001 oil production hedged with swap
contracts to 10,597 Bbls with an average floor price of $2894 per Bbl, and
increased its average daily 2001 gas production hedged with swap contracts to
101,679 Mcf with an average floor price of $476 per MMBtu. Through February 20,
2001, the Company also entered into swap and collar contracts to hedge 64,973
Mcf per day of 2002 gas production with an average floor price of $463 per
MMBtu and, on 20,000 Mcf per day, an average ceiling price of $600 per MMBtu.
See Accounting for derivatives below for a description of the Company future
hedge accounting procedures.
First quarter 2001. Based on current estimates, the Company expects that
its first quarter worldwide production will average 112,000 to 114,000 BOE per
day. First quarter production costs are expected to rise to $570 to $615 per
BOE, primarily as a result of higher production taxes and field fuel expenses
that are directly related to higher commodity prices. Depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense is expected to average $490 to $510 per BOE during
the first quarter of 2001, and total exploration and abandonment expense is
expected to be $15 million to $30 million. General and administrative expense is
expected to be $9 million to $10 million during the first quarter of 2001.
Interest expense is expected to be $38 million to $39 million during the first
quarter of 2001, including $3 million of non-cash interest. The Company
effective income tax rate is expected to be two percent or less of income before
income taxes.
22    Production outlook. The Company expects that its annual 2001 worldwide
production will be approximately 44 to 45 MMBOE. Worldwide production in 2002
and 2003 is expected to increase as production commences from the Company
deepwater Gulf of Mexico Canyon Express gas and Devils Tower oil projects and
the Sable oil project in South Africa. Annual production is expected to be
approximately  48 to 52 MMBOE during 2002 and to further  increase to
approximately 56 to 60 MMBOE during 2003.
Capital expenditures. During 2001, the Company plans to increase capital
expended for oil and gas property additions to approximately $430 million, of
which approximately $115 million, or 27 percent, has been budgeted for
exploration expenditures and $315 million, or 73 percent, has been budgeted for
development drilling and facility costs. The Company 2001 capital budget
allocates approximately 65 percent of capital to the United States, 20 percent
to Argentina, eight percent to Canada and seven percent to Africa. The Company
2001 capital budget for the United States includes $66 million of development
capital for the Canyon Express and Devils Tower deepwater Gulf of Mexico
projects. During 2001, the Company has planned exploration drilling in the Gulf
of Mexico, the onshore Gulf Coast area, Argentina, Canada, Gabon and South
Africa. The Company has budgeted exploratory drilling and seismic expenditures
of approximately $55 million for the United States areas and $45 million for
international areas during 2001. The Company will continue to use the excess of
cash provided by operating activities over capital expenditures for oil and gas
producing activities to reduce outstanding indebtedness, acquire additional
interests in core properties and/or repurchase common stock.
Accounting for derivatives. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, the provisions
of which the Company will adopt effective January 1, 2001.
SFAS 133 requires the  accounting  recognition  of all derivative
instruments as either assets or  liabilities at fair value.  Derivative
instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net
income loss. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in
the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, through
net income loss. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are
cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income loss until such
time as the hedged items are recognized in net income loss. Ineffective
portions of a derivative instrument change in fair value are immediately
recognized in net income loss.
The adoption of SFAS 133 will result in a January 1, 2001 transition
adjustment to i record the fair value of the Company derivative instruments
that qualify for hedge accounting, and ii reclassify deferred hedge losses
within the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet. Beginning with the first
quarter of 2001, and quarterly thereafter, the Company will quantify changes in
the fair values of its derivative instruments and will account for those changes
in accordance with SFAS 133, as described above.
The January 1, 2001 transition adjustment will reduce the carrying value
of the Company total assets by $446 million and will increase the carrying
value of the Company liabilities by $1533 million. As a result, stockholders'
equity will be reduced on January 1, 2001 by $1979 million. See Notes B and H
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the
provisions of SFAS 133 and the components of the Company January 1, 2001
transition adjustment.
Due to the settlement of maturing derivative contracts and reductions in
gas prices, it is expected that the SFAS 133 impact to the Company
stockholders' equity as of March 31, 2001 will be significantly lower than the
initial transition  adjustment of $1979 million,  which was based upon
market-quoted prices as of January 1, 2001. From January 1, 2001 through
February 20, 2001, the average NYMEX swap price for unexpired 2001 oil contracts
increased by $231 per Bbl, or nine percent, and the average NYMEX swap price
for unexpired 2001 gas contracts decreased by $121 per MMBtu, or 19 percent. In
general, the provisions of SFAS 133 will increase the volatility of the
Company reported consolidated assets, liabilities, stockholders' equity, net
income loss and comprehensive income loss.
Results of Operations
Oil and gas revenues. Revenues from oil and gas operations totaled $8527
million during 2000, as compared to $6446 million during 1999 and $7115
million during 1998, representing a 32 percent increase from 1999 to 2000 and a
23 nine percent decrease from 1998 to 1999. The revenue increase from 1999 to 2000
is reflective of year-to-year increases in average reported commodity prices,
including the effects of commodity hedges, of 56 percent, 74 percent and 48
percent for oil, NGL and gas, respectively, partially offset by a 15 percent
decrease in BOE production. The decline in production was primarily attributable
to asset divestitures and normal well production declines. Excluding the
production associated with assets divested during 2000 and 1999, BOE production
declined by approximately one percent during 2000 as compared to 1999. The
revenue decrease from 1998 to 1999 is reflective of a 19 percent decrease in BOE
production, partially offset by price increases of 17 percent, 31 percent and
four percent for oil, NGL and gas, respectively. The decline in production was
primarily attributable to asset divestitures, but also reflects the deferral of
oil well completions at the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999 until oil
prices recovered, in addition to normal well production declines. Excluding the
production associated with 1999 and 1998 asset divestitures, production declined
by nine percent during the year ended December 31, 1999, as compared to the same
period in 1998.

The oil and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market
price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the Company
hedging activities. The Company utilizes commodity derivative contracts swaps
and collars in order to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the
commodities the Company produces and sells, ii support the Company annual
capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce price risk associated
with certain capital projects. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
information concerning the Company open hedge positions at December 31, 2000
and their related prices.
24    Interest and other revenue. The Company recorded interest and other
income totaling $258 million, $897 million and $105 during 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The decrease in interest and other income during 2000, and
the significant increase during 1999, were primarily  attributable to a
non-recurring excise tax refund of $302 million and a non-recurring option fee
of $418 million recognized by the Company during 1999. See Note J of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information.
Gain loss on disposition of assets. During 2000, the Company completed
the divestiture of certain assets for proceeds of $1027 million. Associated
therewith, the Company recorded a net gain on disposition of assets of $342
million during 2000. The 2000 divestitures included the sale of common stock of
a non-affiliated entity for net proceeds of $597 million, from which the
Company recognized a gain on disposition of assets of $343 million. The Company
also sold certain oil and gas producing properties and other assets during 2000
for proceeds of $430 million, from which the Company recognized a loss on
disposition of assets of $1 million.
During 1998, the Company announced measures to increase its financial
flexibility and to safeguard net asset values. Those measures included the
enhancement of core assets and the divestiture of non-core assets. During 1999,
the Company completed the asset divestiture phase of the measures. As a result,
the Company realized net divestment proceeds from asset divestitures of $4205
million during 1999 and recorded an associated net loss on disposition of assets
of $242 million.
The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2000 and 1999 were
used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for additional information regarding asset divestitures.
Production costs. Total production costs per BOE increased in 2000 by
approximately 39 percent and decreased in 1999 by approximately 12 percent.
Lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of
production costs over which the Company has management control, while production
taxes, ad valorem taxes and field fuel expenses are directly related to
commodity price changes. During 2000, as compared to 1999, per BOE lease
operating expenses and workover expenses increased on a combined basis by 16
percent while per BOE production taxes, ad valorem taxes and field fuel expenses
increased on a combined basis by 95 percent. The increase in 2000 is primarily
due to significant increases in those expenses that are directly related to
commodity price levels and, to a lesser extent, inflation in field service
expenses. During 1999, as compared to 1998, per BOE lease operating expenses and
workover expenses decreased on a combined basis by 15 percent and per BOE
production taxes, ad valorem taxes and field fuel expenses decreased by 6
percent. The operating margins from the Company gas plants i.e., third party
processing revenues less processing costs and expenses are included in lease
operating expenses, which resulted in decreases in lease operating expenses per
BOE during 2000 and 1999 of $34 and $11, respectively, and an increase in
lease operating expenses per BOE of $05 during 1998.

Depletion expense. Depletion expense per BOE increased seven percent
during 2000 to $457 from $427 in 1999 and decreased 17 percent in 1999 from
$513 in 1998. The increase in per BOE depletion expense during 2000 is
primarily due to an increase in the Company Argentine and Canadian proved
property basis as a result of reclassifying unproved property basis associated
with the Company exploration and extension drilling success to proved property
and to a higher proportionate share of the Company production being produced
from Argentina. The decrease in 1999 depletion expense per BOE was primarily
attributable to the positive impact on proved reserves from improved community
25 prices and to the impairment of the carrying values of the Company proved oil
and gas properties during the year ended December 31, 1998.
Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its oil and gas
producing properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate a
decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of the Company assets may
have occurred. Declining commodity prices in 1998, the Company outlook for
future commodity prices and 1998 performance issues relative to certain oil and
gas properties, prompted impairment reviews. As a result of these reviews, the
Company recognized a non-cash charge of $3122 million in 1998, related to its
proved oil and gas properties.
The Company periodically assesses its unproved properties to determine
whether they have been impaired. An unproved property may be impaired if the
Company does not intend to drill the prospect as a result of downward revisions
to potential reserves, if the results of exploration or the Company outlook
for future commodity prices indicate that the potential reserves are not
sufficient to generate net cash flows to recover the investment required by the
project, or if the Company intends to sell the property for less than its
carrying value. The Company has assessed its unproved oil and gas properties for
impairment and, during the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, recognized
non-cash impairment charges of $179 million and $1473 million, respectively,
to reduce the carrying value of its unproved oil and gas properties.
Exploration  and  abandonments/geological  and  geophysical  costs.
Exploration and abandonments/geological and geophysical costs totaled $876
million, $660 million and $1219 million for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of

The increase in 2000 exploration costs, as compared to 1999, is primarily
due to increased geological and geophysical costs that are supportive of future
exploratory  drilling,  unproved  leasehold  abandonments  associated with
exploratory dry holes in Argentina and dry hole costs  associated with
exploratory drilling in South Africa. The decrease in 1999 exploratory costs is
primarily attributable to the Company curtailed 1999 capital program, as
evidenced by reductions in all categories of exploration,  abandonments,
geological and geophysical costs as compared to 1998. Approximately 36 percent
of the Company 2000 exploration capital was spent on exploratory projects as
compared to 31 percent in 1999 and 30 percent in 1998.
Interest and administrative  expenses.  Interest and general and
administrative expenses were $1620 million and $333 million, respectively,
during 2000, as compared to $1703 million and $402 million, respectively,
during 1999, and $1643 million and $730 million, respectively, during 1998. On
a per BOE basis, interest and general and administrative expenses were $372 and
$76, respectively, during 2000, as compared to $333 and $79, respectively,
during 1999, and $261 and $116, respectively, during 1998. Interest expense
decreased during 2000, as compared to 1999, primarily due to a decrease in the
Company weighted average debt outstanding for the year. This decline was
26 offset, to a certain extent, by higher interest rates in 2000 as compared to
1999. The increase in interest expense during 1999, as compared to 1998, was due
to the higher weighted average debt balances in 1999. The significant declines
in administrative expense during 2000 and 1999, and the decline in interest
expense during 2000, were a direct result of the financial measures taken by the
Company to manage costs and reduce outstanding indebtedness. On a per BOE basis,
interest expense increased in 2000 and 1999, primarily due to higher interest
rates and production declines as a result of asset divestitures. The decline in
per BOE administrative expense is due to the reorganization measures initiated
by the Company during 1998. Those reorganization  measures included the
centralization in Irving, Texas of certain operational and administrative
functions previously based in Midland, Texas; the closings of the Company
regional offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Corpus Christi, Texas, and Houston,
Texas; workforce reductions; and, other initiatives. As a direct result of those
measures, the Company recognized reorganization charges of $85 million and
$332 million during 1999 and 1998, respectively see Note M of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for specific information regarding reorganization costs paid
during 2000, 1999 and 1998, and unpaid reorganization costs as of December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998.
Other expenses. Other expenses were $672 million during 2000, as
compared to $347 million during 1999 and $396 million during 1998. The
increase in other expenses during 2000, as compared to 1999 and 1998, is
primarily attributable to increases in mark-to-market provisions on non-hedge
derivative financial instruments. Such mark-to- market provisions during 2000
included $420 million associated with non-hedge commodity derivatives that
matured in December 2000, $146 million associated with the Company non-hedge
Btu swap agreements and $19 million associated with a series of non-hedge
forward foreign exchange swap agreements that matured in December 2000.
Mark-to-market provisions in 1999 included $212 million associated with
non-hedge commodity derivatives and $119 million associated with an investment
in the common stock of a non-affiliated, public entity, partially offset by $59
million of mark-to-market income recognized on a series of forward foreign
exchange swap agreements and income of $2 million associated with the Company
Btu swap agreements.  Other expense for 1998 included $205 million of
mark-to-market  adjustments of non-hedge  foreign  currency and Btu swap
agreements, a $96 million write-off of deferred compensation arising from
change of control features in the Company incentive plans, $44 million of
other expenses associated with the Company operations in Argentina and Canada,
and $23 million of bad debt expense. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk and Notes C and H of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data for specific disclosures pertaining to the Company investments in
derivative financial instruments.
Income tax provisions benefits. The Company recognized consolidated
income tax benefits of $60 million and $6 million during 2000 and 1999,
respectively, and an income tax provision of $156 million during 1998. The tax
benefit in 2000 is comprised of a $106 million deferred tax benefit in
Argentina, partially offset by $46 million of current taxes paid in Argentina.
Due to uncertainties regarding the Company ability to realize net operating
loss carryovers and tax credit carryovers prior to their scheduled expirations,
the Company did not recognize deferred income tax benefits associated with its
operating results for 1999 and 1998. Additionally, during 1998, the Company
net loss was impacted by a $2711 million valuation allowance recognized to
reduce the carrying value of the Company deferred tax assets. Although
realization is not assured for the Company remaining deferred tax assets, the
Company believes it is more likely than not that they will be realized through
future taxable earnings or alternative tax planning strategies. However, the net
deferred tax assets could be reduced further if the Company estimate of
taxable income in future periods is significantly reduced or alternative tax
planning strategies are no longer viable. As a result of this situation, it is
likely that the Company effective tax rate in 2001 will be minimal. If the
Company recognizes income before income taxes in 2001, its effective tax rate
will be reduced to the extent that taxable earnings are recognized in those tax
jurisdictions relative to which the Company has established its valuation
allowance. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding
the Company income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation reserves.
Extraordinary item. During 2000, the Company replaced its Prior Credit
Facility that was scheduled to mature August 7, 2002, with the Credit Agreement
that matures March 1, 2005. Associated therewith, the Company recognized a $123
million extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt.
27 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital commitments. The Company primary needs for cash are for
exploration, development and acquisitions of oil and gas properties, repayment
of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and working capital
obligations.
The Company cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties
during 2000, 1999 and 1998 totaled $2997 million, $1797 million and $5073
million, respectively. The $1200 million, or 67 percent, increase in 2000
capital expenditures as compared to the expenditures of 1999 was a result of the
$1749 million, or 69 percent, increase in net cash provided by operating
activities during 2000 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities
during 1999. During 1999, as compared to 1998, the Company significantly
decreased its capital expenditures in support of debt reduction and financial
management initiatives.
The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at moderate levels in
order to provide  sufficient  financial  flexibility to react to future
opportunities. Therefore, during both 2000 and 1999, the Company limited its
capital expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties to 70 percent of
net cash provided by operating activities in order to further reduce its
outstanding indebtedness. The Company expects that cash provided by operating
activities during 2001 will exceed its 2001 capital expenditure budget of $430
million. To the extent that cash provided by operating activities exceeds
capital expenditures during 2001, the Company intends to further reduce its
outstanding debt, acquire additional  interest in core properties and/or
repurchase common stock. The Company budgets its capital expenditures based on
projected internally-generated cash flows and may adjust the level of its
capital expenditures in response to anticipated changes in cash flows or other
factors, at the Company discretion.
Funding for the Company working capital obligations is also provided by
internally-generated cash flow. Funding for the repayment of principal and
interest on outstanding debt and the Company capital expenditure program may
be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, proceeds from
the disposition of non-strategic assets or alternative financing sources as
discussed in Capital Resources below.
Capital resources. The Company primary capital resources are net cash
provided by operating activities, proceeds from financing activities and
proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets. The Company expects that these
resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments and allow further
debt reductions in 2001.
Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during
2000, 1999 and 1998 were $4301 million, $2552 million and $3141 million,
respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities during 2000 increased 69
percent from that of 1999 primarily as a result of favorable commodity prices
and cost management measures. Net cash provided by operating activities during
1999 decreased 19 percent from that of 1998 primarily as a result of declines in
production volumes due to oil and gas property divestitures, partially offset by
increases in commodity prices and decreases in production and administrative
costs. Net cash provided by operating activities during 1999, as compared to
that of 1998, also declined as a result of increases in working capital
associated with operating activities.
Financing activities. On May 31, 2000, the Company entered into the
Credit Agreement with a syndication of banks the Banks that matures on March
1, 2005. Outstanding borrowings under the $575 million Credit Agreement totaled
$2250 million as of December 31, 2000. The Credit Agreement replaced the
Company Prior Credit Facility that had a maturity date of August 7, 2002.
During April 2000, the Company issued the 9-5/8% Senior Notes at a
discount of 353 percent, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after
underwriting discounts, commissions and costs of issuance, of $4154 million.
The net proceeds from the issuance of the 9-5/8% Senior Notes were used to
reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company Prior Credit Facility. The
9-5/8%  Senior Notes contain  various  restrictive  covenants,  including
restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and certain payments
defined within the associated indenture.
At December 31, 2000, the Company has four other outstanding senior debt
issuances. Such debt issuances consist of i $150 million aggregate principal
amount of 8-7/8% senior notes due in 2005; ii $150 million aggregate principal
amount of 8-1/4% senior notes due in 2007; iii $350 million aggregate
principal amount of 6-1/2% senior notes due in 2008; and, iv $250 million
aggregate principal amount of 7-1/5% senior notes due in 2028.
28    The weighted average interest rate on the Company indebtedness for the
year ended December 31, 2000 was 868 percent as compared to 781 percent for
the year ended December 31, 1999 and 716 percent for the year ended December
31, 1998, taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps. See Note D of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for more specific information regarding the
Company long-term debt as of December 31, 2000 and 1999.
As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing
sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities,
preferred stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in
exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and
gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class
preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and
liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined
by the Company Board of Directors.
Sales of non-strategic assets. During 2000, 1999 and 1998, proceeds from
the sale of non-strategic assets totaled $1027 million, $4205 million
including $30 million of non-cash proceeds and $219 million, respectively.
The Company 2000 and 1999 asset divestitures were comprised of non-strategic
United States and Canadian oil and gas properties, gas plants and other assets.
The net cash proceeds from the 2000 and 1999 asset divestitures were used to
reduce the Company outstanding indebtedness see Results of Operations,
above, and Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The proceeds from the
1998 asset divestitures were primarily utilized to provide funding for a portion
of the Company capital expenditures during 1998.
Book capitalization and liquidity. Total debt was reduced to $16 billion
as of December 31, 2000, as compared to total debt of $17 billion and $22
billion on December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company total book
capitalization at December 31, 2000 was $25 billion, consisting of total debt
of $16 billion and stockholders' equity of $9 billion. Consequently, the
Company debt to total capitalization decreased to 64 percent at December 31,
2000 from 69 percent at December 31, 1999. At December 31, 2000, the Company had
$262 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, compared to $348 million at
December 31, 1999. The Company ratio of current assets to current liabilities
was 88 at December 31, 2000 and 93 at December 31, 1999.
ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about
financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from
changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or
common and preferred stock prices. Although certain derivative contracts that
the Company is a party to do not qualify as hedges, the Company does not enter
into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes.
Quantitative Disclosures
Interest rate sensitivity. The following tables provide information, in
United States dollar equivalent amounts,  about the Company derivative
financial instruments and other financial instruments to which the Company was a
party as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, which are sensitive to changes in
interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected
maturity dates together with the weighted average interest rates expected to be
paid on the debt, given current contractual terms and market conditions. For
fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual
fixed rates that the Company is obligated to periodically pay on the debt; for
variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates being
paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for
United States treasury securities.
The accompanying table as of December 31, 2000 also provides information
about interest rate swap agreements entered into by the Company during 2000. The
interest rate swap agreements hedge the fair value of the Company 8-7/8%
Senior Notes due April 15, 2005.

financial instruments that the Company was a party to as of December 31, 2000
and 1999 and that are sensitive to changes in oil and gas commodity prices. The
tables segregate hedge derivative contracts from those that do not qualify as
hedges.
Commodity hedge instruments. The Company currently hedges commodity price
risk with swap and collar contracts. As of December 31, 1999, the Company hedged
commodity price risk with swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts
with short put options. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional
amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide a floor price for the Company
on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing some additional price
participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. Collar
contracts with short put options differ from other collar contracts by virtue of
the short put option price below which the Company realized price will exceed
variable market prices by the long put-to-short put price differential.
Commodity non-hedge instruments. The Company has entered into Btu swap
contracts and, during 1999 through their maturity in 2000, optional call
contracts. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. Under the terms
of the Btu swap contracts, the Company receives 10 percent of the NYMEX oil
price and pays the NYMEX gas price on a notional 13,036 MMBtu daily gas volume.
During 2000, the Company terminated its variable position in the Btu swap
contracts for the 2001 volumes, but continues to participate for 2002 through
2004 volumes.  The terms of the optional call  contracts  provided the
counterparties with the option to call either notional oil volumes or gas
volumes at specific index prices. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are
presented in both the accompanying oil and gas tables.
See Notes B, C and H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a
description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to
hedge and non-hedge  derivative  financial  instruments and for specific
information  regarding the terms of the Company  derivative  financial
instruments that are sensitive to changes in gas and oil commodity prices.

of its gas hedges to connect the index price of the hedging instrument from
a NYMEX index to an index which reflects the geographic area of production.
The Company considers these basis swaps as part of the associated swap and
option contracts and, accordingly, the effects of the basis swaps have been

- 1 To minimize basis risk, the Company enters into basis swaps for a portion
of its gas hedges to connect the index price of the hedging instrument from
a NYMEX index to an index which reflects the geographic area of production.
The Company considers these basis swaps as part of the associated swap and
option contracts and, accordingly, the effects of the basis swaps have been
presented together with the associated contracts.
2 As of December 31, 1999, certain counterparties to the swap contracts had
the contractual right to sell year 2001, 2002 and 2003 swap contracts to
the Company for notional daily contract volumes of 49,223, 12,500 and
10,000 MMBtu per day, respectively, at prices of $225, $252 and $258 per
MMBtu, respectively. During 2000, the Company liquidated these contracts,
recognizing associated deferred hedge losses, and entered into a year 2001
swap contract for notional daily contract volumes of 49,223 MMBtu at a
weighted average strike price of $225 per MMBtu. See Note H of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.
3 As of December 31, 1999, 54,582 MMBtu per day of year 2000 collar option
contracts  with short puts were  extendable  at the option of the
counterparties for a period of one year at average per MMBtu prices of
$271, $209 and $180 for the short call, long put and short put,
respectively. As of December 31, 1999, 60,000 MMBtu per day of the year
2001 collar option contracts with short puts were extendable at the option
of the counterparties at average per MMBtu prices of $264, $225 and $195
for the short call, long put and short put, respectively. During 2000, the
Company liquidated these contracts, recognizing associated deferred hedge
losses, and entered into a year 2001 collar contract for 54,582 MMBtu per
day at weighted average per MMBtu prices of $273 for the short call
ceiling price and $211 for the long put floor price. See Note H of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

and gas market prices, they are duplicated in the Oil Price Sensitivity and
the Natural Gas Price Sensitivity tables.
5 The average forward NYMEX oil and gas prices are based on February 2, 2000
market quotes.
35    Other price sensitivity. On December 31, 1999, the Company owned
2,376923 shares of Prize Energy Corp. Prize six percent convertible
preferred stock Prize Preferred having an original liquidation preference of
$300 million. Prior to 2000, Prize was a closely held, non-public entity and
the fair market value of the Prize Preferred was not readily determinable.
During 2000, the common stock of Prize began to publicly trade on the American
Stock Exchange and the Company Prize Preferred shares were exchanged for
3,984,197 shares of Prize common stock Prize Common. During 2000, the
Company sold 3,370,982 shares of Prize Common and received cash in lieu of
33,964 shares of preferred in-kind dividends for a combined total of $597
million. The fair market value of the Company remaining investment in 613,215
shares of Prize Common was $127 million as of December 31, 2000.
Qualitative Disclosures
Non-derivative financial instruments. The Company is a borrower under
fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate
risk. The Company objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is
to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing the Company costs of capital.
To realize its objectives, the Company borrows under fixed and variable rate
debt instruments, based on the availability of capital, market conditions and
hedge opportunities. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a
discussion relative to the Company debt instruments.
As described in Other price sensitivity above, the Company owns 613,215
shares of Prize Common. The Company does not routinely acquire shares of common
stock of publicly traded entities for investment purposes. The Prize Common was
received by the Company in partial consideration for assets acquired from the
Company by Prize.
Derivative financial instruments. The Company has entered into interest
rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price derivative contracts to hedge
interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks. Although the
Company is a party to certain derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment and has entered into other derivative contracts in the past
that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the Company policy is to
limit its participation in derivative contracts to those that, in the opinion of
management, reduce the Company overall economic risk.
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company was a party to the Btu swap
contracts and as of December 31, 1999, it was also a party to the Canadian
denominated foreign exchange rate swap and optional commodity calls that are
described more fully in Quantitative Disclosures, above, and Note H of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. These financial instruments do not qualify as hedges of
commodity price or foreign exchange rate risk under generally  accepted
accounting standards.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company primary risk exposures associated
with financial instruments to which it is a party include oil and gas price
volatility and interest rate volatility. The Company primary risk exposures
associated with financial instruments have not changed significantly since
December 31, 2000.

Pioneer Natural Resources Company    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pioneer
Natural Resources Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended  December 31, 2000.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.                            Ernst & Young LLP Dallas, Texas

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 NOTE A.   Organization and Nature of Operations
Pioneer Natural  Resources  Company the Company is a Delaware
corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Company was formed by the merger of
Parker & Parsley Petroleum Company Parker & Parsley and MESA Inc. Mesa
in August 1997. The Company is an oil and gas exploration and production company
with ownership interests in oil and gas properties located principally in the
Mid Continent, Southwestern and onshore and offshore Gulf Coast regions of the
United States and in Argentina, Canada and South Africa.
NOTE B.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation.  The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries since
their acquisition or formation, and the Company interest in the affiliated oil
and gas partnerships for which it serves as general partner through certain of
its wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  Investments in less than  majority-owned
subsidiaries where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence
over the investee operations are accounted for by the equity method. The
Company proportionately consolidates less than 100 percent-owned oil and gas
partnerships in accordance with industry practice. The Company owns less than a
20 percent interest in the oil and gas partnerships that it proportionately
consolidates. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.
Investments in non-affiliated equity securities that have a readily
determinable fair value are classified as trading securities if management
current intent is to hold them for only a short period of time; otherwise, they
are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The Company re-evaluates
the classification of investments in non-affiliated equity securities at each
balance  sheet  date.  The  carrying  value of trading  securities  and
available-for-sale securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance
sheet date. Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities in
interest and other revenue, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in
other expense during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for available-for-sale
securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other comprehensive
income loss during the periods in which changes in fair value occur. The
Company did not have any investments in available-for-sale securities during the
years ended December 31, 1999 or 1998.
Investments in non-affiliated equity securities that do not have a
readily determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost
or the net realizable value of the investment.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements. Preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and
depository accounts held by banks.
Inventories. Inventories consist of lease and well equipment which are
carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in first-out basis.
Oil and gas properties. The Company utilizes the successful efforts
method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, all
costs associated with productive wells and nonproductive development wells are
capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological and geophysical
43             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 expenditures are expensed. The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures for
significant development projects until such projects are ready for their
intended use.
The Company accounts for its natural gas processing facilities activities
as part of its oil and gas properties for financial reporting purposes. All
revenues and expenses derived from third party gas volumes processed through the
Company natural gas processing facilities have been reported as components of
oil and gas production costs. The capitalized costs of natural gas processing
facilities are included in proved oil and gas properties and are depleted using
the unit-of-production method.
Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on proved reserves as determined by the
Company engineers. Costs of significant nonproducing properties, wells in the
process of being drilled and development projects are excluded from depletion
until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are
established or impairment is determined.
Generally, capitalized costs of individual properties sold or abandoned
are charged to accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization with the
proceeds from the sales of individual properties credited to property costs; no
gain or loss is recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However,
gain or loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire amortization
base if the disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion
rate of the remaining properties in the amortization base.
If significant, the Company accrues the estimated future costs to plug
and abandon wells under the unit-of- production method. The charge, if any, is
reflected in the accompanying  Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income Loss as abandonment expense while the liability is
reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other liabilities.
Plugging and abandonment liabilities assumed in a business combination accounted
for as a purchase are recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the
Company has recognized plugging and abandonment liabilities of $420 million and
$442 million, respectively.
The Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including
proved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method
of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value
of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is indicated if the
sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the
assets. In this circumstance, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair
value of the asset.
Unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are
periodically assessed for impairment by comparing their cost to their estimated
value on a project-by-project basis. The estimated value is affected by the
results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future
sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of
potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully
recover the cost invested in each project, the Company will recognize an
impairment loss at that time by recording an allowance. The remaining unproved
oil and gas properties are aggregated and an overall impairment allowance is
provided based on the Company historical experience.
Treasury stock. Treasury stock purchases are recorded at cost. Upon
reissuance, the cost of treasury shares held is reduced by the average purchase
price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.
Environmental. The Company environmental expenditures are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate
to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future
economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property or  mitigate or  prevent future environmental contamination are
44             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessment and/or
remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such
liabilities are undiscounted unless the timing of cash payments for the
liability are fixed or reliably determinable.
Revenue recognition.  The Company uses the entitlements method of
accounting for oil, natural gas liquids NGL and gas revenues. Sales proceeds
in excess of the Company entitlement are included in other liabilities and the
Company share of sales taken by others is included in other assets in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
entitlement liabilities totaled $190 million and $155 million, respectively,
and entitlement assets totaled $337 million and $330 million, respectively.
Stock-based compensation. The Company accounts for employee stock-based
compensation  using the intrinsic value method  prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25. The Company has reported the disclosures required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123 in Note F below.
Derivatives and hedging. Prior to January 1, 2001, the following criteria
were required to be met in order for the Company to account for a derivative
instrument as a hedge of an existing asset or liability, or of a forecasted
transaction: an asset, liability or forecasted transaction must have existed
that exposed the Company to price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk
that was not offset in another asset or liability; the derivative instrument
must have reduced that price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk; and,
the derivative instrument must have been designated as a hedge at the inception
of the instrument and throughout the hedge period. Additionally, in order to
qualify as a hedge, there must have been clear correlation between changes in
the fair value or expected cash flows of the derivative instrument and the fair
value or expected cash flows of the hedged asset or liability, or forecasted
transaction, such that changes in the derivative instrument offset the effect of
price, interest rate or foreign exchange rate changes on the exposed items.
Prior to January 1, 2001, gains or losses realized from derivative
instruments that qualified as hedges were deferred as assets or liabilities
until the underlying hedged asset, liability or transaction monetized, matured
or was otherwise recognized under generally accepted accounting principles. When
recognized in net income loss, hedge gains and losses are classified as
components of the commodity prices, interest or foreign exchange rates that the
derivative instrument hedged. Derivative instruments that are not hedges are
recorded at fair value, as assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair values of
non-hedge derivative instruments are recognized as other income or other expense
during the periods in which their fair values change. See Note H for a
description of the specific types of derivative transactions in which the
Company participates.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133 as amended, the provisions of
which the Company will adopt effective January 1, 2001.
SFAS 133 requires the  accounting  recognition  of all derivative
instruments as either assets or  liabilities at fair value.  Derivative
instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net
income loss. Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in
the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments, through
net income loss. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are
cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income loss until such
time as the hedged items are recognized in net income loss. Ineffective
portions of a derivative instrument change in fair value are immediately
recognized in net income loss.
45             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998    The adoption of SFAS 133 will result in a January 1, 2001 transition
adjustment to i reclassify $578 million of deferred losses on terminated
hedge positions from other assets including $116 million of other current
assets, ii increase other current assets, other assets and other current
liabilities by $70 million, $62 million and $1471 million, respectively, to
record the fair value of open hedge derivatives, iii increase the carrying
value of hedged long-term debt by $62 million and iv reduce stockholders'
equity by $1979 million for the net impact of items i through iii above.
The $1979 million reduction in stockholders' equity will be reflected as a
transition adjustment in other comprehensive income loss as of January 1,
2001.
Foreign currency translation. The financial statements of subsidiary
entities whose functional currency is not the United States dollar are
translated to United States dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities at
year-end exchange rates; revenues, costs and expenses at average exchange rates.
Gains and losses from translating non-United States dollar denominated balances
are recorded directly in stockholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction
gains and losses are included in net loss.
The exchange rates used in the preparation of these consolidated
financial statements appear below                                      December 31,

December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998    Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets,
accounts payable, interest payable and other current liabilities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Investments in non-affiliated entity. On December 31, 1999, the Company
owned 2,376923 shares of Prize Energy Corp. Prize six percent convertible
preferred stock Prize Preferred having an original liquidation preference of
$300 million. Prior to February 9, 2000, Prize was a closely held, non-public
entity and the fair market value of the Prize Preferred was not readily
determinable. On February 9, 2000, the common stock of Prize Prize Common
began to publicly trade on the American Stock Exchange. At that time, the
Company Prize Preferred was exchanged for 3,984,197 shares of Prize Series A
6% Convertible Preferred Stock Prize Senior A Preferred. On March 31, 2000,
the Company and Prize converted the Company 3,984,197 shares of Prize Senior A
Preferred to 3,984,197 shares of Prize Common, received cash in lieu of 33,964
shares of preferred in-kind dividends and the Company sold to Prize 1,346,482
shares of the Prize Common for a combined cash total of $186 million. During
2000, the Company sold an additional 2,024,500 shares of Prize Common in the
open market for $411 million see Note K for additional information regarding
Prize stock divestitures. The fair market value of the Company remaining
investment in 613,215 shares of Prize Common was $127 million as of December
31, 2000 and is included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
Long-term debt. The carrying amount of borrowings outstanding under the
Company line of credit see Note D approximates fair value because these
instruments bear interest at variable market rates. The fair values of each of
the senior note issuances were based on quoted market prices for each of these
issues.
It was not practicable to estimate the fair value of certain of the
long-term debt obligations because quoted market prices are not available and
the Company does not have a current borrowing rate which could be used as a
comparable rate for the stated maturities of the obligations.
Interest rate swaps, foreign currency swap contracts and commodity price
swap and collar contracts. The fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign
currency contracts and commodity price swap and collar contracts are estimated
from quotes provided by the counterparties to these instruments and represent
the estimated amounts that the Company would expect to receive or pay to
terminate the agreements. See Note H for a description of each of these
instruments, including whether the derivative contract qualifies for hedge
accounting treatment or is considered a speculative derivative instrument.

Line of credit. On May 31, 2000, the Company entered into a $5750
million credit agreement the Credit Agreement with a syndication of banks
the Banks that matures on March 1, 2005. Outstanding borrowings under the
Credit Agreement totaled $2250 million as of December 31, 2000. The Credit
Agreement replaced the Company prior revolving credit facility that had a
maturity date of August 7, 2002 the Prior Credit Facility. Outstanding
borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility totaled $8250 million as of December
31, 1999. Advances under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the option of
the Company, based on a a base rate equal to the higher of the Bank of
America, N.A. prime rate 950 percent at December 31, 2000 or a rate per annum
based on the weighted average of the rates on overnight Federal funds
transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System 650 percent at
December 31, 2000, plus 50 basis points; plus a eurodollar margin the
Eurodollar Margin less 125 basis points, b a Eurodollar rate, substantially
equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR 63987 percent at December
31, 2000, plus a Eurodollar Margin, or c a fixed rate for aggregate advances
not exceeding $50 million as quoted by the Banks pursuant to a request by the
Company. The Eurodollar Margin is based on a grid of the Company debt ratings
and ratio of total debt to earnings before gain or loss on the disposition of
assets; interest expense; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense; exploration expense and other noncash expenses the Total Leverage
Ratio. As of December 31, 2000, the Eurodollar Margin is 125 basis points. As
a result of the early extinguishment of the Prior Credit Facility, the Company
recognized an extraordinary loss of $123 million, net of taxes, during the
quarter ended June 30, 2000.
The Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictive covenants on the
Company, including the maintenance of a Total Leverage Ratio not to exceed 400
to 100 through September 30, 2002 and 375 to 100 thereafter; maintenance of
an annual ratio of the net present value of the Company oil and gas properties
to total debt of at least 125 to 100; a limitation on the Company total
debt; and, restrictions on certain payments.
Senior notes.  The Company  senior notes are general  unsecured
obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured
indebtedness of the Company and are senior in right of payment to all existing
and future subordinated indebtedness of the Company. In addition, the Company is
a holding company that conducts all of its operations through subsidiaries;
consequently, the senior notes issuances are structurally subordinated to all
obligations of its subsidiaries. Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. Pioneer
USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary, has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the
senior note issuances. See Note Q for a discussion of Pioneer USA debt
guarantees and Consolidating Financial Statements. Interest on the Company
senior notes is payable semi-annually.
During April 2000, the Company issued $4250 million of 9-5/8% Senior
Notes Due April 1, 2010 the 9-5/8% Senior Notes. The 9-5/8% Senior Notes
were issued at a discount of 353 percent and resulted in net proceeds to the
Company, after underwriting discounts, commissions and costs of issuance, of
$4154 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 9-5/8% Senior Notes
were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Company Prior Credit
Facility. The 9-5/8% Senior Notes contain various restrictive covenants,
including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and certain
payments defined within the associated indenture.
Interest expense. The following amounts have been charged to interest

NOTE E.    Related Party Transactions
Activities with affiliated partnerships.  The Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries,  has in the past sponsored certain affiliated
partnerships,  including 44 drilling  partnerships,  three public  income
partnerships and 13 affiliated employee partnerships, all of which were formed
primarily for the purpose of drilling and completing wells or acquiring
producing properties. In 1992, the Company discontinued sponsoring public and
private oil and gas development drilling partnerships, income partnerships and
affiliated employee partnerships.
In December 2000, the Company received the approval of the partners of 13
employee partnerships to merge with Pioneer USA for a purchase price of $20
million. Of the total purchase price, $317 thousand was paid to current Company
employees. Additionally, during 2000, the Company purchased all of the direct
oil and gas interests held by the Company Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer for $195 thousand.
During each of the years 1994, 1993 and 1992, the Company formed a Direct
Investment Partnership for the purpose of permitting selected key employees to
invest directly, on an unpromoted basis, in wells that the Company drills. The
partners in the Direct Investment Partnerships formed in 1994, 1993 and 1992 pay
and receive approximately 337 percent, 15375 percent and 1865 percent,
respectively, of the costs and revenues attributable to the Company interest
in the wells in which such Direct Investment Partnership participates. The
Company discontinued the formation of Direct Investment Partnerships in 1995. In
November 2000, the Company exercised its right under the Direct Investment
Partnership agreements to purchase each partner interest in their respective
Direct Investment Partnership. The Company paid $43 million to complete the
purchase, of which $887 thousand was paid to current Company employees.
The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as operator of
properties in which it and its affiliated partnerships have an interest.
Accordingly, the Company receives producing well overhead, drilling well
overhead and other fees related to the operation of the properties. The
affiliated partnerships also reimburse the Company for their allocated share of
general and administrative charges.
The activities with affiliated partnerships are summarized for the
following related party transactions for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999

the Company to accept the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of
Prize. The sale of the assets to Prize was initiated through an auction process
which, upon receipt of Prize initial offer, was placed under the supervision
of a special independent committee comprised of outside directors unrelated to
Prize of the Company Board of Directors. The independent committee reviewed
and considered all offers presented to the Company for the purchase of the
assets acquired by Prize. The Prize offer was approved by the special
independent committee as being the best offer presented see Notes C and K for
information pertaining to the Company investment in Prize and the divestiture
of assets to Prize.
Consulting fee. Effective January 1, 1999, the Company entered into an
amended and restated agreement with Rainwater, Inc., whereby the Company will
pay Rainwater, Inc. $300,000 per year and reimburse Rainwater, Inc. for certain
expenses in consideration for certain consulting and financial analysis services
provided to the Company by Rainwater, Inc. and its representatives. The term of
this agreement expires on December 31, 2003. During 2000, 1999 and 1998,
consulting and financial analysis services provided to the Company totaled
$300,000, $325,000 and $400,000, respectively, plus expenses. Richard E.
Rainwater, who resigned from the Company Board of Directors during 2000, is
the sole shareholder of Rainwater, Inc.

December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan
In August 1997, the Company stockholders approved a long-term incentive
plan the Long-Term Incentive Plan, which provides for the granting of
incentive awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and restricted stock to directors, officers and employees of
the Company. The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum
number of shares of common stock equal to 10 percent of the total number of
shares of common stock equivalents outstanding minus the total number of shares
of common stock subject to outstanding awards that are exercisable on or within
60 days subsequent to the date of calculation under any stock-based plan for the
directors, officers or employees of the Company.
The following table calculates the number of shares or options available

Stock option awards. The Company has a program of awarding semi-annual
stock options to its officers and employees and annual stock options to its
non-employee directors, as part of their annual compensation. This program
provides for annual awards at an exercise price based upon the closing sales
price of the Company common stock on the day prior to the date of grant.
Employee Stock Option awards vest over an 18 month or three year schedule and
provide a five year exercise period from each vesting date. Non-employee
directors' stock options vest quarterly and provide for a five year exercise
period from each vesting date. The Company granted 1,439,035, 1,945,135 and
2,146,553 options under the Long-Term Incentive Plan during 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Restricted stock awards. There were no restricted stock awards to
employees or non-employee directors during the year ended December 31, 2000.
During 1999 and 1998, the Company awarded an aggregate of 6,200 shares and
137,086 shares, respectively, of restricted stock at an average price per share
of $2956 in 1999 and $2113 in 1998.
Other stock based plans. Prior to the merger with Mesa, both Parker &
Parsley and Mesa had long-term incentive plans Parker & Parsley Long-Term
Incentive Plan, 1991 Stock Option Plan of Mesa and the 1996 Incentive Plan of
Mesa in place that allowed Parker & Parsley and Mesa to grant incentive awards
similar to the provisions of the Long-Term Incentive Plan. Upon consummation of
the merger between Parker & Parsley and Mesa, all awards under these plans were
assumed by the Company with the provision that no additional awards be granted
under these plans.
SFAS 123  disclosures.  The  Company  applies APB 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock option awards. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option awards. If

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
During 1997, the Company established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
ESPP that allows eligible employees to annually purchase Pioneer common stock
at a discounted price. Officers of the Company are not eligible to participate
in the ESPP. Contributions to the ESPP are limited to 15 percent of employees'
pay subject to certain ESPP limits during the nine month offering period.
Participants in the ESPP purchase the Company common stock at a price that is
15 percent below the closing sales price of the Company common stock on either
the first day or the last day of each annual offering period, whichever closing
sales price is lower.
NOTE G.   Commitments and Contingencies
Severance agreements. The Company has entered into severance agreements
with its officers, subsidiary company officers and certain key employees.
Salaries and bonuses for the Company officers are set by the Compensation
Committee for the parent company officers and the Management Committee for
subsidiary company officers and key employees. These committees can grant
increases or reductions to base salary at their discretion. The current annual
salaries for the parent company officers, the subsidiary company officers and
key employees covered under such agreements total approximately $92 million.
Indemnifications. The Company has indemnified its directors and certain
of its officers, employees and agents with respect to claims and damages arising
from acts or omissions taken in such capacity, as well as with respect to
certain litigation.
Legal actions. The Company is party to various legal actions incidental
to its business, including, but not limited to, the proceedings described below.
The majority of these lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising from
oil and gas leases and ownership interest disputes. The Company believes that
the ultimate disposition of these legal actions will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company consolidated financial position, liquidity, capital
resources or future results of operations. The Company will continue to evaluate
its litigation matters on a quarter-by- quarter basis and will adjust its
litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect the then current status of
litigation.
Masterson. In February 1992, the current lessors of an oil and gas lease
the Gas Lease dated April 30, 1955, between R.B. Masterson et al., as
lessor, and Colorado Interstate Gas Company CIG, as lessee, sued CIG in
Federal District Court in Amarillo, Texas, claiming that CIG had underpaid
royalties due under the Gas Lease. Under the agreements with CIG, the Company,
as successor to MESA Inc. Mesa, has an entitlement to gas produced from the
Gas Lease. In August 1992, CIG filed a third-party complaint against the Company
for any such royalty underpayment which may be allocable to the Company.
Plaintiffs alleged that the underpayment was the result of CIG use of an
improper gas sales price upon which to calculate royalties and that the proper
price should have been determined pursuant to a favored-nations clause in a
July 1, 1967 amendment to the Gas Lease. The plaintiffs also sought a
declaration by the court as to the proper price to be used for calculating
future royalties.
The plaintiffs alleged royalty underpayments of approximately $500
million including interest at 10 percent dating from July 1, 1967. In March
1995, the court made certain pretrial rulings that eliminated approximately $400
million of the plaintiff claims which related to periods prior to October 1,
1989, but which also reduced a number of the Company defenses. The Company
and CIG filed stipulations with the court whereby the Company would have been
liable for between 50 percent and 60 percent, depending on the time period
covered, of an adverse judgment against CIG for post-February 1988 underpayments
of royalties.
53             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998    On March 22, 1995, a jury trial began and on May 4, 1995, the jury
returned its verdict. Among its findings, the jury determined that CIG had
underpaid royalties for the period after September 30, 1989, in the amount of
approximately  $140,000.  Although  the  plaintiffs  argued  that  the
favored-nations clause entitled them to be paid for all of their gas at the
highest price voluntarily paid by CIG to any other lessor, the jury determined
that the plaintiffs were estopped from claiming that the favored-nations
clause provides for other than a pricing-scheme to pricing- scheme comparison.
In light of this determination, and the plaintiff stipulation that a
pricing-scheme to pricing-scheme comparison would not result in any trigger
prices or damages, defendants asked the court for a judgment that plaintiffs
take nothing. The court, on June 7, 1995, entered final judgment that plaintiffs
recover no monetary damages. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial on
June 22, 1995. The court, on July 18, 1997, denied plaintiffs' motion. The
plaintiffs appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and on September 8,
2000, the Fifth Circuit Court affirmed the take nothing judgment of the trial
court.
On June 7, 1996, the plaintiffs filed a separate suit against CIG and the
Company in state court in Amarillo, Texas, similarly claiming underpayment of
royalties under the favored-nations clause, but based upon the above-
described pricing-scheme to pricing-scheme comparison on a well-by-well monthly
basis. The plaintiffs also claim underpayment of royalties since June 7, 1995
under the favored-nations clause based upon either the pricing-scheme to
pricing-scheme method or their previously alleged higher price method. The
Company believes it has several defenses to this action and intends to contest
it vigorously. The Company has not yet determined the amount of damages, if any,
that would be payable if such action was determined adversely to the Company.
Based on the final judgment which has been affirmed by the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals, the Company does not currently expect the ultimate resolution
of the second lawsuit to have a material adverse effect on its financial
position or results of operations.
Kansas ad valorem tax. The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 NGPA allows
a severance, production or similar tax to be included as an add-on, over and
above the maximum lawful price for gas. Based on a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission FERC ruling that Kansas ad valorem tax was such a tax, Mesa
collected the Kansas ad valorem tax in addition to the otherwise maximum lawful
price. The FERC ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia D.C. Circuit, which held in June 1988 that the FERC
failed to provide a reasoned basis for its findings and remanded the case to the
FERC for further consideration.
On December 1, 1993, the FERC issued an order reversing its prior ruling,
but limiting the effect of its decision to Kansas ad valorem taxes for sales
made on or after June 28, 1988. The FERC clarified the effective date of its
decision by an order dated May 18, 1994. The order clarified that the effective
date applies to tax bills rendered after June 28, 1988, not sales made on or
after that date. Numerous parties filed appeals on the FERC action in the D.C.
Circuit. Various gas producers challenged the FERC orders on two grounds: 1
that the Kansas ad valorem tax, properly understood,  does qualify for
reimbursement under the NGPA; and 2 the FERC ruling should, in any event,
have been applied prospectively. Other parties challenged the FERC orders on
the grounds that the FERC ruling should have been applied retroactively to
December 1, 1978, the date of the enactment of the NGPA and producers should
have been required to pay refunds accordingly.
The D.C. Circuit issued its decision on August 2, 1996, which holds that
producers must make refunds of all Kansas ad valorem tax collected with respect
to production since October 4, 1983, as opposed to June 28, 1988. Petitions for
rehearing were denied on November 6, 1996. Various gas producers subsequently
filed a petition for writ of certiori with the United States Supreme Court
seeking to limit the scope of the potential refunds to tax bills rendered on or
after June 28, 1988 the effective date originally selected by the FERC.
Williams Natural Gas Company filed a cross-petition for certiori seeking to
impose refund liability back to December 1, 1978. Both petitions were denied on
May 12, 1997.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998    The Company and other producers filed petitions for adjustment with the
FERC on June 24, 1997. The Company was seeking waiver or set-off from FERC with
respect to that portion of the refund associated with i non- recoupable
royalties, ii non-recoupable Kansas property taxes based, in part, upon the
higher prices collected, and iii interest for all periods. On September 10,
1997, FERC denied this request, and on October 10, 1997, the Company and other
producers filed a request for rehearing. Pipelines were given until November 10,
1997 to file claims on refunds sought from producers and refunds totaling
approximately $30 million were made against the Company. The Company is unable
at this time to predict the final outcome of this matter or the amount, if any,
that will ultimately be refunded. As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company
had on deposit $281 million and $313 million, respectively, including accrued
interest, in an escrow account and had corresponding obligations for this
litigation  recorded in other current  liabilities  in the  accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2000, the Company paid $39 million in
partial settlement of original claims presented under this litigation.
Lease agreements. The Company leases equipment and office facilities
under noncancellable operating leases on which rental expense for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately $70 million, $69
million and $89 million, respectively. Future minimum lease commitments under
noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 2000 are as follows in
thousands       $ 5,852

NOTE H.   Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company, from time to time, uses derivative instruments to manage
interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity price risks. Associated
therewith, the Company is exposed to credit losses if the counterparties to the
derivative instruments fail to perform. The Company uses credit and other
financial criteria to select counterparties and, based thereon, believes that
the Company counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations
under the contracts. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or
otherwise secure derivative instruments, associated credit risk is mitigated by
monitoring the credit standing of the counterparties on an ongoing basis.
Hedge Derivatives
Interest rate swap agreements. During 2000, the Company entered into
interest rate swap agreements to hedge the fair value of a portion of its fixed
rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements are for an aggregate notional
amount of $150 million of debt; commenced on April 19, 2000 and mature on April
15, 2005; require the counterparties to pay the Company a fixed annual rate of
8875 percent on the notional amount; and, require the Company to pay the
counterparties a variable annual rate on the notional amount equal to the
periodic three month LIBOR plus a weighted average margin rate of 1782 basis
points. During 1999 and 1998, the Company was a party to a series of interest
rate swap agreements that matured during May and June 1999. Under the terms of
the interest rate swap agreements, the Company paid a variable rate on a
notional amount of $150 million of debt and received a fixed annual rate of 662
percent on the notional amount. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998 include reductions in interest expense of $294 thousand 849 thousand and $356 thousand, respectively, associated with interest rate
swap agreements accounted for as hedges.

Non-hedge Derivatives
As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company has recognized liabilities
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of $255 million and $306
million, respectively, associated with non-hedge derivative instruments. See
Note C for information regarding the Company determination of the fair values
of derivative instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998, the Company recognized mark-to-market charges of $585 million, $270
million and $212 million, respectively.
Foreign currency agreements. The Company was a party to a series of
forward foreign exchange rate swap agreements that exchanged Canadian dollars
for United States dollars. These agreements matured during 2000. As these
contracts did not qualify as hedges, the Company recorded mark-to-market
adjustments to increase the associated contract liabilities by $19 million
during 2000 and to decrease the associated contract liabilities by $59 million
during 1999.
Btu swap agreements. During 1996, Mesa entered into Btu swap agreements
covering 13,036 MMBtu per day from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2004.
Under the terms of these agreements, the Company received a premium of $52 per

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 MMBtu over market gas prices from January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998.
Additionally, the Company receives 10 percent of the NYMEX oil price for the
volumes covered for a six-year period ending December 31, 2004. As these
derivative  contracts  do not qualify as hedges,  the Company  recorded
mark-to-market adjustments to increase the carrying value of the Btu swap
liability by $146 million during the year ended December 31, 2000 and to reduce
the carrying value of the Btu swap liability by $222 thousand during the year
ended December 31, 1999. During 2000, the Company terminated its position in the
Btu swap agreements for the 2001 volumes and locked-in a loss of $67 million
related to the terminated positions. The remaining contracts will continue to be
marked- to-market at the end of each reporting period during their respective
lives. The related effects on the Company results of operations in future
periods could be significant.
Other non-hedge commodity derivatives. During 1999, the Company sold call
options that provided the counterparties an option to exercise calls either on
10,000 barrels per day of oil, at a strike price of $2000 per barrel, or on
100,000 MMBtu per day of gas, at a weighted average strike price of $275 per
MMBtu. These contracts, which matured during 2000, did not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment. Other expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements
of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss include $420 million and $212
million of mark-to-market charges for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively, associated with these call options.
NOTE I.   Sales to Major Customers
The Company share of oil and gas production is sold to various
purchasers. The Company is of the opinion that the loss of any one purchaser
would not have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to sell its oil
and gas production.
The following customers individually accounted for 10 percent or more of
the consolidated oil, NGL and gas revenues of the Company during the years ended

NOTE J.   Interest and Other Income
During 1999, the Company received an excise tax refund of $302 million.
Due to uncertainties surrounding the collectability of this refund, the Company
had not previously recognized it as an asset. Accordingly, the Company
recognized the tax refund as other income during 1999.
In December 1998, the Company announced the sale of an exclusive and
irrevocable option to purchase certain oil and gas properties of the Company.
The third party was unable to complete the purchase on or before March 31, 1999.
In payment for the option and related liquidated damages, the third party paid
the Company $418 million, which was recorded as other income in 1999.

NOTE L.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In December 1998, the Company estimated the expected future cash flows of
its proved oil and gas properties as of December 31, 1998 based upon the
Company outlook for future commodity prices and the Company assessment of
performance issues relative to certain of its oil and gas properties. The
estimated future cash flows were compared with the respective carrying amounts
of the properties to determine if the carrying amounts were likely to be
recoverable. For those proved oil and gas properties for which the carrying
amount exceeded the estimated future cash flows, an impairment was determined to
exist; therefore, the Company adjusted the carrying amounts of those proved oil
and gas properties to their fair values. The fair values were determined by
discounting the properties' expected future cash flows at a discount rate
commensurate with the risks involved in the industry. As a result, the Company
recognized a non-cash impairment provision of $3122 million related to its
proved oil and gas properties during 1998.
Based on the Company 1999 and 1998 assessment of its unproved
properties, the Company recognized non- cash unproved property impairment
provisions of $179 million and $1473  million  during 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
See Note O for disclosure of these impairment charges by geographic
operating segment.

December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 NOTE M.   Reorganization
During 1998, the Company announced plans to sell certain non-strategic
oil and gas fields, its intentions to reorganize its operations by combining its
six domestic operating regions, and other cost reduction initiatives intended to
allow the  Company to realize  greater  operational  and  administrative
efficiencies. Specific cost reduction initiatives included the relocation of
most of the Company administrative services from Midland, Texas to Irving,
Texas; the closings of the Company regional offices in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, Corpus Christi, Texas and Houston, Texas; the termination of 350
employees; and, further centralization of the Company organization structure.
The consolidation of administrative services to Irving and the closing of the
Corpus Christi, Texas office were completed in 1998. The Company completed the
closings of the Houston, Texas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma offices during 1999
and further centralized certain operational functions in Irving, Texas. The
unpaid office closing amounts primarily relate to lease commitments on the
office buildings in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Corpus Christi, Texas, and Houston,
Texas. As a result of the reorganization initiatives, the Company recognized
reorganization charges of $85 million and $332 million during 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
The following table provides a description of the components of the
reorganization charges and unpaid portions of the charges as of December 31,

NOTE N.   Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated United
States federal income tax return. Certain subsidiaries are not eligible to be

groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable income or loss are
subject to examination by United States federal, state and foreign taxing
authorities. Current and estimated tax payments of $46 million, $800 thousand
and $300 thousand were made in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. In addition,

Realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss
carryforwards  NOLs and other credit carryforwards is dependent upon
generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration. The Company
believes that there is a risk that certain of these NOLs and other credit
carryforwards may expire unused and, accordingly, has established a valuation
allowance of $2834 million against them. Although realization is not assured
for the remaining deferred tax asset, the Company believes it is more likely
than not that they will be realized through future taxable earnings or
alternative tax planning strategies. However, the net deferred tax assets could
be reduced further if the Company estimate of taxable income in future periods
is significantly reduced or alternative tax planning strategies are no longer
viable.
At December 31, 2000, the Company had NOLs for United States, Argentine,
Canadian, and South African income tax purposes of $9416 million, $76 million 230 million and $240 million, respectively, which are available to offset
future regular taxable income in each respective tax jurisdiction, if any.
Additionally, at December 31, 2000, the Company has alternative minimum tax net
operating loss carryforwards AMT NOLs in the United States of $8290
million, which are available to reduce future alternative minimum taxable
income, if any. These carryforwards expire as follows                    62             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 NOTE P.   Income Loss Per Share
Basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted net income loss per
share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or
resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings
of the entity. Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of
99,378,314 and 99,762,664, respectively, were used in the computation of the
Company net income per share for the year ended  December 31, 2000.
In-the-money options representing 384,350 weighted average equivalent shares
were included in the diluted computation for 2000, but did not cause the
reported basic and diluted income per share amounts to differ.
Common stock options to purchase 4,911,749 shares, 5,274,964 shares and
2,817,822 shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the
computations of diluted net income loss per share for 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, because the exercise prices of the options were greater than the
average market price of the common shares and would be anti-dilutive to the
computations. In-the-money options representing 158,556 and 434,118 weighted
average equivalent shares of common stock were not included in the computations
of diluted net income loss per share for 1999 and 1998, respectively, since
they have an anti-dilutive effect to the net losses recognized for those years.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Years Ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 Results of Operations
Information about the Company results of operations for oil and gas
producing activities is presented in Note O of the accompanying Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reserve Quantity Information
The estimates of the Company proved oil and gas reserves, which are
located principally in the United States, Argentina, Canada and South Africa are
prepared by the Company engineers. Reserves were estimated in accordance with
guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board,
which require that reserve estimates be prepared under existing economic and
operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except by
contractual arrangements. The reserve estimates for 2000, 1999 and 1998 utilize
respective oil prices of $2571, $2433 and $1009 per Bbl reflecting
adjustments for oil quality and gathering and transportation costs; respective
NGL prices of $1674, $1759 and $681 per Bbl; and, respective gas prices of
$750, $183 and $164 per Mcf reflecting adjustments for Btu content,
gathering and transportation costs and gas processing and shrinkage.
Oil and gas reserve  quantity  estimates are subject to numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in
the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development
expenditures. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of
available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
Results of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either upward
or downward revision of previous estimates. Further, the volumes considered to
be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices and operating
costs. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise
and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently
producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to
change as additional information becomes available in the future.

UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Years Ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed
by applying year-end prices of oil and gas with consideration of price changes
only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to the estimated future
production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future expenditures
based on year-end costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves, discounted using a rate of 10 percent per year to reflect the
estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future income taxes are calculated by
comparing discounted future cash flows to the tax basis of oil and gas
properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying the current tax
rates to the difference.
Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not
intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties.
Estimates of fair value should also consider probable reserves, anticipated
future oil and gas prices, interest rates, changes in development and production
costs and risks associated with future production. Because of these and other
considerations, any estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and
imprecise.                                 For the Year Ended December 31,
