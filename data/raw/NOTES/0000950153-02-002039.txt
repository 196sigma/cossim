Employment and Deferred Compensation Agreements. In December 1993, we entered
into an employment agreement and deferred compensation agreement with Dr.John
G. Sperling, our Chairman of the Board. The term of the employment agreement
was for five years and expired on December31, 1997. The employment agreement
has automatically renewed for four additional one-year periods through December
31, 2002, and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods
thereafter. Under the terms of the employment agreement, Dr.Sperling received
an annual salary of $450,000 for 2002 and 2001 and $400,000 for 2000. This
salary is subject to annual
review by the Compensation Committee. We may terminate the employment
agreement only for cause, and Dr.Sperling may terminate the employment
agreement at any time upon 30days written notice.
The deferred compensation agreement provides that upon his termination of
employment with us and until his death, Dr.Sperling shall receive monthly
payments equal to one-twelfth of his highest annual base salary paid by us
during any one of the three calendar years preceding the calendar year in which
Dr.Sperlings employment is terminated. In addition, upon Dr.Sperlings
death, his designated beneficiary shall be paid an amount equal to three times
his highest annual base salary in 36 equal monthly installments with the first
such installment due on the first day of the month following the month of Dr.
Sperlings death.
We do not have employment agreements with any of our other executive
officers.
Board Compensation Committee Report on Executive Compensation Our Compensation Committee the Committee is composed entirely of
independent outside members of our Board of Directors. The committee reviews
and approves each of the elements of our executive compensation program related
to our executive officers, including, John G. Sperling and Todd S. Nelson the
Senior Executives, and periodically assesses the effectiveness and
competitiveness of the program in total. In addition, the committee
administers the key provisions of the executive compensation program and
reviews with our Board of Directors in detail all aspects of compensation for
our Senior Executives. The committee has furnished the following report on
executive compensation Overview and Philosophy. Our compensation program for executive officers
is primarily comprised of base salary, annual bonus, and long-term incentives
in the form of stock option grants. Executive officers also participate in
various other benefit plans, including medical and retirement plans, generally
available to all of our employees.
Each of the executive officers receives a base salary, which when
aggregated with their maximum bonus amount, is intended to be competitive with
similarly situated executives in comparable industries, including those
companies in the peer group contained in the Stock Performance Graph. The
companies surveyed had annual revenues ranging from approximately $919million
to $6476million, with an average of $3870million and a median of $4477
million. This data was used to target annual cash compensation for the
executive officers at the higher end of companies surveyed.
Our philosophy is to pay base salaries to the executive officers that
enable us to attract, motivate, and retain highly qualified executives. The
annual bonus program is designed to reward for performance based on financial
results. Stock option grants are intended to provide substantial rewards to
executives based on stock price appreciation and improved overall financial
performance. The vesting of the options can be accelerated if certain profit
goals are achieved.
Base Salary. Salary increases for the executive officers are based on a
review of the competitive data described above. We target base pay at the
level required to attract and retain highly qualified executives. In
determining salaries, the committee also takes into account position within us,
individual experience and performance, our revenue size compared to the
companies surveyed, and our specific needs particular to us.

Annual Bonus Program. In addition to a base salary, executive officers
were eligible to receive a bonus. Bonus amounts for executive officers are
determined annually based on a review of the competitive data described above.
We target bonuses at the level required to attract and retain highly qualified
executives. Bonus amounts are paid if certain goals are achieved.
Options. We believe that it is important for executive officers to have
an equity stake in us, and, toward this end, we make option grants to key
executive officers from time to time under the Apollo Group, Inc. 2000 Stock
Incentive Plan. In making option awards, the Compensation Committee reviews
our financial performance during the past fiscal year, the awards granted to
other executives, and the individual officers specific role.
Other Benefits. Executive officers are eligible to participate in benefit
programs designed for all of our full-time employees and certain of our
executive officers also received certain perquisites, primarily including
company cars and company paid tax consulting. These programs include medical,
disability and life insurance, and a qualified retirement program allowed under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Compensation. Dr.John
G. Sperling is the founder and Chairman of our Board of Directors. In December
1993, we entered into an employment agreement the Employment Agreement and
deferred compensation agreement the Deferred Compensation Agreement with
Dr.Sperling. The Employment Agreement terminated on December31, 1997. The
Employment Agreement has automatically renewed for four additional one-year
periods through December31, 2002, and will
automatically renew for additional one-year periods thereafter. The Deferred
Compensation Agreement provides that upon Dr.Sperlings termination of
employment with us and until his death, Dr.Sperling shall receive monthly
payments equal to one-twelfth of his highest annual base salary paid by us
during any one of the three calendar years preceding the calendar year in which
Dr.Sperlings employment is terminated. In addition, upon Dr.Sperlings
death, his designated beneficiary shall be paid an amount equal to three times
his highest annual base salary in 36 equal monthly installments with the first
installment due on the first day of the month following the month of Dr.
Sperlings death.
Dr.Sperlings base salary is determined annually on the same basis
discussed above for the executive officers. During fiscal year 2002, Dr.
Sperling received an annual base salary of $450,000. Dr.Sperlings bonus is
tied solely to our earnings per share. At the beginning of each fiscal year,
the Compensation Committee establishes an earnings per share goal for us. If
that goal is achieved, Dr.Sperling earns a bonus up to seventy-five percent
75% of his respective annual salary. Because the earnings per share goal for
us was exceeded, Dr.Sperling was eligible for a bonus for 2002. Dr.Sperling
has elected to forego this bonus in exchange for options in our Apollo
Education Group ClassA common stock. The amount of options to be granted will
be determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and will be
granted at fair market value and expire ten years after the grant date. The
Compensation Committee does not apply a mathematical formula to determine the
number of options granted, but will consider Dr.Sperlings contribution to our
performance during fiscal year 2002.
Todd S. Nelson is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr.Nelsons
base salary and bonus are determined annually on the same basis discussed above
for Dr.Sperling except that in addition to a bonus equal to seventy-five 75%
of his annual salary, Mr.Nelson is entitled to an additional amount for every
cent we are over our earnings per share goal. During 2002, Mr.Nelson received
an annual base salary of $500,000. Because the earnings per share goal for us
was exceeded, Mr.Nelson earned a bonus for 2002 of $2,575,000. As a result of
Mr.Nelsons performance during 2002, the Compensation Committee also granted
Mr.Nelson options to acquire 225,000 shares of Apollo Education Group ClassA
common stock and 200,000 shares of University of Phoenix Online
common stock,
at an exercise price based on the fair market value on the date of grant.
These options vest twenty-five 25% per year for four years, unless future
earnings per share goals established by the Compensation Committee are
achieved, in which case the vesting schedule for these options will accelerate.
Compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section162m. Section162m of
the Code limits the deductibility of executive compensation paid by publicly
held corporations to $1million for each executive officer named in this
report. The $1million limitation generally does not apply to compensation
that is pursuant to a performance-based plan approved by shareholders. The
Companys policy is to comply with the requirements of Section162m and
maintain deductibility for all executive compensation, except in circumstances
where we conclude on an informed basis that it is in the best interest of the
Company and the shareholders to take actions with regard to the payment of
executive compensation which do not qualify for tax deductibility.
Based on our understanding of the regulations under Section162m, we
believe that the full amount of compensation for each executive officer named
in this report will be deductible. 27 Table of Contents
