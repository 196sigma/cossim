ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc.
We have audited accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pacific Gateway
Exchange, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
related statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. We
have also audited the financial statement schedule listed in Item 14a of the
Form 10-K. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Pacific
Gateway Exchange, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information required to be included therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business and Organization:
Pacific Gateway Exchange, Inc. Pacific Gateway or the Company, a
Delaware corporation, owns and operates an international switched and domestic
switched telecommunications network. The operations of Pacific Gateway have
grown significantly as the result of entering into additional operating
agreements with foreign partners and marketing to certain long distance
companies in the United States which do not have their own international
network.
Principals of Consolidation:
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pacific Gateway and
majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Investments in 20% to 50%-owned
affiliates are accounted for on the equity method. Intercompany transactions
have been eliminated.
Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market accounts and called bonds
with maturities of three months or less. The carrying amount reported in the
accompanying balance sheets approximates fair market value.
Property and Equipment:
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided for
financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the following
estimated useful lives:
Undersea fiber optic  20 years
Long distance communications  5-7 years
Computers and office  4-7 years
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Replacements and
betterments are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of
assets sold or retired are removed from the account balance, and any resulting
gain or loss is reflected in results of operations.
Income Taxes:
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS 109 has as its basic objective the recognition of current and deferred
income tax assets and liabilities based upon all events that have been
recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of the
enacted tax laws.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the estimated amount to be realized. Income tax expense represents
the tax payable for the current period and the change during the period in the
deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition:
Revenues for telecommunications services provided to customers are recognized
as services are rendered. Revenues for return traffic received according to the
terms of the Company operating agreements with its foreign partners are
recognized as revenue as the return traffic is received.
38
PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Earnings Per Share:
Earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of stock
committed to be issued and stock options determined using the treasury stock
method. The earnings per share calculation has been adjusted for all periods
presented to reflect the 940 to 1 stock split effected October 20, 1995.
Additionally, this calculation treats stock options granted prior to the
Company initial public offering as if they were common stock equivalents for
all periods presented.
Financial Statement Classifications:
Certain amounts on the accompanying financial statements for 1995 have been
reclassified to conform to the 1996 presentation. Such reclassifications have
no effect on net income as previously reported.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The carrying amounts for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
their fair value. The revolving lines of credit had an interest rate which
varied with the prime rate and approximates the current interest rate for
similar financial instruments as of December 31, 1995. Therefore, the recorded
amount of the revolving lines of credit as of December 31, 1995, approximated
fair market value.
Concentration of Credit Risk:
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable.
At December 31, 1996 and 1995 the Company had bank deposits in excess of
federally insured limits of $45,381,000 and $1,592,000, respectively. Seven of
the Company customers accounted for approximately 52% and 55% of gross
accounts receivable as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers but generally does not
require collateral to support customer receivables. The Company allowance for
doubtful accounts is based on current market conditions. Losses on
uncollectible accounts have consistently been within management expectations.
2 ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE TRAFFIC
The Company has entered into operating agreements with 30 telecommunications
carriers in 24 different countries under which international long distance
traffic is both delivered and received. Under these agreements, the foreign
carriers are contractually obligated to adhere to the policy of the Federal
Communications Commission the FCC, whereby traffic from the foreign country
is routed to international carriers, such as the Company, in the same
proportion as traffic carried into the country. Mutually exchanged traffic
between the Company and foreign carriers is settled through a formal settlement
policy that generally extends over a six-month period at an agreed upon rate.
The Company records the amount due to the foreign partner as an expense in the
period the traffic is delivered. Of the 30 agreements the Company had at
December 31, 1996, 11 agreements provided that the company generally must wait
up to six months before it actually receives the proportional return traffic.
For these agreements, the Company recognizes a loss in the period in which it
sells to a customer because the amount due to the foreign partner generally
exceeds the amount the Company charges its customers. As a result, a
significant increase in traffic with one or more of the carriers with which the
Company must wait up to six months to receive return traffic may cause the
Company to report a net loss in the accounting period in which such increase
occurred. Historically, when the return traffic is received in the future
period, the Company generally realizes a gross margin on the return traffic
that, when combined with the prior period loss on the outbound traffic, results
in a gross profit on the total transaction. As the Company has historically
been a net outpayer to these foreign companies it does not actually pay its
accounts payable balance until it receives the
39
PACIFIC GATEWAY EXCHANGE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
return traffic that it is owed. Although the Company can reasonably estimate
the revenue it will receive under the FCC proportional share policy, there
is no guarantee that there will be traffic delivered back to the United States
or what impact changes in future settlement rates will have on net payments
made and revenue received.
3 INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1996    1995    1994
CURRENT TAX EXPENSE
U.S.  $3,364,342 $ 999,950 $206,647
State and   841,085 $ 249,988 $ 51,662
Total  $4,205,427 $1,249,938 $258,309
DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE
U.S.   262,558  75,950 42,647
State and   65,640  18,988 10,662
Total   328,198  94,938 53,309
Total  $3,877,229 $1,155,000 $205,000
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the statutory federal income tax rates as follows:
YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31,
1996  1995 1994
Expected statutory  340 % 340% 340 %
Release of valuation   --   -- 151%
State income taxes, net of federal benefit. 53 % 53%  55 %
Tax exempt  04%  --        11 %  --                                                                   400 % 393% 244 %
As a result of operating losses in 1992 and 1993 and the fact that the
Company had a limited operating history, a valuation allowance equal to the
deferred tax asset was recorded at December 31, 1993. The Company was
profitable for the first time in 1994 which allowed it to release the
previously recorded deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes and the impact of available
net operating loss carryforwards.

Net deferred tax assets. $ 476,445 $148,247 $53,309
4 REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT
At December 31, 1995, the Company had a revolving line of credit with Ronald
L. Jensen, a principal stockholder of the Company, which matured on the
completion of the initial public offering in July 1996. Interest was payable
monthly at prime 825% at June 30, 1996, 875% at December 31, 1995 and 90%
at December 31, 1994 plus 2%. The outstanding balance under this line of
credit of $3,301,890 was repaid on July 24, 1996. The amount outstanding under
this line, which was subordinated to the amount due the commercial lender, was
$2,420,339 and $4,487,724 at December 31, 1995, and December 31, 1994,
respectively.
In 1995, the Company entered into an additional revolving line of credit with
a commercial lender under which it was able to borrow the lesser of $3,000,000
or 70% of certain of the Company accounts receivable. Interest was payable at
the lenders prime rate plus 0875%. This line of credit was paid down on June
6, 1996 and expired in September, 1996. The amount outstanding under this line
at December 31, 1995, was $3,000,000.
5 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company provides certain domestic and international switched
telecommunications services to Matrix Telecom, Inc. Matrix, which is a
switchless reseller. Ronald L. Jensen and his five adult children, as a group,
own a controlling interest in Matrix and also own a significant, but not
controlling interest in the Company. Revenues recorded from providing these
services were $20,514,040, 17,165,995 and $9,211,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 respectively. Matrix also provided certain
data processing services to the Company for which the Company incurred expenses
of $246,221, $166,000, and $35,000 in 1996, 1995 and 1994 respectively. These
functions were taken over by the company in June 1996 and it is not anticipated
that Matrix will provide any of these services in the future. The amount
receivable from Matrix was $3,065,846, $3,261,849 and $2,203,000 at December
31, 1996, 1995, and 1994 respectively.
In February 1995, the Company accepted certain shares of common stock, with a
fair market value of approximately $702,000, of a customer as payment for
accounts receivable totaling $702,000. The Company then sold this stock to
Ronald L. Jensen for $702,000. Mr. Jensen subsequently sold the stock over a
period of several months for a total of $730,000.
At December 31, 1995, the Company had advances receivable from the officers
of the Company totaling $175,000. These advances were due on demand and were
repaid in the first quarter of 1996.

6 SEGMENT DATA
The Company classifies its operations into one industry segment,
telecommunications services. Export sales were $46,522,000, $17,619,000 and
$4,572,000 for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 respectively.
Export sales by geographic area were as follows:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

To date the Company international operating agreements have been with
entities operating in countries where management does not expect political or
economic forces to cause disruption in telecommunications traffic to or from
these countries.
The Company sells to the long distance companies in the United States which
do not have their own international network and to its foreign partners. At
December 31, 1996, the Company had 30 operating agreements and approximately 75
United States customers. Because it has a small number of large customers, 10%
or more of the Company revenues have been derived from the following
customers.

In December, 1996, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which
is effective for both interim periods and annual periods ending after December
15, 1997. SFAS 128 establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings
per share EPS. This statement replaces the presentation of primary EPS with
a presentation of basic EPS. It also requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex
capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and
denominator of the basic EPS computation to the numerator and denominator of
the diluted EPS computation. The Company does not expect the impact on the
financial statements to be material.
