Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
36 29 Independent Auditors' Report To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of MITY Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MITY Enterprises, Inc.
formerly Mity-Lite, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2001.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
MITY Enterprises' management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  We did not audit the financial statements of DO Group, Inc. for
the years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, MITY Enterprises' investment in which is accounted
for by use of the equity method.  MITY Enterprises' equity of $1,672,000 in DO Group net
assets at March 31, 2000, and of $368,000 and $480,000 in DO Groups net income for the
years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, are included in the accompanying financial
statements.  The financial statements of DO Group, Inc. for the years ended March 31, 2000 and
1999 were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion,
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for such company, is based solely on the report of
such other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MITY
Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries at March 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2001 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Salt Lake City, Utah

manufactures multipurpose room furniture, specialty office seating and systems furniture, and
healthcare seating and markets these products in niche markets. In addition, the Company
continues to pursue acquisitions of product lines or companies that will be complementary to the
Company businesses. The Company markets its products throughout the United States, Canada
and in certain foreign countries. In August of 2000, the Company changed its name from Mity-Lite, Inc. to MITY Enterprises, Inc. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate
For the years ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company investment in its unconsolidated
affiliate, DO Group, Inc., was accounted for using the equity method see Note 4. Investment in
and Note Receivable from Affiliate. On April 1, 2000, the Company acquired the remaining
interest in DO Group and began reporting DO Group on a consolidated basis see Note 5. Recent
Acquisitions. Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of MITY Enterprises,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments which have a term maturity not
greater than three months. Available-for-Sale Securities 
Debt securities, which consist of municipal bonds, corporate bonds and government agency
securities, are classified as available-for-sale. When the fair value of available-for-sale securities
differs from the amortized cost, the resulting unrealized gain or loss is recorded as a component
of comprehensive income. The amortization of premiums and discounts on debt securities in this
category are included in investment income and reflected in the amortized cost of the debt
securities. The cost of securities sold during the period is based on the specific identification
method. Interest on securities in this category are included in investment income.  At March 31,
2000, the Company did not own any available-for-sale securities. The contractual maturities of the available-for-sale securities held at March 31, 2001 are
summarized below   
Amortized Cost

Due in one year or less
$178,000

$1,180,000 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, on a first in, first out basis, or market. 36 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as
incurred, whereas major replacements and improvements are capitalized and subsequently
depreciated. Depreciation and amortization on the Company property and equipment are
provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows   
Estimated Useful
Life in years
Machinery and equipment
5 to 10
Furniture and fixtures
3 to 5
Leasehold improvements
5 to 15
Buildings and improvements
30
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets represent goodwill and patents. Goodwill that arose on the DO Group and
Broda acquisitions is amortized on a straight line basis over a twenty-year period. Patents are
amortized over three years using a straight line basis. Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of product. Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of trade receivables and cash equivalents. In the normal course of business, the
Company provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses which, when
realized, have been within the range of management expectations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of the note receivable from affiliate approximates its book value at March 31, 2000.
The fair value of available-for-sale securities exceeds cost by $2,000 as of March 31, 2001. The
Company did not own any available-for-sale securities at March 31, 2000. The carrying amount
reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts
payable approximates fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. Income Taxes see Note 10. Income Taxes
MITY Enterprises uses an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for
income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the bases of assets
and liabilities as reported for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes. Stock-Based Compensation
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation requires expanded disclosures of stock-based compensation arrangements with
employees and encourages but does not require compensation cost to be measured based on the
fair value of the equity instrument awarded. Since MITY Enterprises has decided to continue
applying Accounting Principles Board APB Statement No. 25 as permitted by SFAS No. 123,
the appropriate required disclosure of the effects of SFAS No. 123 are included in Note 8. 37 Use of Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance
for doubtful accounts receivable, the reserve for obsolete inventory, and accruals for warranty
expense. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Long-Lived Assets
Impairment of long-lived assets is determined in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and of Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. The
Company evaluates the carrying value of long-term assets based on current and anticipated
undiscounted cash flows and recognizes an impairment when such estimated cash flows will be
less than the carrying value of the asset. Measurement of the amount of impairment, if any, is
based upon the difference between carrying value and fair value. During the year ended March 31, 2001, the Company announced it was seeking a potential buyer
of its CenterCore product line and determined that goodwill was impaired. As a result, the
Company incurred a $1,882,000 charge during the current year to write off all of the goodwill
related to its CenterCore operations. Other long-lived assets related to the CenterCore operations
include approximately $305,000 net book value of machinery and equipment. The Company
believes it can recover at least the net book value of these assets in a sale or alternatively recover
the cost of these assets in producing and selling other product lines. In addition to long-lived
assets, the Company has approximately $12 million in accounts receivable and $11 million in
inventory as of March 31, 2001 related to its CenterCore business. The Company currently
believes it can recover at least the book value of such assets though ongoing collection efforts,
satisfying incoming orders and/or selling these assets to a potential buyer. Sales for the
CenterCore business for the twelve months ended March 31, 2001 were approximately $54
million. Comprehensive Income
In accordance with SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, the Company
comprehensive income consists of foreign currency adjustments and unrealized holding gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities. For the year ended March 31, 2001, net income exceeded
comprehensive income by $199,000. Of this amount, $2,000 was related to a holding gain on
available-for-sale securities and $201,000 was related to foreign currency loss adjustments. For
the year ended March 31, 2000, comprehensive income exceeded net income by $80,000. Of this
amount, $5,000 was related to a holding loss on available-for-sale securities and $85,000 was
related to foreign currency gains. For the year ended March 31, 1999, comprehensive income
exceeded net income by $55,000. Of this amount, $5,000 was related to a holding gain on
available-for-sale securities, and $50,000 was related to foreign currency gains. Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2000 and 1999 balances to be consistent with the
2001 presentation. 38 2. Inventories Inventories consisted of the following March 31  2001

payment of certain closing and due diligence costs totaling $118,000. Until April 1, 2000, when the Company acquired the remaining 501 percent, MITY Enterprises
utilized the equity method of accounting for its investment. Under the equity method, MITY
Enterprises recognized its proportionate share of the earnings of DO Group as incurred. For the
year ended March 31, 2000 and 1999, DO Group contributed $368,000 and $480,000,
respectively, to MITY Enterprises' pretax profit. As part of the initial acquisition, MITY Enterprises loaned $1,000,000 in a senior subordinated
note to a wholly-owned subsidiary of DO Group. As of March 31, 2000, the outstanding balance
of the note had increased to $1,052,000 and was included in note receivable from affiliate. The
note, which was subordinated to a financial institution interest, was secured by inventories,
receivables, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, real property, and all other assets of
DO Group. The note matured on April 30, 2000 and bore interest at 10 percent payable
quarterly. The Company believes the interest rate approximated the market rate of interest for
similar debt instruments negotiated at arms length. 5. Recent Acquisitions On April 1, 2000, MITY Enterprises acquired the remaining 501 percent interest in the DO
Group, Inc., a privately-held manufacturer of office seating and office panel systems
headquartered in Elkhart, Indiana.  DO Group markets its products under the Domore, DO3, JG
and Corel trade names. MITY Enterprises exchanged $2,127,000 in cash and 40,905 shares of MITY Enterprises
common stock valued at $678,000 for the remaining 501 percent of DO Group stock from the
DO Group shareholders.  In addition, MITY Enterprise assumed approximately $1,000,000 in
long term debt and another $2,510,000 in a revolving credit line.  The acquisition was treated for
accounting purposes as a step purchase.  DO Group, Inc. is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of
MITY Enterprises, Inc.  Cash from the Company general working capital was used to fund the
purchase. On April 1, 2000, the Company also created a new corporation called MLI Acquisition, Inc.
With the exception of cash, real property, certain deferred tax obligations, and investments in and
notes receivable from subsidiaries, all of the assets and liabilities of MITY Enterprises, Inc. were
transferred to MLI Acquisition, Inc. MLI Acquisition, Inc. has become the operating company
for the multipurpose furniture operations and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. MLI
Acquisition, Inc. has since been renamed Mity-Lite, Inc. On April 9, 1999, the Company acquired certain assets and obligations of The CenterCore Group,
Inc., a privately-owned designer, manufacturer and marketer of call center furniture. Two wholly-owned subsidiaries of MITY Enterprises completed the transactions.  C Core, Inc., a
Utah corporation, purchased the accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment,
intellectual property and certain other assets of The CenterCore Group, Inc. for approximately
$5,342,000. C Core will continue to design and market call center furniture under the
CenterCore name.  In July 2000, product manufacturing was transitioned to DO Group, Inc.,
which was then a 499 percent-owned affiliate of the Company.  During the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2000, C Core purchased finished goods from DO Group, Inc. at an agreed upon
percentage in excess of cost at the time of shipment to the customer. Effective April 1, 2000, DO
Group became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 40 BOCCC, Inc., also a Utah corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, purchased
the outstanding subordinated debt obligations of CenterCore for $500,000.  The outstanding
subordinated debt obligations of CenterCore totaled approximately $2,000,000 at closing.  Cash
from the Company general working capital was used to fund the purchases. The allocation of
the purchase price resulted in approximately $2,063,000 of goodwill. Effective November 1, 1998, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding stock of
Broda Enterprises Inc., a privately-owned designer, manufacturer and marketer of healthcare
seating and seating accessories based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. The transaction was treated
for accounting purposes as a purchase and accordingly, the Company has included the operating
results operations of Broda in the financial statements from November 1, 1998. In conjunction with this acquisition, the Company paid $2,099,000 in cash with $130,000 being
held in escrow for one year to offset the effect of any breaches of representations, warranties or
covenants made by the sellers. The acquisition resulted in goodwill of $1,162,000. The unaudited pro forma results of operations of the Company for the year ended March 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 assuming the acquisition of Broda, CenterCore and DO Group had
occurred as of April 1, 1998 are as follows Fiscal Year Ended March 31, unaudited

with interest at the bank base rate 800 percent at March 31, 2001. No balances were
outstanding on this line as of March 31, 2001 and 2000. The Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Broda Enterprises had a line of credit, bearing interest
at Canadian prime 683 percent at March 31, 2001 which is secured by a General Security
Agreement, an assignment of insurance and guarantees by MITY Enterprises. The limit on this
loan is $650,000. At March 31, 2001, no balance was outstanding. Among other restrictions, both credit facilities require the maintenance of certain financial ratios
and levels of working capital. As of March 31, 2001, the Company was in full compliance with
the loan covenants related to the Broda Enterprises credit facility. However, the Company did
not meet the minimum quarterly net income required in the unsecured line of credit. The
Company has obtained a waiver of this requirement from the bank. 41 7. Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consisted of the following March 31  2001

free interest rates of 553 percent, 618 percent and 487 percent, and expected lives of one to
four years. Under SFAS No. 123, the weighted average fair value per share of options issued
during the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $275, $437, and $405, respectively. 43 9. Employee Benefit Plans In January 1995, the Company established a defined contribution plan which qualifies under
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan provides retirement benefits for
employees meeting minimum age and service requirements. Participants may contribute up to 20
percent of their gross wages, subject to certain limitations. The plan provides for discretionary
matching contributions by the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors. The
discretionary amounts contributed to the plan for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999
were $87,000, $75,000, and $42,000, respectively. In October 1996, the Board of Directors reserved up to 37,500 shares of MITY Enterprises
common stock to be issued under the provisions of the 401k plan. An additional 50,000 shares
of common stock were reserved in January 2000. Shares are issued to the plan on a quarterly
basis. The number of shares issued to the plan for the years ended March 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999 were 26,765, 12,198, and 6,060 respectively. As of March 31, 2001, 55,105 shares had
been issued under the provisions of the plan. Substantially all of the Arkansas union shop employees are covered under a multi-employer
pension plan. The current contribution rate is 225 cents for each hour compensated. Pension

Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, an amendment of
FASB Statement No. 133 which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and hedging activities and requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair
value. SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
supersedes SFAS No. 80, Accounting for Future Contracts, SFAS No. 105, Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments
with Concentration of Credit Risk, and SFAS No. 119, Disclosure about Derivative Financial
Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and also amends certain aspects of other
SFASs previously issued.  SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS No. 137, is effective for all
quarterly and annual financial statements of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The
adoption of SFAS 137 on April 1, 2001 did not have a significant impact on the Company. 47 In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 101 provides
guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues in
financial statements. The Company adopted SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The
impact of adopting SAB 101 on the Company results of operations and financial position was
not material. 14. Stock Split In August 1999, the Company board of directors approved a 3-for-2 stock split to be effected as
a stock dividend.  One additional share of common stock was distributed on September 23, 1999
for every two shares held by stockholders of record as of September 9, 1999.  Fractional shares
created as a result of the stock split were paid in cash based upon the average of the bid and ask
price per share at the close of trading on September 9, 1999.  The effect of the stock split has
been retroactively reflected in all common shares and per share amounts in the financial
statements and notes as if the stock split had occurred prior to fiscal 1999. 15.

Retroactively restated for the 3-for-2 stock split distributed September 23, 1999. The Company operating results for fiscal 2001 were adversely affected by its CenterCore and
DO Group subsidiaries, especially as it relates to their office systems operations located in
Marked Tree, Arkansas. These operations have experienced various challenges including, but not
limited to material, labor and overhead cost increases related to outsourcing of component
fabrication, increasing obsolescence reserves, increasing customer services costs, operational
inefficiencies, lower sales volumes, and higher personnel costs resulting from these operational
difficulties. In addition, the operation management information systems where not adequately
implemented to fully support the operations when the Company acquired the business on April 1,
2000. Since acquiring and taking over the direct management of DO Group, the Company has worked
to identify and resolve operational and other problems. The Company has taken action to reduce
the amount of losses being incurred at DO Group by reducing personnel costs through layoffs and
implementing more sound business practices. The Company has devoted additional management
as well as outside consulting resources to the resolution of these problems. The changes and
improvements being made in the DO Group and CenterCore subsidiaries are ongoing and will
likely continue for at least the next several months or until product lines are sold. In December
2000, the Company announced it was seeking a buyer for the CenterCore product line and as a
result recorded a $1,882,000 goodwill impairment charge during the quarter ended December 31,
2000 see Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In
February 2001, the Company announced that it had retained McDonald Investments, Inc. to
investigate strategic alternatives for the Company, including the sale of all or parts of the
Company. With the assistance of McDonald Investments, the Company continues to evaluate the
possible sale of all or parts of the Company, including CenterCore and DO Group. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recognized approximately $915,000 of
pretax charges related to inventory which the Company determined to be slow moving and/or
obsolete. This determination was made as a result of product line reduction decisions and
anticipated future shipment estimates made during the quarter. Approximately half of the charge
was related to the Company specialty seating operations located in Elkhart, Indiana. The other
half was related to the Company CenterCore operations located in Marked Tree, Arkansas. 49 Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders
No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2001. 14
