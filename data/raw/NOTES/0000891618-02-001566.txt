Item8.Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Shareholders Aradigm Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Aradigm Corporation as of December31, 2001 and 2000,
and the related statements of operations, redeemable convertible
preferred stock and shareholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Aradigm Corporation at December31, 2001 and
2000, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo Alto, California February15, 2002 38 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION BALANCE SHEETS In thousands, except shares data December 31 2001 2000 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 69,965 20,732 Short-term investments 1,199 23,649 Receivables 1,349 70 Current portion of notes receivable from officers

Significant Accounting Policies Organization
and Basis of Presentation Aradigm Corporation the Company is
a California corporation engaged in the development and
commercialization of non-invasive pulmonary drug delivery
systems. The Company does not anticipate receiving significant
revenue from the sale of products in the upcoming year.
Principal activities to date have included obtaining financing,
recruiting management and technical personnel, securing
operating facilities, conducting research and development, and
expanding commercial production capabilities. These factors
indicate that the Companys ability to continue its
research, development and commercialization activities are
dependent upon the ability of management to obtain additional
financing as required. Use of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. These estimates include useful lives for
property and equipment and related depreciation calculations,
estimated amortization period for payments received from product
development and license agreements as they relate to the revenue
recognition of deferred revenue and assumptions for valuing
options, warrants and deemed dividend. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. Cash
Equivalents and Investments The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and
cash equivalents in money market funds, commercial paper and
corporate notes. The Companys short-term investments
consist of commercial paper and corporate notes with maturities
ranging from three to twelve months. The Company classifies its investments as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale investments are recorded
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as other
comprehensive income loss in a separate component of the
statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and
shareholders equity until realized. Fair values of
investments are based on quoted market prices, where available.
Realized gains and losses, which have been immaterial to date,
are included in interest and other income and are derived using
the specific identification method for determining the cost of
investments sold. Dividend and interest income is recognized
when earned. Depreciation
and Amortization The Company records property and equipment at
cost and calculates depreciation using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the
term of the lease or useful life of the improvement. The
estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows Machinery and equipment 5 to 7 years Furniture and fixtures 5 to 7 years Lab equipment 5 to 7 years Computer equipment and software 3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements 5 to 17 years Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying
amount of property and equipment may not be recoverable under
the provisions of Statement of 43 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Financial Accounting Standards No121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long
Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. If it is determined that an
impairment loss has occurred based on expected future cash
flows, the loss is recognized on the Statements of Operations. Revenue
Recognition Contract revenues consist of revenue from
collaboration agreements and feasibility studies. The Company
recognizes revenue under the agreements as costs are incurred.
Deferred revenue represents the portion of all refundable and
nonrefundable research payments received that have not been
earned. In accordance with contract terms, milestone payments
from collaborative research agreements are considered
reimbursements for costs incurred under the agreements and,
accordingly, are generally recognized as revenue either upon the
completion of the milestone effort when payments are contingent
upon completion of the effort or are based on actual efforts
expended over the remaining term of the agreements when payments
precede the required efforts. Costs of contract revenues
approximate such revenue and are included in research and
development expenses. Refundable development and license fee
payments are deferred until the specified performance criteria
are achieved. Refundable development and license fee payments
are generally not refundable once the specific performance
criteria are achieved. Research and
Development Research and development expenses consist of
costs incurred for company-sponsored, collaborative and
contracted research and development activities. These costs
include direct and research-related overhead expenses. Research
and development expenses under collaborative and government
grants approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements.
The Company expenses research and development costs as such
costs are incurred. Stock Based
Compensation The Company has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees APB25, and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options.
This election was made because the alternative fair value
accounting provided for under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS123, requires the use of option
valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing
employee stock options. The Company accounts for options and warrants
issued to nonemployees under SFAS123 and Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No96-18. The value of options and
warrants are periodically remeasured over their vesting terms. Income
Taxes The Company uses the liability method to account
for income taxes as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect
the net tax effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Net Loss Per
Share Historical net loss per share has been calculated
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128,
Earnings Per Share. Basic net loss per share on a
historical basis is computed using the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding less the weighted average
number of shares subject to repurchase. In the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the weighted average
number of shares subject to repurchase were zero, zero and
48,000, respectively. No diluted loss per share information has
been 44 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued presented in the accompanying statements of
operations since potential common shares from stock options,
warrants and redeemable convertible preferred stocks are
antidilutive. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, the total number of shares excluded from diluted loss
per share relating to these securities was 10,038,525, 2,232,633
and 899,319 shares, respectively. Employee
Benefit Plans The Company has a 401k Plan which stipulates
that all full-time employees with at least three months of
employment can elect to contribute to the 401k Plan, subject
to certain limitations, up to 20% of salary on a pretax basis.
The Companys option to provide matching contributions had
not been done to date. During December 2000, the Company
approved a change to the employment qualification period from
three months to one month of employment and approved an employer
match program that became effective during 2001. Subject to a
maximum dollar match contribution, the Company will match 50% of
the first 6% of the employees contribution on a pretax
basis, but not to exceed $5,250 per year. During 2001, the
Company expensed total employer matching contributions of
$273,000. Significant
Concentrations Although the Company has had development
arrangements with other collaborative partners, the arrangement
with Novo Nordisk is our only active, funded development
agreement. For the year ended December31, 2001, this
partner-funded program contributed approximately 90% of total
contract revenues. The agreement with Novo Nordisk can be
terminated under certain conditions, including by either party
on limited written notice, by Novo Nordisk by limited prior
written notice upon the occurrence of certain events, and by
either party upon 30days written notice in the event
that the other party commits a material breach under the
agreement and fails to remedy such breach within
60days notice of such breach. Comprehensive
Income Loss Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
SFAS130, requires unrealized gains or losses on the
Companys available-for-sales securities to be recorded in
other comprehensive income loss. Total comprehensive loss has
been disclosed in the statement of redeemable convertible
preferred stock and shareholders equity. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statements of Financial StandardsSFAS
No141, Business Combinations, and SFAS
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The new rules require business combinations initiated after
June30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting and goodwill acquired after this date will no
longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment
tests. All other intangible assets will continue to be amortized
over their estimated useful lives. Companies are required to
adopt SFAS No142 for fiscal years beginning after
December31, 2001. The Company did not complete any
business combinations through the twelve months ended
December31, 2001, as a result these standards did not have
a material impact on its financial position or operating results. In August 2001, the FASB issued FASB Statement
No144 FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-lived Assets. FAS144 supercedes
FASB Statement No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-lived Assets and for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed of,
and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion
No30, Reporting the Results of Operations
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business,
and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business as
previously defined in that Opinion. This Statement also amends
ARB No51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to eliminate
the exception to 45 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued consolidation of a subsidiary for which control
is likely to be temporary. Companies are required to adopt
FAS144 for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, but early
adoption is encouraged. The Company has not yet determined the
impact this standard will have on its financial position and
results of operations, although it does not anticipate that the
adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the
Companys financial position or results of operations. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts
have been made to conform with current year presentation. 2.Financial

available-for-sale securities was $15,000 and $25,000 for 2001
and 2000, respectively. As of December31, 2001, the
average portfolio duration was approximately nine days, and the
contractual maturity of any single investment did not exceed
46days from the balance sheet date. 46 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

equipment include assets under capitalized leases of
approximately $13,080,000 and $13,675,000, respectively.
Accumulated depreciation related to leased assets at
December31, 2001 and 2000, was approximately $7,864,000
and $5,209,000, respectively. 4.Leases and
Commitments Amounts borrowed under the Companys
equipment lease lines of credit bear interest at rates from 98%
to 146% and are collateralized by the related equipment. Under
the terms of the lease agreements, the Company has the option to
purchase the leased equipment at a negotiated price at the end
of each lease term. In March 2001, the Company amended its
warehouse facility lease to reduce the leased space by 36,640
square feet. The Company leases its office, laboratory and
manufacturing facilities under several operating leases expiring
through the year 2016. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable
operating and capital leases at December31, 2001 are as
follows amounts in thousands Operating Capital Leases Leases Years ending December31 2002 4,925 4,006 2003 5,081 2,067 2004 5,241 513 2005 5,403 2006 and thereafter 45,887 Total minimum lease payments 66,537 6,586 Less amount representing interest 633 Present value of future lease payments 5,953 Current portion of capital lease obligations 3,526 Noncurrent portion of capital lease obligations 2,427 47 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Certain of the Companys operating leases
have rent escalation clauses and accordingly, the Company
recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis. At
December31, 2001, the Company had $300,000 deferred rent
expense, which is included in capital lease obligations on the
balance sheet. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, rent expense under operating leases totaled
$5,476,000, $3,896,000 and $2,449,000, respectively. 5.Contingencies In June 1998, Eli Lilly and Company
Lilly filed a complaint against the Company in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana. The complaint made various allegations against the
Company, arising from the Companys decision to enter into
an exclusive collaboration with Novo Nordisk with respect to the
development and commercialization of a pulmonary delivery system
for insulin and insulin analogs. The Company has sponsored
various studies of the pulmonary delivery of insulin and insulin
analogs using materials supplied by Lilly under a series of
agreements dating from January 1996. The Company and Lilly had
also conducted negotiations concerning a long-term supply
agreement under which Lilly would supply bulk insulin to the
Company for commercialization in the Companys AERx insulin
Diabetes Management System, and a separate agreement under which
the Company would license certain intellectual property to
Lilly. These negotiations were terminated after the Company
proceeded with its agreement with Novo Nordisk. The complaint
sought a declaration that Lilly scientists were co-inventors of
a patent application filed by the Company relating to pulmonary
delivery of an insulin analog or, in the alternative,
enforcement of an alleged agreement to grant Lilly a
nonexclusive license under such patent application. The
complaint also contained allegations of misappropriation of
trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion and unjust
enrichment and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief.
The Company filed an answer denying all material allegations of
the complaint and a motion for summary judgment directed against
all claims in Lillys complaint. The Court has issued two
written rulings on the Companys motion substantially
limiting the claims against the Company. Specifically, the Court
granted the Companys motion as to Lillys claim to
enforce an alleged license agreement, for misappropriation of
trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, estoppel
and breach of contract in part and dismissed those claims from
the case. The Court denied the Companys motion as to
Lillys claims for declaratory relief, unjust enrichment
and breach of contract in part, based on factual disputes
between the parties, and those issues remain to be resolved. The
Company recently filed a motion asking the Court to reconsider
summary judgment on the inventorship and unjust enrichment
claims, based on evidence recently produced by Lilly; the Court
denied the Companys motion, but the Company may raise
those issues again. Lilly filed a motion seeking to add several
new patents to the case; Lilly withdrew that motion after the
Company filled its opposition papers and after discussion with
the Court. Trial was set for November 2001, but has been
continued to April22, 2002 due to a conflict on the
Courts calendar. The risks to the Company should Lilly
prevail in this case are that Lilly would be given rights of an
owner, along with the Company, on one of the Companys
patents relating to pulmonary delivery of monomeric insulin
lispro and/or that Lilly would be awarded damages on its
remaining claims for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.
Lilly also contends that factual findings made in any trial of
this case would have some effect on other patents relating to
pulmonary delivery of monomeric insulin lispro. Management
believes that it has meritorious defenses against each of Eli
Lillys remaining claims and that this litigation will not
have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there
can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this case. 6.Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Stock Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Stock and Common Stock
Warrants During December 2001, the Company completed a
$484million SeriesA redeemable convertible
preferred stock preferred stock financing. Under
the terms of the financing, the Company sold to a group 48 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued of investors 2,001,236 shares of preferred stock
at a purchase price of $2420 per share. Each share of preferred
stock is convertible into four shares of common stock. The
Company also issued warrants to the investors to purchase
5,203,212 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $697
per share. Issuance costs of approximately $30million
were accounted for as a reduction to proceeds from the preferred
stock financing. During the first two years, the preferred stock
is entitled to cumulative dividends, which shall accrue at an
annual rate of 6%, payable only when and if declared by the
Board of Directors. At the option of the Company, dividends may
be paid in either cash or in shares of common stock, which will
be valued at a price equal to the then current market price. The
current market price of the common stock on any dividend payment
date shall be based on the closing price of the Companys
common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market. There were no
dividends declared as of December31, 2001. Each share of preferred stock, together with
accrued and unpaid dividends, is convertible, at the option of
the holder, into four shares of common stock. The conversion
rate is fixed and not subject to any adjustments except for
stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations,
mergers or other similar events. Each share of outstanding
preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock
upon either the closing of a registered underwritten public
offering covering the offer and sale of common stock with gross
proceeds to the Company exceeding $25million or the date
on which the common stock closing bid price has been above
$1059 per share for at least twenty consecutive trading days. Upon any liquidation, dissolution, redemption or
winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the
holders of outstanding preferred stock will be entitled to a
liquidation preference, equal to the original issue price plus
all accrued and unpaid dividends as adjusted for any stock
dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and other
similar events to the preferred holders. Any remaining assets
will be available for distribution to holders of common stock. Each holder of preferred stock shall have a
number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of such holders shares of
preferred stock and shall have voting rights and powers equal to
the voting rights and powers of the Companys common stock. Summary of
Preferred Stock and Warrant Accounting The net proceeds of the preferred stock offering
were reduced by approximately $147million, representing
the value assigned to the common stock warrants issued with the
preferred stock. The warrants were valued using the Black
Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
estimated volatility of 87%, risk-free interest rate of 471 no dividend yield, and an expected life of 5years. After
reducing the $484million proceeds by the value of the
warrants, the remaining proceeds were used to compute a
discounted conversion price in accordance with EITF00-27,
Application of EITF Issue No98-5, Accounting for
Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or
Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios to Certain Convertible
Instruments. The discounted conversion price is compared
to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on
the issuance date of the preferred stock resulting in a
beneficial conversion feature of approximately
$107million, which represents the difference between the
fair market value of the Companys common stock and the
discounted conversion price. The value of the beneficial
conversion feature is reported on the Statements of Operations
as a deemed dividend and is included in the calculation of net
loss applicable to the common shareholders. In July 2001, the SEC staff made a staff
announcement, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable
Securities, EITFD-98 which clarifies
Rule5-0228 of RegulationS-X, which was previously
adopted in accounting series Release No268,
Presentation in Financial Statements of Redeemable
Preferred Stock. This announcement addresses financial
statement classification and measurement of securities subject
to mandatory redemption requirements or whose redemption is
outside of the control of the issuer. Rule5-0228 requires
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other
assets to be classified outside of permanent 49 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued equity if they are redeemable 1at a fixed
or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date
2at the option of the holder, or 3upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of
the issuer. The preferred stock agreement provides that a
mandatory redemption is triggered if a change in control occurs.
Accordingly the Company has classified the preferred stock
outside of permanent equity. 7.Shareholders
Equity In January 2001, the Company raised
$5million through the sale of 339,961 common shares at a

the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals has
committed to purchase up to $45million of the
Companys common stock, in which the initial shares of
$20million initial purchase price was
purchased ten business days after the effective date of the
agreement. The number of initial shares was calculated by
dividing the initial purchase price by the greater of
athe average of the closing prices of the Companys
common stock on the Nasdaq for the thirty trading days
immediately prior to the effective date, and bthe
average of such closing prices for the five trading days
immediately prior to the effective date. In addition, the
Company may elect to sell at its option, subject to certain
conditions, between $5million and $10million of
additional shares to Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals once every
three months beginning December1, 2001 until the aggregate
amount of $25million has been reached. The number of
additional shares shall be calculated by dividing the additional
purchase price by the average closing price of the
Companys common stock on the Nasdaq for the thirty trading
days immediately prior to the date of written notice by the
Company to Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals. Novo Nordisk
Pharmaceuticals will hold the shares to be purchased under the
agreement for at least two years from the effective date of each
purchase, subject to certain conditions including, among other
things, Novo Nordisk not owning more than 45% of the
Companys common stock and the accuracy of certain
representations. During October 2001, the Company raised

conditions, has committed to purchase up to $50million of
the Companys common stock over a period not to exceed
20months, at a discount to a 20-day weighted average
trading price ranging from 5% to 7%. The amount that the Company
may draw down for any draw down pricing period is dependent upon
a number of factors, including the Companys stock price,
trading volume and threshold price set during the draw down
pricing period. The Company has filed a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in November 2000
related to the common stock available for sale under the equity
agreement. During December 2000, the Company raised

Options granted under the Directors Plan expire no later
than ten years from date of grant. The option price shall be at
100% of the fair value on the date of grant as determined by the
Board of Directors. The options generally vest quarterly over a
period of one year. During 2000, the Board of Directors approved
the termination of the Directors Plan. No more options can
be granted under the plan after its termination. The termination
of the Directors Plan will have no effect on the options
already outstanding. The following is a summary of activity under the

Incentive Plan In April 1996, the Companys Board of
Directors adopted and the Companys shareholders approved
the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan the Plan, which
amended and restated the 1992 Stock Option Plan. Options granted
under the Plan may be either incentive or non-statutory stock
options. As of December31, 2001, the Company had 5,953,312
shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Plan.
Options granted under the Plan expire no later than ten years
from the date of grant. For incentive and non-statutory stock
option grants, the option price shall be at least 100% and 85 respectively, of the fair value on the date of grant, as
determined by the Board of Directors. If at any time the Company

shall be at least 110% of the fair value and shall not be 52 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued exercisable more than five years after the date
of grant. During May 2001, the Companys shareholders
approved an amendment to the Plan to include an evergreen
provision. The evergreen provision will automatically increase
the number of shares reserved under the Plan, subject to certain
limitations, by 6% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of
the Company or such lessor number of shares as determined by the
Board of Directors on the date of the annual meeting of
shareholders of each fiscal year beginning 2001 and ending 2005.
The aggregate increase in the number of shares reserved under
the evergreen provision will not exceed 8,000,000 shares. Options granted under the 1996 Equity Incentive
Plan are immediately exercisable subject to repurchase
provisions, and the shares acquired generally vest over a period
of four years from the date of grant. The Plan also provides for
a transition from employee to consultant status without
termination of the vesting period as a result of such
transition. Under the Plan, employees may exercise options in
exchange for a note payable to the Company. As of
December31, 2001 and 2000, notes receivable from
shareholders were outstanding of zero dollars and $131,000,
respectively. These notes generally bear interest at 6% and are
due and payable in regular installments over a five-year period.
Any unvested stock issued is subject to repurchase agreements
whereby the Company has the option to repurchase unvested shares
upon termination of employment at the original issue price. The
common stock has voting rights but does not have resale rights
prior to vesting. The full amount of the notes receivable from
shareholders are secured by a pledge of shares of the
Companys common stock. The Company has repurchased a total
of 38,294 shares in accordance with these agreements. During
2001, the Company granted options to purchase 1,960,310 shares

Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation APB 25, which
requires use of option pricing valuation models that were not
developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB
25, the Company has generally recognized no compensation expense
with respect to such awards. The Company recorded deferred compensation of
approximately $704,000 for the difference between the grant
price and the fair value of certain of the Companys common
stock options granted in 1998. This amount is being amortized
over the vesting period of the individual options. There were no
such grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999. Amortization of deferred
compensation recognized in the years ended December31,
2001, 2000 and 1999 was approximately $162,000, $163,000 and
$162,000, respectively. The weighted average fair value of
options granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 with an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the Companys common stock
on the date of grant was $359, $1108 and $498, respectively. Pro forma information regarding net loss and
basic and diluted net loss per share is required by SFAS 123,
which also requires that the information be determined as if the
Company had accounted for its employee and non-employee director
stock options granted subsequent to December31, 1994 under
the fair value method prescribed by this statement. The fair
value of options was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: a risk-free interest rate of 42%, 62% and 52%
for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively; a dividend yield of 00%; the annual volatility
factor of the expected market price of the Companys common
stock for 2001, 2000 and 1999 are 870%, 780% and 641 respectively; and a weighted average expected option life of
four years. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the vesting period of the options using the straight-line
method. Pro forma information on the above basis is as follows

Stock Purchase Plan At the Annual Meeting of shareholders held in May
2001, the number of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the Purchase Plan increased by 250,000 shares
to 750,000 shares of common stock. Shares may be purchased under
the Purchase Plan at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value

December31, 2001 a total of 695,131 shares have been
issued under the Purchase Plan. 8.Collaborative
Agreements Novo
Nordisk In June 1998, the Company executed a development
and commercialization agreement with Novo Nordisk to jointly
develop a pulmonary delivery system for administering insulin by
inhalation. In addition, the agreement provides Novo Nordisk
with an option to develop the technology for delivery of other
compounds. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk has
been granted exclusive rights to worldwide sales and marketing
rights for any products developed under the terms of the
agreement. Through December31, 2001, the Company
received from Novo Nordisk approximately $683million in
product development and milestone payments and, of this amount,
the Company has recognized approximately $554million as
contract revenue. In future periods, the Company could receive
up to $120 million in additional product development and
nonrefundable milestone payments. In 1998, the Company raised
$50million through the sale of common stock to Novo
Nordisk at a 25% premium to the fair market price. In June 2001,
the Company raised an additional $5million through the
sale of common stock to Novo Nordisk at the fair market price.
In October 2001, the Company entered into a new common stock
purchase agreement with Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an
affiliate of Novo Nordisk A/ S. Under the new agreement, Novo
Nordisk Pharmaceuticals has committed to purchase up to
$45million of the Companys common stock. In October
2001, the Company entered into a common stock purchase agreement
with Novo Nordisk Pharmaceuticals, Inc., an affiliate of Novo
Nordisk A/ S. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk
Pharmaceuticals has committed to purchase up to $45million
of the Companys common stock, in which the initial shares
of $20million was purchased at fair market value. In
addition, the Company may elect to sell at its option, subject
to certain conditions including among other things, Novo Nordisk
not owning more than 45% of the Companys common stock and
the accuracy of certain representations, between $5million
and $10million of additional shares to Novo Nordisk
Pharmaceuticals once every three months beginning
December1, 2001 until the aggregate amount of
$25million has been reached. Novo Nordisk will fund all
product development costs incurred by the Company, while Novo
Nordisk and the Company will co-fund final development of the
AERx device. The Company will be the initial manufacturer of all
the products covered by the agreement and will receive a share
of the overall gross profits resulting from Novo Nordisks
sales of the products. For the years ended December31,
2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company recognized contract revenues of
$260million, $154million and $87million,
respectively. Glaxo
SmithKline The Company executed a development and
commercialization agreement with GlaxoSmithKline in September
1997. The agreement covered the use of the AERx Pain Management
System for the delivery of narcotic analgesics and the companies
intended to collaborate on the development of the products
within this field. Under the terms of the agreement,
GlaxoSmithKline was granted exclusive worldwide sales and
marketing rights to the AERx Pain Management System for use with
such analgesics, and the Company 55 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued retained all manufacturing rights. If the system
received regulatory approval, the Company intended to sell
devices and drug packets to GlaxoSmithKline and would receive
royalties on developed product sold by GlaxoSmithKline. During December 2000, the Company and
GlaxoSmithKline amended the product development and
commercialization agreement whereby the Company assumed full
control and responsibility for conducting and financing the
remainder of all development activities. Under the amendment,
unless GlaxoSmithKline or the Company terminate the agreement
for other reasons, GlaxoSmithKline can restore its rights and
obligations to participate in and fund development and
commercialization of product under the amended agreement upon
payment of a restoration fee to the Company. In the event
GlaxoSmithKline elects to restore its rights under the amended
agreement, revenue will be recognized for the portion of the
restoration fee that represents reimbursement of development
costs not previously reimbursed by GlaxoSmithKline, but incurred
by the Company through the date of the election. Any remaining
fees will be deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining
development period of the amended development agreement. The
Company anticipates that GlaxoSmithKline will review its
restoration election upon the delivery of Phase2b trial
results, which will be made available to them in the first half
of 2002, but there can be no assurance that GlaxoSmithKline will
elect to restore its rights. If the Company elects to terminate
the agreement and continues or intends to continue any
development activities, either alone or in collaboration with a
third party, then the Company is required to pay an exit fee to
GlaxoSmithKline. The payment of the exit fee would not have a
material impact on the Companys financial position or
operating results. Through December31, 2001, the Company had
received from GlaxoSmithKline and recognized as contract revenue
approximately $237million in product development and
milestone payments. No product development and milestone
payments were received during 2001. In 1997, the Company raised
$5million through the sale of common stock to
GlaxoSmithKline at a 25% premium to the fair market price. In
January 2001, the Company raised an additional $5million
through the sale of common stock to GlaxoSmithKline at the fair
market price. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, the Company recognized contract revenue of
$15million, $34million and $52million,
respectively. Genentech The Company entered into an agreement with
Genentech in May 1999. The agreement was to develop the drug
dornase alfa in the AERx system. Dornase alfa is the active
ingredient in the currently marketed Genentech product,
Pulmozyme. The agreement provided that development expenses
incurred by Aradigm would be reimbursed by Genentech in the form
of loans supported by promissory notes bearing interest at two
percent over the prime rate, which was 115% at
December31, 2000. Principal and unpaid accrued interest
was due at the earlier of 15days after FDA approval or
seven years after the effective date of the collaborative
agreement or May21, 2006. The Company would also receive
certain milestone payments at various points of product
development. In September 2000, the Company received a milestone
payment of $500,000 for the successful completion of a U.S.
Phase 2a clinical trial of the AERx Pulmonary Drug Delivery
System for the delivery of dornase alfa to patients with cystic
fibrosis. In February 2001, the Company announced that it
has mutually agreed with Genentech to discontinue the
development of dornase alfa using the Companys proprietary
AERx system. The companies also announced that they would be
entering into a new agreement allowing Genentech to evaluate
feasibility of using the AERx Pulmonary Drug Delivery System for
pulmonary delivery of other Genentech compounds. Under the terms
of the agreement, Genentech would not require the Company to
repay the loan of funds required to conduct product development
under the discontinued program. Forgiveness of the loan and
accrued interest resulted in an extraordinary gain during the
first quarter of 2001 of approximately $6,675,000. During 2001,
the Company refunded Genentech approximately $773,000 for
unspent project prepayments. 56 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for
tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys
deferred tax assets are as follows amounts in thousands December 31 2001 2000 Net operating loss carryforward 48,000 38,600 Deferred revenue 4,400 3,461 Research and development credits 6,500 3,980 Other 700 620 Total deferred tax assets 59,600 46,661 Valuation allowance 59,600 46,661 Net deferred tax assets Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are
uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been
fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance
increased by $12,939,000 and $17,033,000 during 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Deferred tax assets related to carryforwards at
December31, 2001 include approximately $1,600,000
associated with stock option activity for which any subsequently
recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to
stockholders equity. 57 Table of Contents ARADIGM CORPORATION NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
