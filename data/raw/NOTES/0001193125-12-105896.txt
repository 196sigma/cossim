The Board of Directors and Stockholders Carriage Services, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Carriage Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Carriage
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States, Carriage Services Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March9, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Company Carriage Services, Inc. Carriage, the Company, we, us, or our is a leading provider of death care services and merchandise in the United
States. As of December31, 2011, the Company owned and operated 159 funeral homes in 25 states and 33 cemeteries in 12 states. 
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Funeral and Cemetery Operations Carriage records the revenue from sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services when the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed. Sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as
revenue in accordance with the retail land sales provisions for accounting for sales of real estate. This method provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customers cumulative payments exceed 10% of the contract price
related to the interment right. Costs related to the sales of interment rights, which include real property and other costs related to cemetery development activities, are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period
in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue. Revenues to be recognized from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those
originated by the Company. Allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations are provided at the date that the sale is
recognized as revenue and are based on our historical experience and the current economic environment. We also monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted. When preneed sales of
funeral services and merchandise are funded through third-party insurance policies, we earn a commission on the sale of the policies. Insurance commissions are recognized as revenues at the point at which the commission is no longer subject to
refund, which is typically one year after the policy is issued. Accounts receivable included approximately $93 million and
$86 million of funeral receivables at December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and $73 million and $88 million of cemetery receivables at December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Non-current preneed receivables at December31,
2010 and 2011, represent the payments expected to be received beyond one year from the balance sheet date. Non-current preneed receivables consisted of approximately $88 million and $85 million of funeral receivables and $172 million and $160
million of cemetery receivables at December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively. For 2010 and 2011, accounts receivable also include minor amounts of other receivables. Preneed Contracts Carriage sells interment rights, merchandise and
services prior to the time of need, which is referred to as preneed. In many instances the customer pays for the preneed contract over a period of time. Cash proceeds from preneed sales less amounts that the Company may retain under state
regulations are deposited to a trust or used to purchase a third-party insurance policy. The principal and accumulated earnings of the trusts are generally withdrawn at maturity death or cancellation. The cumulative trust income earned and the
increases in insurance benefits on the insurance products are deferred until the service is performed. The customer receivables and amounts deposited in trusts that Carriage controls are primarily included in the non-current asset section of the
balance sheet. The preneed funeral contracts secured by third party insurance policies are not recorded as assets or liabilities of the Company. In the opinion of management, the proceeds from the trust funds and the insurance policies at the times the preneed contracts mature will exceed the estimated future costs to perform services and provide
products under such arrangements. The types of securities in which the trusts may invest are regulated by state agencies. Preneed Funeral
and Cemetery Trust Funds The Companys preneed and perpetual care trust funds are reported in accordance with the
principles of consolidating Variable Interest Entities VIEs. In the case of preneed trusts, the customers are the legal beneficiaries. In the case of perpetual care trusts, the Company does not have a right to access the corpus
in the perpetual care trusts. For these reasons, the Company has recognized financial interests of third parties in the trust funds in our financial statements as Deferred preneed funeral and cemetery receipts held in trust and Care
trusts corpus. The investments of such trust funds are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at market value; therefore, the unrealized gains and losses, as well as accumulated and undistributed income and realized gains and
losses, are recorded to Deferred preneed receipts held in trust and Care trusts corpus in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys future obligations to deliver merchandise and services are reported at
estimated settlement amounts. Preneed funeral and cemetery trust investments are reduced by the trust investment earnings that we have been allowed to withdraw in certain states prior to maturity. These earnings, along with preneed contract
collections not required to be placed in trust, are recorded in Deferred preneed funeral revenue and Deferred preneed cemetery revenue until the service is performed or the merchandise is delivered. 
41 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
In accordance with respective state laws, the Company is required to deposit a specified
amount into perpetual and memorial care trust funds for each interment/entombment right and certain memorials sold. Income from the trust funds is distributed to Carriage and used to provide for the care and maintenance of the cemeteries and
mausoleums. Such trust fund income is recognized as revenue when realized by the trust and distributable to the Company. The Company is restricted from withdrawing any of the principal balances of these funds. 
An enterprise is required to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprises variable interests give it a controlling
financial interest in a VIE.This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the
obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.The Companys analysis continues to support its
position as the primary beneficiary in the majority of our funeral and cemetery trust funds. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventory 
Inventory consists primarily of caskets, outer burial containers and cemetery monuments and markers and is recorded at the lower of its
cost basis determined by the specific identification method or net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The costs of ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred,
while renewals and betterments are capitalized. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed based on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: Years Buildings and improvements 15to40 Furniture and fixtures 7 to 10 Machinery and equipment 5 to 10 Automobiles 5 to 7
Property, plant and equipment was comprised of the following at December31, 2010 and 2011:

200,172 214,569 Less: accumulated depreciation 71,700 78,100 
128,472 136,469 
During 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Company recorded $7,517,000, $7,365,000 and $7,466,000 respectively, for
depreciation expense against operating income. Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased
intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. The long-lived assets to be held and used are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide
any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated cost to sell. 
42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and separate state income tax returns in the states in which we operate. We record deferred taxes for temporary
differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. Management reviews the
valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized. The Company analyzes tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and how they are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; provides certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters;
and specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has reviewed its income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions, primarily related to business acquisitions that
are not certain. Our policy with respect to potential penalties and interest is to record them as Other expense and Interest expense, respectively. The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect
the Companys effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. Stock Plans and Stock-Based Compensation The Company has stock-based
employee and director compensation plans in the form of restricted stock, performance units, stock options and an employee stock purchase plan. The Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share-based
awards over the period of vesting. Fair value is determined for restricted stock, stock options and the employee stock purchase plan on the date of the grant. The fair value of options or awards containing options is determined using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional
information on the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Computation of Earnings Per Common Share 
Basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of stock options. 
Share-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid,are recognized
as participating securities and included in the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share.Our grants of restricted stock awards to our employees and directors are considered participating securities and we have prepared our
earnings per share calculations to include outstanding unvested restricted stock awards in both the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation.For the three years ended December31, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the
calculations for basic and diluted earnings per share are presented in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December31, 2011. 
Fair Value Measurements 
We define fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually. We disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure
financial assets and liabilities, the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements, and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings, or changes in net assets, as of the measurement date. The fair
value disclosure transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 and the gross presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 reconciliation of the three-tier fair value hierarchy are also presented herein in Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company currently does not have any assets that have fair values determined by Level 3 inputs and no liabilities measured at fair value. We have not elected to measure any additional financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. To determine the fair value
of assets and liabilities in an environment where the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased, the exit price is used as the fair value measurement. For the year ended December31, 2011, we did not
incur significant decreases in the volume or level of activity of any asset or liability. The Company considers an impairment of debt and equity securities other-than-temporary unless athe Company has the intent to hold the investment and
bevidence indicate the cost of the investment is recoverable before the Company is more likely than not required to sell the investment. If impairment is indicated, then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount to fair value.
As of December31, 2011, no impairment was identified. 
43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued  1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued 
In the ordinary course of business, we are typically exposed to a variety of market
risks. Currently, these are primarily related to changes in fair market values related to outstanding debts and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts. Management is actively involved in monitoring
exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price. Our Senior Notes were issued to the public at par in January 2005 and are carried at a cost of
$130 million. At December31,2011, these securities were typically trading at a price of approximately $98, indicating a fair market value of approximately $1274 million. Our convertible junior subordinated debentures, payable to
Carriage Services Capital Trust the Trust pay interest at the fixed rate of 7% and are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at a cost of approximately $898 million. The fair value of these securities is estimated to be
approximately $787 million at December31,2011 based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the Trust. For more information regarding fair market valuations, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Business Combinations Tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and goodwill is recognized for any differences between the price of the acquisition and fair value. We customarily estimate related transaction costs known at closing. To the extent that information not
available to us at the closing date subsequently becomes available during the allocation period, we may adjust goodwill, assets, or liabilities associated with the acquisition. Acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition
and are expensed as incurred. During 2011, the Company acquired six funeral home businesses. See Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements herein for further information on the 2011 acquisitions. Goodwill 
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets of funeral homes and certain cemeteries acquired, as
determined by management in transactions accounted for as purchases, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily associated with or recorded in connection with the acquisitions of funeral businesses. Many of the acquired funeral homes have
provided high quality service to families for generations. The resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a funeral business. We review the carrying value of goodwill at least annually on reporting units aggregated
geographically to determine if facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that this intangible asset might be carried in excess of fair value. For 2009 and 2010 fair value was determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the
businesses in each reporting unit at the Companys weighted average cost of capital less debt allocable to the reporting unit and by reference to recent sales transactions of similar businesses. The calculation of fair value can vary
dramatically with changes in estimates of the number of future services performed, inflation in costs, and the Companys cost of capital, which is impacted by long-term interest rates. No impairment was indicated. 
We performed our 2011 annual impairment test of goodwill by conducting a qualitative assessment of each of our reporting units, East,
Central and West regional divisions in the United States, using information as of August31, 2011. See Part II, Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2, discussing new guidance on the methodology used for the annual
goodwill impairment test. Based on our 2011 impairment test, we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill. In
addition to our annual review, we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value.Factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include,
but are not limited to, significant adverse changes in the business climate which may be indicated by a decline in the Companys market capitalization or decline in operating results.The market capitalization of the Company consists of
the common stock, Senior Notes and convertible trust preferred securities.No such events or changes occurred between the testing date and year end to trigger a subsequent impairment review. 
Use of Estimates The
preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including
those related to revenue recognition, realization of accounts receivable, goodwill, intangible assets, property and equipment and deferred tax assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, third party data and assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses, the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities. Actual
results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change. Historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance, as there can be no assurance the margins,
operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be consistent from year to year.

recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements covered by this report. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on subsequent events.

Allowance for Credit Losses of Financing Receivables In July 2010, new guidance was issued which increased the disclosure requirements about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses.The intent of the disclosure
is to provide additional information about the nature of credit risks inherent in our financing receivables, how credit risk is analyzed and assessed when determining the allowance for credit losses, and the reasons for the change in the allowance
for credit losses.The disclosures related to period-end information were required for annual reporting periods ending after December15, 2010 and thus effective for the Company at December31, 2010.The disclosure of activity
that occurs during the reporting period are required for interim periods beginning after December15, 2010 and thus was effective for the Company for the period beginning January1, 2011.The additional required disclosures are
provided in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Goodwill Impairment Testing 
In September 2011, new guidance was issued to modify the method used to perform the first step of the two step process for the annual
goodwill impairment test. The guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether
it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. The guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September15, 2011, if an entitys financial statements for the most
recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued. The Company adopted this update early for its annual impairment testing as of August31,2011. Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations In December 2010, new
guidance was issued for disclosing supplementary pro forma information for business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. The guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the
entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The guidance also
expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and
earnings. This guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2010, and thus was effective for
the Company for the period beginning January1, 2011. The adoption of this accounting standard update will apply to material business combinations and did not have a material impact on our disclosures to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
2011 and the comparable prior periods. Fair Value Measurements 
In May2011, additional guidance was issued regarding how fair value measurements and disclosures should be applied where it is
already required or permitted under International Financial Reporting Standards or United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This new guidance clarifies and aligns the existing application of fair value measurement guidance and revises
certain language. This guidance is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December15, 2011, thus effective for the Company for the period beginning January1, 2012. The adoption of this accounting standard update
is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Comprehensive Income 
In June2011, new guidance was issued regarding the reporting of comprehensive income in the financial statements. Entities will have
the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This new guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its
components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity. This guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2011, thus effective
for the Company for the period beginning January1, 2012. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued  3. ACQUISITIONS 
Our growth strategy includes the execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model. The goal of that model is to build
concentrated groups of businesses in ten to fifteen strategic markets. We assess acquisition candidates using six strategic ranking criteria and to differentiate the price we are willing to pay. Those criteria are:  Size of business;  Size of market;  Competitive standing;  Demographics;  Strength of brand; and  Barriers to entry. Carriage completed six acquisitions of funeral home businesses in 2011. The consideration paid for these businesses was $186 million and the assumption of $06 million of liabilities. During the fourth
quarter of 2011, the Company completed two of the six acquisitions of funeral home businesses, one in Kentucky and the other in New York, for a total of $83 million. During 2010, the Company completed six acquisitions, one cemetery business and
five funeral home businesses for a total of $190 million in cash and the assumption of $06 million of liabilities and debt. The assets and liabilities for all acquisitions were recorded at fair value and included goodwill of $107 million and
$164 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. For all acquisitions, the Company acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain operating liabilities including obligations associated with existing preneed contracts. The proforma impact of
the acquisitions on the prior periods are not presented as the impact is not material to reported results. The results of the acquired businesses are included in the Companys results from the date of acquisition.

4. GOODWILL 
Many of the former owners and staff of acquired funeral homes and certain cemeteries have provided high quality service
to families for generations. The resulting loyalty often represents a substantial portion of the value of a business. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as determined by
management in business acquisition transactions accounted for as purchases, is recorded as goodwill.

Changes in previous estimates are related to minor adjustments to inventory. 
5. PRENEED TRUST INVESTMENTS 
Preneed Cemetery Trust Investments Preneed cemetery trust investments represent trust fund assets that the Company will generally withdraw when the merchandise or services are provided. Preneed cemetery trust investments are reduced by the
trust earnings the Company has been allowed to withdraw prior to performance by the Company pursuant to state laws. The components of preneed cemetery trust investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2010 and 2011 are as
follows in thousands:  December31,2010 December31,2011 Preneed cemetery trust investments 81,771 68,557 Less: allowance for contract cancellation 2,080 2,138 
79,691 66,419 
Upon cancellation of a preneed cemetery contract, a customer is generally entitled to receive a refund of
the corpus and some or all of the earnings held in trust. In certain jurisdictions, the Company is obligated to fund any shortfall if the amounts deposited by the customer exceed the funds in trust, including some or all investment income. As a
result, when realized or unrealized losses of a trust result in the trust being under-funded, the Company assesses whether it is responsible for replenishing the corpus of the trust, in which case a loss provision would be recorded. 
The cost and fair market values associated with preneed cemetery trust investments at December31, 2011 are detailed below in
thousands. The Company determines whether or not the assets in the preneed cemetery trusts have an other-than-temporary impairment on a security-by-security basis. This assessment is made based upon a number of criteria including the length of time
a security has been in a loss position, changes in market conditions and concerns related to the specific issuer. If a loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the security is adjusted downward to its fair market value. Any
reduction in the cost basis of the investment due to an other-than-temporary impairment is likewise recorded as a reduction in deferred preneed cemetery receipts held in trust. There will be no impact on earnings unless and until such time as the
investment is withdrawn from the trust in accordance with state regulations at an amount that is less than its original basis.

Preneed Funeral Trust Investments 
Preneed funeral trust investments represent trust fund assets that the Company expects to withdraw when the services and merchandise are
provided. Preneed funeral contracts are secured by funds paid by the customer to the Company. Preneed funeral trust investments are reduced by the trust earnings the Company has been allowed to withdraw prior to performance by the Company and
amounts received from customers that are not required to be deposited into trust, pursuant to various state laws. The components of preneed funeral trust investments in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2010 and 2011 were as

Preneed sales of cemetery interment rights, merchandise and services are usually financed through interest-bearing
installment sales contracts, generally with terms of up to five years with such interest earnings included in cemetery revenues. In substantially all cases, we receive an initial down payment at the time the contract is signed.The interest
rates generally range between 95% and 12%.Occasionally, we have offered zero percent interest financing to promote sales for limited-time offers.At December31, 2011, the balance of preneed receivables for cemetery interment rights
and for merchandise and services was $185 million and $91 million, respectively. 
50 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued  6. PRENEED CEMETERY RECEIVABLES continued 
The Company determines an allowance for customer cancellations and refunds on contracts
in which revenue has been recognized on sales of cemetery interment rights. We reserve 100% of the receivables on contracts in which the revenue has been recognized and payments are 120 days past due or more, which was approximately 23% of the
total receivables on recognized sales at December31, 2011.An allowance is recorded at the date that the contract is executed and periodically adjusted thereafter based upon actual collection experience at the business level.For the

insurance policies have been assigned to the Company and will be paid upon the death of the insured. The proceeds will be used to satisfy the beneficiarys obligations under the preneed contract for services and merchandise. Preneed funeral
contracts secured by insurance totaled $2050 million and $2160 million at December31, 2010 and 2011, respectively, and are not included in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date applicable for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We disclose the extent to which fair value is used to
measure financial assets and liabilities, the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements, and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings, or changes in net assets, as of the measurement date. 
The Company evaluated its financial assets and liabilities for those financial assets and liabilities that met the criteria of the
disclosure requirements and fair value framework. The Company identified investments in fixed income securities, common stock and mutual funds presented within the preneed and perpetual care trust investments categories on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets as having met such criteria. The following three-level valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs is
utilized in the measurement and valuation of financial assets or liabilities as of the measurement date:  Level 1Fair value of securities based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Our investments
classified as Level 1 securities include common stock, certain fixed income securities, and equity mutual funds;  Level 2Fair value of securities estimated based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation. These inputs include interest rates,
yield curves, credit risk, prepayment speeds, rating and tax-exempt status. Our investments classified as Level 2 securities include certain fixed income securities and fixed income mutual funds; and  Level 3Unobservable inputs based upon the reporting entitys internally developed assumptions, which market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. As of December31, 2011, the Company did not have any assets that had fair values determined by Level 3 inputs and no liabilities measured at fair value. 
The Company accounts for its investments as available-for-sale and measures them at fair value under standards of financial accounting
and reporting for investments in equity instruments that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities.

The following table summarizes the fair value on a recurring basis and summarizes the
fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by us to determine the fair values as of December31, 2011 in thousands. Certain fixed income and other securities are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs. For these
securities, the Company uses pricing services and dealer quotes. As of December31, 2011, the Company did not have any liabilities measured at fair value.  QuotedPricesinActive

CAPITAL TRUST 
Carriages wholly-owned subsidiary, Carriage Services Capital Trust, issued 1,875,000 units of 7% convertible
preferred securities TIDES during June 1999, resulting in approximately $900 million in net proceeds, and the Company issued a 7% convertible junior subordinated debenture to the Trust in the amount of $9375 million. The convertible preferred
securities have a liquidation amount of $50 per unit, and are convertible into Carriages common stock at the equivalent conversion price of $204375 per share of common stock. The subordinated debentures and the TIDES mature in 2029, and the
TIDES are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by the Company. Both the subordinated debentures and the TIDES contain a provision for the deferral of distributions for up to 20 consecutive quarters. During the period in which distribution payments are
deferred, distributions will continue to accumulate at the 7% annual rate. Also, the deferred distributions will themselves accumulate distributions at the annual rate of 7%. During the period in which distributions are deferred, Carriage is
prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock or repurchasing its common stock, with limited exceptions. There are no deferred distributions at December31, 2011. For the year ended December31, 2010, the Company repurchased 17,850 shares of these TIDES for approximately $06 million and recorded a gain of $03 million. In September 2010, the Company converted
these preferred shares at the current conversion rate of 24465 into shares of common stock equal to 43,670 shares. During the year ended December31, 2011, the Company repurchased 61,742 shares of these TIDES for approximately $2,241,000 and
recorded gains of $846,000. The Company converted these preferred shares at the conversion rate of 24465 into shares of common stock equal to 151,052 shares. Immediately upon the exchange, these common shares were cancelled. At December31,

paid $21 million, $19 million and $20 million to the contractor for services in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively. Litigation
We are a party to various litigation matters and proceedings. For each of our outstanding legal matters, we evaluate the
merits of the case, our exposure to the matter, possible legal or settlement strategies, and the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. We intend to defend ourselves in the lawsuits described herein. If we determine that an unfavorable outcome is
probable and can be reasonably estimated, we establish the necessary accruals. We hold certain insurance policies that may reduce cash outflows with respect to an adverse outcome of certain of these litigation matters. 
Leathermon, et al. v. Grandview Memorial Gardens, Inc., et al., United States District Court, Southern District of Indiana, Case
No4:07-cv-137.On August17, 2007, five plaintiffs filed a putative class action against the current and past owners of Grandview Cemetery in Madison, Indiana, including the Carriage subsidiaries that owned the cemetery from January
1997 until February 2001, on behalf of all individuals who purchased cemetery and burial goods and services at Grandview Cemetery.Plaintiffs claim that the cemetery owners performed burials negligently, breached Plaintiffs contracts, and
made misrepresentations regarding the cemetery. The Plaintiffs also allege that the claims occurred prior, during and after the Company owned the cemetery. On October15, 2007, the case was removed from

Jefferson County Circuit Court, Indiana to the Southern District of Indiana. On April24, 2009,
shortly before Defendants had been scheduled to file their briefs, in opposition to Plaintiffs motion for class certification, Plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add new class representatives and claims, while also seeking to abandon
other claims. The Company, as well as several other Defendants, opposed Plaintiffs motion to amend their complaint and add parties. In April 2009, two Defendants moved to disqualify Plaintiffs counsel from further representing Plaintiffs
in this action. On March31, 2010, the Court granted the Defendants motion to disqualify Plaintiffs counsel.In that order, the Court gave Plaintiffs 60 days within which to retain new counsel.On May6,2010,
Plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandamus with the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals seeking relief from the trial courts order of disqualification of counsel. On May19, 2010, the Defendants responded to the petition of mandamus.
On July8, 2010, the Seventh Circuit denied Plaintiffs petition for writ of mandamus. Thus, pursuant to the trial courts order, Plaintiffs were given 60 days from July8, 2010 in which to retain new counsel to prosecute this
action on their behalf. Plaintiffs retained new counsel and the trial court granted the newly retained Plaintiffs counsel 90 days to review the case and advise the Court whether or not Plaintiffs would seek leave to amend their complaint to
add and/or change the allegations as are currently stated therein and whether or not they would seek leave to amend the proposed class representatives for class certification. Plaintiffs moved for leave to amend both the class representatives and
the allegations stated within the complaint. Defendants filed oppositions to such amendments. The Court issued an order permitting the Plaintiffs to proceed with amending the class representatives and a portion of their claims; however, certain of
Plaintiffs claims have been dismissed. Discovery in this matter will now proceed. Carriage intends to defend this action vigorously.Because the lawsuit is in its preliminary stages, we are unable to evaluate the likelihood of an
unfavorable outcome to the Company or to estimate the amount or range of any potential loss, if any, at this time.

Total net deferred tax assets 3,568 7,030 
The current deferred tax asset is included in Inventories and other current assets at December31,
2010 and 2011. The non-current deferred tax asset is included in Deferred charges and other non-current assets at December31, 2010 and 2011. Carriage records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain. Management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and
makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized. The Company recognized a $02 million decrease in its valuation allowance during 2011. 
For federal income tax reporting purposes, Carriage utilized the remainder of its net operating loss carryforward during the current
year. For state reporting purposes, Carriage has approximately $457 million of net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between 2013 and 2030, if not utilized. Based on managements assessment of the various state net operating
losses, it was determined that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize tax benefits on a substantial amount of the state losses. The valuation allowance at December31,2011 is attributable to the deferred
tax asset related to the state operating losses. The Company analyzes tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and how they
are to be recognized, measured, and derecognized in financial statements; provides certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters; and specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Company has reviewed its income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions, primarily related to business acquisitions that are not certain. Our policy with respect to potential penalties and interest is to record them as Other
expense and Interest expense, respectively. The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in its
unrecognized tax benefits during the next year. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits for federal and state income tax
purposes totaling $79 million as of December31,2011, resulting from deductions totaling $209 million on federal returns and $202 million on various state returns. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards exceeding these
deductions, and has accounted for these unrecognized tax benefits by reducing the deferred income tax asset related to the net operating loss carryforwards by the amount of these unrecognized deductions. For federal and certain states without net
operating loss carryforwards, the Company has increased its taxes payable by deductions that are not considered more likely than not. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands  59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued  15.

The entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective
tax rate. The effects of recognizing the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions for the year ended December31, 2011 were not material to the Companys operations. The Company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in its
unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. The amount of penalty and interest recognized in the balance sheet and statement of operations was not material for the year ended December31,2011. 
The Companys Federal income tax returns for 2001 through 2010 are open tax years that may be examined by the Internal Revenue
Service. The Companys unrecognized state tax benefits are related to state returns open from 2001 through 2010.

options will vest in 331/3% increments over a three
year period and will expire on February28, 2021. The value of these stock options is approximately $05 million. The fair value of the option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 125%; expected dividend yield of 0% for each year; expected termination period of 337 years; expected lives of three years; and expected volatility of 6009%. During the third
quarter of 2011, 3,000 stock options were awarded to an employee. The value of these options was approximately $6,400. The stock options vest in
331/3% increments over a three year period and will
expire August10, 2021. The fair value of the option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 0625%, expected dividend
yield of 19% for each year; expected termination period of 346 years, expected lives of three years; and expected volatility of 5874%.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan Carriage provides all employees the opportunity to purchase common stock through payroll deductions. Purchases are made quarterly; the price being 85% of the lower of the price on the grant date or the
purchase date. In 2009, employees purchased a total of 219,262 shares at a weighted average price of $252 per share. In 2010, employees purchased a total of 106,880 shares at a weighted average price of $338 per share. In 2011, employees purchased

unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested restricted stock awards, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 16 years. Director Compensation Plans The Companys Director Compensation Plan
entitles the directors to be compensated in the form of quarterly retainers for service as a director, annual retainers for committee chair positions and fees for attending meetings. Effective March22,2010, and subsequently revised on
July14, 2010, the Board of Directors approved a new Director Compensation Policy in which the directors no longer have an option to elect to receive all or a portion of their fees in stock. Consequently, all retainers and meeting fees after
March22, 2010 have been paid in cash. Also, in accordance with this new policy, each independent director is entitled to a fully vested annual equity retainer equal to $40,000 of the Companys common stock. On May18,2011, the
Company issued 6,802 shares of common stock to each of the three independent directors for such retainer. One new director joined the Board of Directors during the second quarter of 2011, at which time he was granted 17,006 shares valued at
$100,000. A second new director joined the Board of Directors during the third quarter of 2011, at which time he was granted 19,193 shares valued at $100,000. For both new directors, one-half of those shares vested immediately; the remainder vest
over two years. On March5, 2012, the Board of Directors approved a new Director Compensation Policy which increased certain fees and retainers. Cash Dividends On May17, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the
initiation of a quarterly cash dividend policy for our common stock. The Board declared three quarterly dividends of $0025 per share, totaling approximately $14 million which were paid on June1, 2011, September1,2011 and
December1, 2011 respectively, to record holders of our common stock as of May17, 2011,August12, 2011 and November14,2011 respectively. The Company has a dividend reinvestment program so that stockholders may elect
to reinvest their dividends into additional shares of the Companys common stock. 
17. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM 
During November 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up
to $5 million of the Companys common stock. The repurchases are executed in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, normal trading restrictions and other relevant factors. During 2011, the

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
Managements Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed
in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and to ensure that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and
financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December31, 2011 the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. 
Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15f. Managements report on our
internal control over financial reporting is presented on the following page of this Annual Report on Form10-K. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this report, has
issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which is also presented in Item9A. 
70 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined under Rule13a-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 
ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and 
iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an
assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2011 using the framework specified in Internal Control Integrated Framework, published by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. 
The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, which also audited the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December31, 2011, as stated in their report which is presented in this Annual Report. s/ Melvin C. Payne

Carriage Services, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Carriage Services,
Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Carriage Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011, and our report dated March9, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
