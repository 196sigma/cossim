ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
ArQule, Inc. the Company is engaged in the discovery, development and
production of novel chemical compounds primarily for the pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and agrochemical industries. Its operations are focused on the
integration of combinatorial chemistry, structure-guided rational drug design
and other proprietary technologies which automate the process of chemical
synthesis to produce arrays of novel small organic chemical compounds used to
generate and optimize drug development candidates.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these
financial statements are as follows:
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased within three
months of maturity date to be cash equivalents. The Company invests its
available cash primarily in money market mutual funds and U.S. government and
other investment grade debt securities which have strong credit ratings. These
investments are subject to minimal credit and market risks. At December 31, 1996
and 1997, the Company has classified its investments as available-for-sale.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
At December 31, 1996 and 1997, the Company financial instruments consist
of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, notes
receivable from related party, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The
carrying amount of these instruments approximate their fair values.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Assets under capital
leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases by use of the
straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
Compound development revenue relates to revenue from significant
collaborative agreements Note 3 and from licensing of compound arrays. Revenue
from collaborative agreements relates to the delivery of compounds and to
compound development work and is recognized using the percentage of completion
method. The application of this revenue recognition method is dependent on the
contractual arrangement of either compound delivery or development. Accordingly,
revenue is recognized on the proportional achievement of deliveries against a
compound delivery schedule or as development labor is expended against a total
research and development labor plan. Payments received under these arrangements
prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from licensing of compound arrays with no additional obligations is
recognized upon delivery of the compound array. License option fees represent
payments made to the Company for a right to evaluate and negotiate the terms of
potential licensing arrangements and are recognized as revenue as the options
are granted, as the Company has no further obligations and as payments are
nonrefundable.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue represents the actual costs incurred in connection with
performance pursuant to collaborative agreements and the costs incurred to
produce compound arrays. These costs consist primarily of payroll and
payroll-related costs, chemicals, supplies and overhead expenses.

ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Net Income Loss per Share
During the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128. SFAS
No. 128 replaces primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and
diluted earnings per share. The adoption of this standard resulted in the
Company retroactive restatement of previously reported loss per share
calculations reflecting the removal of certain anti-dilutive pro forma share
amounts. For the year ended December 31, 1997, the dilutive effect of 1,057,000
weighted average common stock option equivalents were added to the basic
weighted average shares outstanding to arrive at diluted weighted average shares
outstanding.
Stock Compensation
Options granted to employees and directors are accounted for in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB No. 25. Under APB No. 25, no compensation expense is
recognized for options granted at fair market value. The Company has adopted the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation SFAS No. 123. Options granted to nonemployees are accounted
for using the fair value method and are recognized as compensation expense over
their respective service periods.
Inventories
Inventory consists of costs associated with the Company Mapping Array
libraries and is stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in, first-out basis, or
market. Such costs are capitalized after achieving technological feasibility.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 and 1996 financial
statements to conform to the 1997 presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on the net loss for 1995 and 1996.
3. SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
The Company has entered into a number of license, research and development
agreements the Agreements with seven corporate collaborators who accounted
for substantially all of the Company 1997 revenue. One Agreement was entered
into with Solvay Duphar B.V. Solvay, a related party Note 9. Revenue
related to the Solvay Agreement is included in compound development
revenue -- related party. Under the terms of these Agreements, the Company will
provide a certain number of compounds per year and has granted the right to
screen these compounds against targets to identify biological activity an
Active Compound and will provide research and development services. The
collaborators have the right to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license the
License for any Active Compound identified. The initial terms of these
Agreements generally range from two to five years during which period the
collaborators make payments to the Company for technology access, delivery of
compounds and for its research and development services. In exchange for a
License, the Company will receive milestone payments during product development
and royalty payments based on the sales of the product. Solvay exercised its
right to license certain of the Company technologies on a non-exclusive basis
in December 1997.

ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Additionally, the Company has entered into a number of agreements with
biotechnology companies the biotech collaborators. Under the terms of
material transfer agreements with biotech collaborators, the Company has granted
the biotech collaborator the nonexclusive, royalty-free license to test certain
compound arrays supplied by the Company. Upon identification of an active
compound, the Company will negotiate a joint drug development program with the
biotech collaborator to develop the compound, provided the Company has not
previously licensed the compound. Under the collaboration agreements with these
joint drug development programs, the Company and the biotech collaborator will

In October and November 1996, the Company completed its initial public
offering of 2,875,000 shares of common stock. Proceeds to the Company, net of
issuance costs, amounted to $31,521,000. In connection with its initial public
offering, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Company Certificate of
Incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares to 30,000,000.
On April 4, 1997, the Company completed a follow-on offering of 1,932,500
shares of Common Stock, which included the underwriters' exercise of their
over-allotment of 300,000 shares of Common Stock on April 14, 1997. Proceeds to
the Company, net of issuance costs, amounted to $21,545,000.
Stock Restriction Agreements
The Company has common stock issued pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan
which is subject to stock restriction agreements whereby the stockholder
automatically forfeits to the Company the unvested portion of shares of common
stock in the event of termination of their employment with the Company. All such
forfeited shares shall immediately be retired by the Company. Shares subject to
this agreement vest over a four year period. At December 31, 1996 and 1997, the
approximate number of unvested common shares is 96,500 and 13,500, respectively.
Each stock restriction agreement may be terminated at the election of the
Company.
11. EQUITY INCENTIVE AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS
During 1996, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1994 Amended and
Restated Equity Incentive Plan the Equity Incentive Plan increasing the
number of shares of common stock available for awards under the Equity Incentive
Plan to 2,600,000. All shares are awarded at the discretion of a Committee
31
33
ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
of the Board of Directors the Committee in a variety of stock-based forms
including stock options and restricted stock. Pursuant to the Equity Incentive
Plan, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than the fair market
value of the Company common stock at the date of the grant, and the option
term may not exceed ten years. For holders of 10% or more of the Company
voting stock, options may not be granted at less than 110% of the fair market
value of the common stock at the date of the grant, and the option term may not
exceed five years. Stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with an option
shall have an exercise price not less than the exercise price of the related
option. As of December 31, 1997, no stock appreciation rights have been issued.
Subject to the restrictions above, the Committee is authorized to designate
the options, awards, and purchases under the Equity Incentive Plan, the number
of shares covered by each option, award and purchase, and the related terms,
exercise dates, prices and methods of payment.
In 1996, the stockholders approved the 1996 Director Stock Option Plan the
1996 Director Plan for nonemployee directors. Under this plan, eligible
directors are automatically granted once a year, at the annual meeting of
stockholders of the Company, options to purchase 3,500 shares of common stock
which are exercisable on the date of grant. Upon initial election of an eligible
director, options to purchase 7,500 shares of common stock will be granted which
will become exercisable in three equal annual installments commencing on the
date of the Company next annual stockholders' meeting held after the date of
grant. All options granted pursuant to the 1996 Director Plan have a term of ten
years with exercise prices equal to fair market value on the date of grant.
Through December 31, 1997, options to purchase 33,000 shares of common stock
have been granted under this plan. A maximum of 125,000 shares of common stock
of the Company is reserved for issuance in accordance with the terms of this
plan, of which 92,000 are available for future grant.
The Company applies APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting
for employee grants under the Equity Incentive Plan and the 1996 Director Plan
collectively the Plans. No compensation expense has been recognized under
the Plans for employee grants. Had compensation cost been determined based on
the estimated value of options at the grant date consistent with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123, the Company pro forma net loss, pro forma basic net loss per
share and diluted net loss per share would have been as follows:
DECEMBER 31,
1995      1996      1997
Pro Forma net  $2,254,000  $3,186,000  $2,583,000
Pro Forma basic and diluted net loss per
376     131     023
During 1996 and 1997, the Company issued 117,500 and 69,000 options to
certain consultants and members of its Scientific Advisory Board SAB under the
Equity Incentive Plan. In April 1997, 11,000 shares were cancelled. The
estimated value of these options totaled $709,000 and $328,000 in 1996 and 1997,
respectively, was recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized as
compensation expense over the vesting period of the options. Compensation
expense in 1996 and 1997 was $63,000 and $420,000, respectively.
For the purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated value of each
employee and nonemployee option grant was calculated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no
dividend yield for both years; 45% volatility for 1996 and 50% volatility for
1997 for nonemployee grants and employee grants subsequent to the initial filing
of the Registration Statement in connection with the Company initial public
offering; no volatility for employee grants prior to the initial public
offering; risk-free interest rates of 52% to 71% in 1996 and 60% in 1997;
expected lives of 3 to 6 years in 1996 and 4 years in 1997 for options granted.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the use of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the corporation employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options,
32
34
ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimates, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock-based
compensation.

At December 31, 1997, there were 515,546 shares available for future grant
under the Equity Incentive Plan.
Stock Purchase Plan
In 1996, the stockholders adopted the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan. This plan enables eligible employees to exercise rights
to purchase the Company common stock at 85% of the fair
33
35
ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
market value of the stock on the date the right was granted or the date the
right is exercised, whichever is lower. Rights to purchase shares under the
Purchase Plan are granted by the Board of Directors. The rights are exercisable
during a period determined by the Board of Directors; however, in no event will
the period be longer than twenty-seven months. The Purchase Plan is available to
substantially all employees, subject to certain limitations. The Company has
reserved 120,000 shares of common stock for purchases under the Purchase Plan.
At December 31, 1997, 9,173 shares have been purchased pursuant to the Purchase
Plan.
12. INCOME TAXES
There is no current or deferred tax expense for the years ended December
31, 1995, 1996 and 1997.
The deferred tax consequences of temporary differences in reporting items
for financial statement and income tax purposes are recognized, if appropriate.
Realization of the future tax benefits related to the deferred tax assets is
dependent on many factors, including the company ability to generate taxable
income within the net operating loss carryforward period. Management has
considered these factors in reaching its conclusion as to the valuation
allowance for financial reporting purposes. The income tax effect of temporary
differences comprising the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on
the accompanying balance sheets is a result of the following:
DECEMBER 31,
1996      1997
Deferred tax assets:
Preoperating costs capitalized for tax purposes. $  370,000  $  288,000
Net operating loss   3,906,000   4,506,000
Tax credit    311,000    811,000
Non-employee equity based       --    173,000
30,000     40,000
$ 4,617,000  $ 5,818,000
Deferred tax liabilities:
Tax depreciation in excess of book.      --    135,000
Valuation   4,617,000  5,683,000
Net deferred tax  $    --  $                                      
The Company has provided a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax
assets as the realization of these future benefits is not sufficiently assured
as of the end of each related year. If the Company achieves profitability, the
deferred tax assets will be available to offset future income tax liabilities
and expense. Of the $57 million valuation allowances at December 31, 1997 615,000 relates to deductions for disqualifying dispositions and non qualified
stock options which will be credited to paid in capital, if realized.

The Company has available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$11,000,000 for tax purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating
loss carryforwards expire principally in 2009 to 2012. General tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $811,000 expire principally in 2009 to 2012.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial changes in the Company
ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards which can be utilized in future years.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCY
Leases
The Company leases facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating
and capital leases. The future minimum lease commitments under these leases are

is forty-two months, commencing on the purchase date of the asset, and the lease
bears interest at a rate determined by the Lessor at the transaction date.
Rent expense under noncancelable operating leases was approximately
$163,000, $283,000 and $582,000 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996, and
1997, respectively.

Contingency
On July 21, 1997, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court
of Connecticut against the Company and two of the Company stockholders by two
individuals alleging that they were entitled to compensation from the Company
and these two stockholders equal to approximately five percent of the equity
interests in the Company for services in connection with the initial financing
of ArQule Partners, L.P. in 1993. In addition, one of the plaintiffs is alleging
that he was denied the opportunity to make a five percent investment in the
Company at the time of its incorporation. Prior to the Company initial public
offering of its Common Stock, ArQule Partners, L.P. was a major stockholder of
the Company. An answer was filed on September 15, 1997 denying the material
allegations in the complaint and Phase I of the discovery process has been
completed. Although the parties to this lawsuit have had mediation proceedings,
the Company intends to continue to contest this lawsuit vigorously. No assurance
can be given regarding the outcome of this lawsuit. The Company is currently
unable to estimate the range of potential loss, if any, that might result as a
consequence of this action.
