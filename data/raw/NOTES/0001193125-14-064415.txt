Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Subsidiaries Houston, Texas 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries at December31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February24, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. /s/ Deloitte Touche LLP

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Subsidiaries Houston, Texas 
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item9A of this
Form 10-K under the heading Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Acompanys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2013 of the Company and our report dated February24, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General Information Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. is a leader in offshore drilling, providing contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a fleet of 45 offshore drilling rigs, including
five rigs under construction. Our fleet consists of 33 semisubmersibles, two of which are under construction, seven jack-ups, one of which is held for sale, and five dynamically positioned drillships, three of which are under construction. At
December31, 2013, one of our jack-up rigs, the Ocean Spartan, was reported as Asset held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in these Notes to Diamond
Offshore, we, us or our mean Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1989. 
As of February18, 2014, Loews Corporation, or Loews, owned 504% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and our subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. 
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S.,
or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated. Reclassifications
Certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications
currently followed. Such reclassifications did not affect earnings. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that have an original maturity of three months or less and deposits in money
market mutual funds that are readily convertible into cash to be cash equivalents. We had bank deposits denominated in Egyptian pounds totaling $143 million at December31, 2013.However, the local currency is not readily convertible into
U.S. dollars or other currencies at this time. While we believe that a portion of these amounts will be used to fund local operations and obligations in Egyptian pounds in the short term, we reclassified $127 million to Other assets in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2013. The effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in
foreign currencies was not material for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Marketable
Securities We classify our investments in marketable securities as available for sale and they are stated at
fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accordingly, any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive gain loss until realized. The cost of debt
securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and such adjustments are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in Interest income. The sale and purchase of securities are
recorded on the date of the trade. The cost of debt securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains or losses, as well as any declines in value that are judged to be other than temporary, are reported in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other income expense Other, net. Provision for Bad
Debts We record a provision for bad debts on a case-by-case basis when facts and circumstances indicate that a
customer receivable may not be collectible. In establishing these reserves, we consider historical and other factors that predict collectability, including write-offs, recoveries and the monitoring of credit quality.Such provision is reported
as a component of Operating expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 2. 
DIAMOND OFFSHORE/2013 ANNUAL REPORT
51 Table of Contents DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Derivative Financial Instruments 
Our derivative financial instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward exchange, or FOREX, contracts which we may
designate as cash flow hedges. In accordance with GAAP, each derivative contract is stated in the balance sheet at its fair value with gains and losses reflected in the income statement except that, to the extent the derivative qualifies for and is
designated as an accounting hedge, the gains and losses are reflected in income in the same period as offsetting gains and losses on the qualifying hedged positions. Designated hedges are expected to be highly effective, and therefore, adjustments
to record the carrying value of the effective portion of our derivative financial instruments to their fair value are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive gain loss, or AOCGL, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The effective portion of the cash flow hedge will remain in AOCGL until it is reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or it is determined that the hedged transaction will not occur. We
report such realized gains and losses as a component of Contract drilling, excluding depreciation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in our expenditures in local
foreign currencies in the countries in which we operate. Adjustments to record the carrying value of the ineffective
portion of our derivative financial instruments to fair value and realized gains or losses upon settlement of derivative contracts not designated as cash flow hedges are reported as Foreign currency transaction gain loss in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Notes 6 and 7. Assets Held For Sale 
In 2012, our management adopted a plan to actively market for sale three mid-water semisubmersibles, the Ocean Epoch, the
Ocean New Era and the Ocean Whittington, and one jack-up rig, the Ocean Spartan. This decision was based on managements review of our drilling fleet at the end of 2012 and their assessment that three of these rigs had no
short-term outlook for work due to their age and capabilities. These rigs were put on the market for sale at the end of 2012. In connection with the reclassification of these rigs to Assets held for sale, we measured the fair value of each rig in the disposal group using a probability-weighted cash flow
analysis that utilized significant unobservable inputs, representing a Level 3 fair value measurement, which included assumptions for estimated proceeds that may be received upon disposition of the rig and estimated costs to sell. For our three
mid-water semisubmersibles in the disposal group, we determined, at that time, that, due to the expected resale market for rigs of this type and age, the highest and best use of these rigs would be for sale as scrap. Based on our analyses, we
determined that the carrying values of the mid-water semisubmersible rigs in the disposal group were impaired, as the carrying value for each exceeded its aggregate fair value, and recognized an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of 2012. We
determined that the carrying value of the Ocean Spartan was not impaired.  These rigs were not
sold during 2013. The three mid-water semisubmersible rigs have been transferred to Drilling and Other Property and Equipment at their aggregate fair value of $39 million. Only the Ocean Spartan was reported as Assets Held
for Sale at December31, 2013. We reported Assets held for sale aggregating $77 million and $116 million in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. See Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and Note 7.  Drilling and Other Property and Equipment 
We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently
while replacements and betterments, which upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset, are capitalized. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be
required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce
results that differ from those reported. Historically, the amount of capital additions requiring significant judgments, assumptions or estimates has not been significant. During the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012, we capitalized $3020
million and $2203 million, respectively, in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet, resulting from numerous projects ranging from $25,000 to $40 million per project. 
Costs incurred for major rig upgrades and/or the construction of rigs are accumulated in construction work-in-progress, with no
depreciation recorded on the additions, until the month the upgrade or newbuild is completed and the rig is placed in service. Upon retirement or sale of a rig, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and any gains or 
52
DIAMOND OFFSHORE/2013 ANNUAL REPORT Table of Contents DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
losses are included in our results of operations as Gain on disposition of assets. Depreciation is recognized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight-line method over
the remaining estimated useful lives from the year the asset is placed in service. Drilling rigs and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years. 
Capitalized Interest We capitalize interest cost for qualifying construction and upgrade projects. During the three years ended December31, 2013, we capitalized interest on qualifying expenditures, primarily
related to our rig construction projects. See Note 8. A reconciliation of our total interest cost to Interest
expense as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is as follows:  For the Year Ended December31 2013 2012 2011 In thousands Total interest cost including amortization of debt issuance costs 99,080 83,890 84,349 Capitalized interest 74,237 37,674 11,212 
Total interest expense as reported 24,843 46,216 73,137 
Asset Retirement Obligations 
At December31, 2013 and 2012, we had no asset retirement obligations. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such as cold stacking a rig or excess
spending over budget on a newbuild, construction project or major rig upgrade. We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis
include the following:  dayrate by rig;  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used;  the per day operating cost for each rig if active, warm stacked or cold stacked;  the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and/or enhancement programs;  the estimated maintenance, inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work;  salvage value for each rig; and  estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig. 
Based on these assumptions and estimates, we develop a matrix using several different utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of
which we have assigned a probability of occurrence. The sum of our utilization scenarios which include active, warm stacked and cold stacked and probability of occurrence scenarios both equal 100% in the aggregate. We reevaluate our cold-stacked
rigs annually, by updating the matrices for each rig and modifying our assumptions, giving consideration to the length of time the rig has been cold stacked, the current and expected market for the type of rig and expectations of future oil and gas
prices. At December31, 2012, our four cold-stacked rigs were reported as Assets held for sale and had
an aggregate net book value of $116 million. In connection with the presentation of these rigs as held for sale at the end of 2012, we recognized an impairment loss of $624 million. These four rigs remained cold stacked at December31, 2013.
We did not record any impairment with respect to our cold-stacked rigs at December31, 2013. See Assets Held for Sale.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Managements assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment
evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Fair Value
of Financial Instruments We believe that the carrying amount of our current financial instruments approximates
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. For non-current financial instruments we use quoted market prices, when available, and discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. See Note 7. 
Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other assets and are amortized over the respective terms of the related debt. 
Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach
in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax
liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach. We make judgments
regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of
items deducted on tax returns upon audit. We record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest
expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense. See Note 13. Treasury
Stock Depending on market conditions, we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock in the
open market or otherwise. We account for the purchase of treasury stock using the cost method, which reports the cost of the shares acquired in Treasury stock as a deduction from stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. We did not repurchase any shares of our outstanding common stock during 2013, 2012 or 2011. Comprehensive
Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances except those transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Comprehensive income loss for the three years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 includes net
income loss and unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable securities and financial derivatives designated as cash flow accounting hedges. See Note 10. Foreign Currency Our functional currency is the U.S.
dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported as Foreign currency transaction gain loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and include, when applicable, unrealized gains and losses to record the carrying
value of our FOREX contracts not designated as accounting hedges, as well as realized gains and losses from the settlement of such contracts. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized aggregate net foreign currency
gains losses of $49 million, $20 million and $86 million, respectively. See Note 6.

Revenue Recognition 
We recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. In connection with such drilling contracts, we may
receive fees either lump-sum or dayrate for the mobilization of equipment. We earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization fees received, as well as direct and incremental
mobilization costs incurred, and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity. Straight-line amortization of mobilization
revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from 2 to 60 months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed. Absent a contract,
mobilization costs are recognized currently. Some of our drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the
contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements. At times, we may be compensated by the customer for such work either lump-sum or dayrate. These fees are generally earned as services are performed over the initial term of the related
drilling contracts. We defer contract preparation fees received, as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the contract preparation activities and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts
which we estimate to be benefited from the contract preparation activity. From time to time, we may receive fees from
our customers for capital improvements to our rigs either lump-sum or dayrate. We defer such fees received in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize these fees into income
on a straight-line basis over the period of the related drilling contract. We capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement. 
We record reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services provided at the
request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement, for the gross amount billed to the customer, as Revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 2.

Stock-Based Compensation 
Our Second Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or Stock Plan, provides for the issuance of
either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options to our employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Our Stock Plan also authorizes the award of stock appreciation rights, or SARs, in tandem with stock options or separately. The
maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock for which stock options or SARs may be granted is 1,500,000 shares. The exercise price per share may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally,
stock options and SARs vest ratably over a four year period and expire in ten years. Total compensation cost recognized
for Stock Plan transactions, consisting solely of awards of SARs, for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $39 million, $47 million and $50 million, respectively. Tax benefits recognized for the years ended December31,
2013, 2012 and 2011 related thereto were $13 million, $16 million and $17 million, respectively. The fair value of
SARs granted under the Stock Plan during each of the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was estimated using the Black Scholes pricing model. The following are the weighted average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our SARs:  Year Ended December 31 2013 2012 2011 Expected life of SARs in years 7 6 5 Expected volatility 1824 3345 3037 Dividend yield 75 78 76 Risk free interest rate 161 89 154 Expected life of SARs is based on historical data as is the expected volatility. The dividend yield
is based on the current approved regular dividend rate in effect and the current market price at the time of grant. Risk free interest rates are determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve at time of grant with a term equal to the expected life
of the SARs.

Derivative Financial Instruments 
Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts 
Our international operations expose us to foreign exchange risk associated with our costs payable in foreign currencies for
employee compensation, foreign income tax payments and purchases from foreign suppliers. We may utilize FOREX contracts to manage our foreign exchange risk. Our FOREX contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the contracted
foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date, which, for most of our contracts, is the average spot rate for the contract period. We enter into FOREX contracts when we believe market conditions are favorable to purchase contracts for future settlement with the expectation that such contracts, when settled, will reduce our
exposure to foreign currency gains and losses on future foreign currency expenditures. The amount and duration of such contracts is based on our monthly forecast of expenditures in the significant currencies in which we do business and for which
there is a financial market i.e., Australian dollars, Brazilian reais, British pounds sterling, Mexican pesos and Norwegian kroner. These forward contracts are derivatives as defined by GAAP. 
During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we settled FOREX contracts with aggregate notional values of
approximately $3074 million, $3056 million and $3189 million, respectively, of which the entire aggregate amounts were designated as

an accounting hedge. During the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we did not enter into or settle any FOREX contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. 
The following table presents the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations related to our FOREX contracts

As of December31, 2013, we had FOREX contracts outstanding in the aggregate notional amount
of $1141 million, consisting of $153 million in Australian dollars, $724 million in Brazilian reais, $142 million in British pounds sterling, $59 million in Mexican pesos and $63 million in Norwegian kroner. These contracts generally settle
monthly through September 2014. As of December31, 2013, all outstanding derivative contracts had been designated as cash flow hedges. We have International Swap Dealers Association, or ISDA, contracts, which are standardized master legal arrangements that establish key terms and conditions, which govern certain derivative
transactions.Historically, our FOREX contracts have been with two counterparties and have been governed under such ISDA agreements.There are no requirements to post collateral under these contracts; however, they do
containcredit-risk related contingent provisions including credit support provisions and the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of early terminations.Additionally, should our credit rating fall below a specified rating
immediately following the merger of Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. with another entity, the counterparty may require all outstanding derivatives under the ISDA contract to be settled immediately at current market value.Our ISDA arrangements
also include master netting agreements to further manage counterparty credit risk associated with our FOREX contracts.We have elected not to offset the fair value amounts recorded for our derivative contracts under these agreements in our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December31, 2013 and 2012; however, there would have been no significant differences in our Consolidated Balance Sheets if the estimated fair values were presented on a net basis for these periods.

Treasury Lock Agreements 
In connection with the offering of our senior unsecured notes in 2013, we entered into two treasury lock agreements in October 2013
for notional amounts totaling $500 million and designated such contracts as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The agreements were settled in November 2013 upon the completion of the offering of the senior notes for a net gain of $26,728,
before tax. The gain has been recorded as a component of AOCGL and is being amortized to interest expense over the terms of the respective unsecured senior notes. See Note 9.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures 
Concentrations of Credit and Market Risk 
Financial instruments which potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit or market risk consist primarily of
periodic temporary investments of excess cash, trade accounts receivable and investments in debt securities, including mortgage-backed securities. We generally place our excess cash investments in U.S. government backed short-term money market
instruments through several financial institutions. At times, such investments may be in excess of the insurable limit. We periodically evaluate the relative credit standing of these financial institutions as part of our investment strategy.
Most of our investments in debt securities are U.S. government securities with minimal credit risk. However, we are
exposed to market risk due to price volatility associated with interest rate fluctuations. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to our trade accounts receivable are limited primarily due to the entities comprising our customer base. Since the market for our services is the offshore oil and gas industry, this customer base consists primarily of major and
independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2013 and 2012, our largest customer in Brazil, Petrleo Brasileiro S.A. a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian
government, accounted for $1545 million and $1164 million, or 35% and 24%, respectively, of our total consolidated gross trade accounts receivable balance. Our second largest customer in Brazil, OGX Petrleo e Gs Ltda. a privately
owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company that filed for bankruptcy in October 2013, or OGX, accounted for $803 million or 17% of our total consolidated gross trade accounts receivable balance at December31, 2012. Our accounts receivable
balance from OGX was fully reserved at December31, 2013. 
DIAMOND OFFSHORE/2013 ANNUAL REPORT

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
In general, before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior
business relationship and/or whose financial stability may be uncertain to us, we perform a credit review on that company. Based on that analysis, we may require that the customer present a letter of credit, prepay or provide other credit
enhancements. We record a provision for bad debts on a case-by-case basis when facts and circumstances indicate that a customer receivable may not be collectible and, historically, losses on our trade receivables have been infrequent occurrences.
During 2013, based on our assessment of the financial condition of two of our customers, Niko Resources Ltd., or Niko,
and OGX, and our expectations regarding the probability of collection of amounts due to us from them, we recorded $225 million in bad debt expense to fully reserve all outstanding receivables they owed us at June30, 2013. With the exception
of the settlement discussed below, we did not recognize revenue associated with these customers during the second half of 2013. See Note 2. In December 2013, we entered into a settlement agreement with Niko, which we refer to as the Settlement Agreement, whereby Niko will be released from certain obligations under the dayrate contracts
for the Ocean Monarch and Ocean Lexington, subject to and effective upon the full payment of amounts owed to us under the Settlement Agreement and subject to its other conditions. In accordance with the terms of the Settlement
Agreement, we received $250 million in cash during the fourth quarter of 2013, which we recognized as revenue against invoices due us. Niko is further obligated to make future periodic payments to us pursuant to the Settlement Agreement totaling an
aggregate of $550 million, payable at various times through September 2017. We plan to recognize these amounts in revenue as they are received due to the uncertainty regarding their timing and collection. 
Fair Values Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prescribed by GAAP requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 1 assets include short-term investments such as money market funds, U.S. Treasury Bills and Treasury notes.
Our Level 1 assets at December31, 2013 consisted of cash held in money market funds of $2813 million, time deposits of $300 million and investments in U.S. Treasury securities of $1,7499 million. Our Level 1 assets at December31, 2012
consisted of cash held in money market funds of $2649 million, time deposits of $200 million and investments in U.S. Treasury securities of $1,1499 million. Level2
Quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived
valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities include residential mortgage-backed securities and over-the-counter FOREX contracts. Our residential
mortgage-backed securities were valued using a model-derived valuation technique based on the quoted closing market prices received from a financial institution. Our FOREX contracts are valued based on quoted market prices, which are derived from
observable inputs including current spot and forward rates, less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The inputs used in our valuation are obtained from a Bloomberg curve analysis which uses par coupon swap rates to calculate implied
forward rates so that projected floating rate cash flows can be calculated. The valuation techniques underlying the models are widely accepted in the financial services industry and do not involve significant judgment. Level3
Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. Level 3 assets and liabilities generally
include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or
estimation or for which there is a lack of transparency as to the inputs used. Our Level 3 assets at December31, 2013 and 2012 consisted of nonrecurring measurements of certain rigs held for sale for which we recorded an impairment loss in
2012. The value of these rigs was determined using a present value technique which utilized unobservable inputs such as assumptions for estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of each rig and estimated costs to sell. See Note
1.

DIAMOND OFFSHORE/2013 ANNUAL REPORT Table of Contents DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Market conditions could cause an instrument to be reclassified among
Levels1, 2 and 3. Our policy regarding fair value measurements of financial instruments transferred into and out of levels is to reflect the transfers as having occurred at the beginning of the reporting period. There were no transfers between
fair value levels during the years ended December31, 2013 and 2012. Certain of our assets and liabilities are
required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. In addition, certain assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, we record assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
as a result of impairment charges. We did not record any impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended December31, 2013.

amounts of our other financial assets and liabilities excluding long-term debt, which are not measured at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, approximate fair value based on the following assumptions:  Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Accounts receivable and accounts payable The carrying amounts approximate fair value based on the nature of the instruments.

We consider our senior notes, including current maturities, to be Level 2
liabilities under the GAAP fair value hierarchy and, accordingly, the fair value of our senior notes was derived using a third-party pricing service at December31, 2013 and 2012. We perform control procedures over information we obtain from
pricing services and brokers to test whether prices received represent a reasonable estimate of fair value. These procedures include the review of pricing service or broker pricing methodologies and comparing fair value estimates to actual trade
activity executed in the market for these instruments occurring generally within a 10-day window of the report date.

Credit Agreement and Senior Notes 
Credit Agreement We have a syndicated 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, or Credit Agreement, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and swingline lender. Effective December9,
2013, we entered into an extension agreement and amendment to the Credit Agreement, which, among other things, provided for a one-year extension with all of the existing lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $750 million senior unsecured
revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, maturing on September28, 2018. The entire amount of the facility is available for revolving loans. Up to $250 million of the facility is available for the issuance of performance or
other standby letters of credit and up to $75 million is available for swingline loans. Revolving loans under the
Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at a rate per annum based on either an alternate base rate, or ABR, or a Eurodollar Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus the applicable interest margin for an ABR loan or a Eurodollar loan.
The ABR is the greatest of ithe prime rate, iithe federal funds rate plus 050% and iiithe daily one-month Eurodollar Rate plus 100%. The applicable interest margin for ABR loans varies from 0% to 025%. The applicable
interest margin for Eurodollar loans varies between 075% and 125%. Swingline loans bear interest, at our option, at a
rate per annum equal to ithe ABR plus the applicable interest margin for ABR loans or iithe daily one-month Eurodollar Rate plus the applicable interest margin for Eurodollar loans. 
Under our Credit Agreement, we also pay, based on our current credit ratings, and as applicable, other customary fees including,
but not limited to, a commitment fee on the unused commitments under the Credit Agreement, varying between 006% and 020%per annum, and a fronting fee to the issuing bank for each letter of credit. Participation fees for letters of credit are
dependent upon the type of letter of credit issued, varying between 0375% and 0625%per annum for performance letters of credit, and between 075% and 125%per annum for all other letters of credit. Changes in credit ratings could lower
or raise the fees that we pay under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants including,
but not limited to, maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of not more than 60% at the end of each fiscal quarter, as well as limitations on liens; mergers, consolidations,
liquidation and dissolution; changes in lines of business; swap agreements; transactions with affiliates; and subsidiary indebtedness. Based on our current credit ratings at December31, 2013, the applicable margin on ABR loans and Eurodollar loans would have been 000% and 0875%, respectively. As of December31, 2013,
there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Senior Notes

Commitments and Contingencies 
Various claims have been filed against us in the ordinary course of business, including claims by offshore
workers alleging personal injuries. With respect to each claim or exposure, we have made an assessment, in accordance with GAAP, of the probability that the resolution of the matter would ultimately result in a loss. When we determine that an
unfavorable resolution of a matter is probable and such amount of loss can be determined, we record a liability for the amount of the estimated loss at the time that both of these criteria are met. Our management believes that we have recorded
adequate accruals for any liabilities that may reasonably be expected to result from these claims. Litigation.
We are one of several unrelated defendants in lawsuits filed in state courts alleging that defendants manufactured, distributed or utilized drilling mud containing asbestos and, in our case, allowed such drilling mud to have been utilized aboard our
offshore drilling rigs. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, an award of unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The manufacture and use of asbestos-containing drilling mud had already ceased before we acquired any of the drilling rigs
addressed in these lawsuits. We believe that we are not liable for the damages asserted and we expect to receive complete defense and indemnity with respect to a majority of the lawsuits from Murphy Exploration Production Company pursuant
to the terms of our 1992 asset purchase agreement with them. We also believe that we are not liable for the damages asserted in the remaining lawsuits pursuant to the terms of our 1989 asset purchase agreement with Diamond M Corporation, and we
filed a declaratory judgment action in Texas state court against NuStar Energy LP, or NuStar, the successor to Diamond M Corporation, seeking a judicial determination that we did not assume liability for these claims. We obtained summary judgment on
our claims in the declaratory judgment action, but NuStar appealed the trial courts decision, and the appellate court has remanded the case to trial. We are unable to estimate our potential exposure, if any, to these lawsuits at this time but
do not believe that ultimate liability, if any, resulting from this litigation will have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
Various other claims have been filed against us in the ordinary course of business.In the opinion of our management, no
pending or known threatened claims, actions or proceedings against us are expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
We intend to defend these matters vigorously; however, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any litigation
matters specifically described above or any other pending litigation or claims. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits. NPI Arrangement. We received payments measured by a percentage net profits interest of primarily 27% under an overriding royalty interest in certain developmental oil-and-gas producing
properties, or NPI, which we believe is a real property interest.Our drilling program related to the NPI was completed in 2011, and the balance of the amounts due to us under the NPI was received in 2013.However, the customer who
conveyed the NPI to us filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in August of 2012.Certain parties including the debtor in the bankruptcy proceedings have questioned whether our NPI, and certain
amounts we received under it since the filing of the bankruptcy, should be included in the debtors estate under the bankruptcy proceeding.We filed a declaratory judgment action in the bankruptcy court seeking a declaration that our NPI,
and payments that we received from it since the filing of the bankruptcy, are not part of the bankruptcy estate. Once discovery is concluded in the bankruptcy court, the federal district court will hold a trial to determine the nature of our NPI. We
will vigorously defend our rights and pursue our interests in this matter. Personal Injury Claims. Our
deductibles for marine liability insurance coverage, including personal injury claims, which primarily result from Jones Act liability in the Gulf of Mexico, are currently $100 million for the first occurrence, with no aggregate deductible, and
vary in amounts ranging between $50 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $1000 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year.
The Jones Act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work-related injury or death of
an employee. We engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate liability for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models. We allocate a portion of the aggregate liability to
Accrued liabilities based on an estimate of claims expected to be paid within the next twelve months with the residual recorded as Other liabilities. At December31, 2013, our estimated liability for personal injury
claims was $355 million, of which $95 million and $260 million were recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other 
68
DIAMOND OFFSHORE/2013 ANNUAL REPORT Table of Contents DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December31, 2012, our estimated liability for personal injury claims was $361 million, of which $99 million and
$262 million were recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities, respectively, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated
amounts due to uncertainties such as:  the severity of personal injuries claimed;  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims;  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated;  inconsistent court decisions; and  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation. 
Purchase Obligations. Ultra-Deepwater Floater Construction. In May 2013, we entered into an agreement with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd., or Hyundai, for the construction of a 10,000 foot dynamically positioned,
harsh environment semisubmersible drilling rig. The Ocean GreatWhite is under construction in South Korea at an estimated cost of $755 million, including commissioning, capital spares and project management costs. The contracted price to
Hyundai, totaling $6285 million, is payable in two installments, of which the first installment of $1886 million was paid in 2013. The final installment of $4399 million is due upon delivery of the rig, which is expected to occur in the first
quarter of 2016. Drillship Construction. We are financially obligated under four separate turnkey construction
contracts with Hyundai for the construction of four ultra-deepwater drillships. We expect the aggregate cost of the construction of our drillships, including commissioning, capital spares and project management costs, to be approximately $26
billion. The contracted price of each drillship is payable to Hyundai in two installments, with final payment due on delivery of each drillship. We have paid the first installment for each of the four drillships, aggregating $6476 million. The
Ocean Black Hawk, the first of our four drillships to be completed, was delivered in late January 2014, and we paid the final installment due to Hyundai of $3961 million upon delivery of the drillship. The Ocean BlackHornet is
expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2014 at which time the second installment of approximately $394 million will be payable to Hyundai. The Ocean BlackRhino and Ocean BlackLion are expected to be delivered in the third
quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015, respectively, at which times approximately $395 million will be payable to Hyundai for each rig. Ocean Onyx Construction. We were obligated under a vessel modification agreement with Keppel AmFELS, L.L.C., or Keppel, for the construction of the Ocean Onyx, a moored semisubmersible
deepwater rig, which was delivered late in the fourth quarter of 2013. We estimate the aggregate cost for the construction of the Ocean Onyx to be approximately $3660 million, including commissioning, capital spares and project management
costs. The contracted price due to Keppel was payable in 11 installments based on the occurrence of certain events as detailed in the vessel modification agreement. As of December31, 2013, we had paid the first ten installments, of which we
paid $730 million and $657 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. We paid the final installment payable to Keppel under the construction agreement of $73 million in January 2014. 
Ocean Apex Construction. We are obligated under a vessel modification agreement with Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd, or Jurong, for
the construction of the Ocean Apex, a moored semisubmersible deepwater rig, which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2014 at an aggregate cost of approximately $3700 million, including commissioning, capital spares and
project management costs. The contracted price due to Jurong is payable in 12 installments based on the occurrence of certain events as detailed in the vessel modification agreement. We have paid the first seven installments, of which we paid $541
million and $270 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The remaining $541 million in aggregate milestone payments is payable to Jurong during 2014 as construction milestones are met. 
Ocean Patriot Enhancements. In February 2013, we entered into a vessel modification agreement with Keppel FELS Limited, or
Keppel Singapore, for enhancements to the Ocean Patriot that will enable the rig to work in the North Sea. We estimate the cost of the 
DIAMOND OFFSHORE/2013 ANNUAL REPORT
69 Table of Contents DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
enhancement project to be approximately $1200 million, including shipyard costs, owner-furnished equipment and labor, commissioning and capital spares. Construction work commenced in Singapore
in the fourth quarter of 2013 and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2014. The contracted price due Keppel Singapore is approximately $290 million, payable in seven installments based on the occurrence of certain events as
detailed in the vessel modification agreement. We paid the first four installments due to Keppel Singapore aggregating $188 million in 2013. The remaining $102 million in aggregate milestone payments are payable to Keppel Singapore during 2014 as
construction milestones are met. At December31, 2013 and 2012, we had no other purchase obligations for major rig
upgrades or any other significant obligations, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business. Operating Leases. We lease office and yard facilities, housing, equipment and vehicles under operating leases, which expire at various times through the year 2018. Total rent expense amounted
to $135 million, $108 million and $93 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future minimum rental payments under leases are approximately $29 million and $16 million for the years 2014 and 2015,
respectively, and $12 million in the aggregate for the years 2016 to 2018. There are no minimum future rental payments under operating leases after 2018. Letters of Credit and Other. We were contingently liable as of December31, 2013 in the amount of $782 million under certain performance, bid, supersedeas, tax appeal and custom bonds
and letters of credit. Agreements relating to approximately $674 million of performance, security, supersedeas and customs bonds can require collateral at any time. As of December31, 2013, we had not been required to make any collateral
deposits with respect to these agreements. The remaining agreements cannot require collateral except in events of default. On our behalf, banks have issued letters of credit securing certain of these bonds. 12.
Related-Party Transactions 
Transactions with Loews. We are party to a services agreement with Loews, or the Services Agreement,
pursuant to which Loews performs certain administrative and technical services on our behalf. Such services include personnel, internal auditing, accounting, and cash management services, in addition to advice and assistance with respect to
preparation of tax returns and obtaining insurance. Under the Services Agreement, we are required to reimburse Loews for iallocated personnel costs such as salaries, employee benefits and payroll taxes of the Loews personnel actually
providing such services and iiall out-of-pocket expenses related to the provision of such services. The Services Agreement may be terminated at our option upon 30 days notice to Loews and at the option of Loews upon six months
notice to us. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify Loews for all claims and damages arising from the provision of services by Loews under the Services Agreement unless due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Loews. We were charged
$10million, $08 million and $11 million by Loews for these support functions during the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Transactions with Other Related Parties. We hire marine vessels and helicopter transportation services at the prevailing market rate from subsidiaries of SEACOR Holdings Inc. and Era Group
Inc. The Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of SEACOR Holdings Inc. and the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Era Group Inc. is also a member of our Board of Directors. We paid $01million in each of the three years
ended December31, 2013 for the hire of such vessels and such services. During the years ended December31,
2013, 2012 and 2011, we made payments of $16 million, $10million and $12 million, respectively, to Ernst Young LLP for tax and other consulting services. The wife of our President and Chief Executive Officer is an audit partner
at this firm.  13.
Income Taxes 
Our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre-tax earnings or losses, as well as the
mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. Certain of our international rigs are owned and operated indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, or DOIL, a foreign subsidiary which we wholly own. It is our intention to
indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DOIL and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Accordingly, we have not made a provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately $24 billion of undistributed foreign earnings and profits.
Although we do not intend to repatriate the earnings of DOIL, and have not provided U.S. income taxes for such earnings, except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to U.S. income taxes, these earnings could become subject to
U.S. income tax if remitted, or if deemed remitted as a dividend; however, it is not practical to estimate this potential liability.

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards As of December31, 2013, we
had recorded a deferred tax asset of $120 million for the benefit of NOL carryforwards related to our international operations. Approximately $112 million of this deferred tax asset relates to NOL carryforwards that have an indefinite life. The
remaining $08 million relates to NOL carryforwards of our Mexican entities. Unless utilized, the tax benefits of these Mexican NOL carryforwards will expire between 2021 and 2023 as follows:  Year Expiring

As of December31, 2013, a valuation allowance of $73 million has been recorded for our NOLs
as only $47 million of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized. Unrecognized Tax Benefits.
Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we are currently contesting various tax assessments. We accrue for income tax contingencies, or uncertain tax positions, that we
believe are more likely than not exposures.

recognized. The following table presents the amount of accrued interest and penalties at December31, 2013 and

In several of the international locations in which we operate, certain of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations. We apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for
providing the services and equipment. In most cases, there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and, if applied, could result in different chargeable amounts. Taxing authorities in the various
foreign locations in which we operate could apply one of the alternative transfer pricing methodologies which could result in an increase to our income tax liabilities with respect to tax returns that remain subject to examination. 
Tax Returns and Examinations. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions and
various foreign jurisdictions. Tax years that remain subject to examination by these jurisdictions include years 2003 to 2012. We are currently under audit in several of these jurisdictions. We do not anticipate that any adjustments resulting from
the tax audit of any of these years will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. U.S. Tax Jurisdiction. In May 2013, we were notified by the Department of the Treasury that the Internal Revenue Service audit of our 2010 corporate tax return was completed without adjustment.
Brazil Tax Jurisdiction. In March 2013, the Brazilian tax authorities began an audit of our income tax returns for the
years 2009 and 2010. In addition, we are continuing to defend tax assessments by the Brazilian tax authorities for the years 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2007. In February 2012, the tax authorities concluded their audit of our income tax return for the 2007 tax year for which we received an assessment of R$351 million approximately equal to USD $15
million at December31, 2013 for income tax, including interest and penalties. We contested the assessment and a court in Brazil ruled to cancel the assessment. However, the Brazilian tax authorities have appealed the ruling, and we are
awaiting the outcome of the appeal. We have not accrued any tax expense related to this assessment. In December 2009,
we received an assessment of approximately $260 million for the years 2004 and 2005, including interest and penalty. We contested the tax assessment in January 2010 and are awaiting the outcome of the appeal. As required by GAAP, only the portion
of the tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement is to be recognized. Consequently, we have accrued approximately $99 million of expense attributable to the portion of the tax assessment we determined to
be an uncertain tax position, of which approximately $34 million is interest related and approximately $28 million is penalty related. In addition, the tax auditors have issued an assessment for tax year 2000 of approximately $15 million, including interest and penalty. We have appealed the tax assessment and are awaiting the
outcome of the appeal. During 2011, unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by approximately $68 million due to the
lapse in the applicable statute of limitations for the 2006 tax year, of which $11 million was interest and $20 million was penalty. Mexico Tax Jurisdiction. The tax authorities in Mexico previously audited our income tax returns for the years 2004 and 2006 and had issued assessments for tax years 2004 and 2006 of approximately
$229 million and $244 million, respectively, including interest and penalties, which we had appealed. In 2013 the Mexican tax authorities initiated a tax amnesty program whereby income tax assessments, including penalties and interest, could be
partially or completely waived. Under the tax amnesty, we were able to settle our tax liabilities for the years 2004 and 2006 for a net cash cost of $37 million. As a result of increases in uncertain tax positions for later years, we recorded an
additional $132 million of expense, including $50 million of interest and $27 million of penalties.

Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in Mexico for the 2007 tax
year at the end of June 2013, during the second quarter of 2013, we reversed our $43 million accrual for this uncertain tax position, of which $15 million was interest and $06 million was penalty. 
In addition, in August 2012, the Mexican tax authorities dismissed a claim against one of our Mexican subsidiaries and the 2004 tax
year for that subsidiary is now closed. Consequently, during the third quarter of 2012, we reversed our $44 million accrual for this uncertain tax position, which included $02 million of penalty and $26 million of interest. 
On June13, 2013 we received official notification that the Mexican tax authorities will be auditing the 2008 income tax
return of one of our Mexican subsidiaries. Egypt Tax Jurisdiction. During 2013 we were under audit by the
Egyptian tax authorities for the tax years 2006 through 2010. In December 2013, we received notification that the Egyptian government had concluded the income tax audit for the period 2006 to 2008 and a $12 billion increase to taxable income was
proposed. We disagree with the tax audit findings and intend to vigorously pursue all legal remedies available to defend ourselves against any ensuing tax assessment. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the Egyptian income tax law, we
have accrued approximately $569 million of expense for uncertain tax positions in Egypt, of which approximately $314 million is penalty related. We recently completed operating in Egypt and no longer have drilling operations there. 
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the Act, was signed into law on
January2, 2013. The Act extends through 2013 several expired or expiring temporary business provisions, commonly referred to as extenders, which are retroactively extended to the beginning of 2012. As required by GAAP, the effects
of new legislation are recognized when signed into law. Consequently, we reduced our 2013 tax expense by $275 million as a result of recognizing the 2012 effect of the extenders. 14.
Employee Benefit Plans 
Defined Contribution Plans 
We maintain defined contribution retirement plans for our U.S., United Kingdom, or U.K., and third-country national, or TCN,
employees. The plan for our U.S. employees, or the 401k Plan, is designed to qualify under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Under the 401k Plan, each participant may elect to defer taxation on a
portion of his or her eligible earnings, as defined by the 401k Plan, by directing his or her employer to withhold a percentage of such earnings. A participating employee may also elect to make after-tax contributions to the 401k Plan. During each
year ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made a 4% profit-share contribution of participants defined compensation and matched up to 6% of each employees compensation contributed to the 401k Plan. Participants are fully vested
in the employer match immediately upon enrollment in the 401k Plan and subject to a three-year cliff vesting period for the profit sharing contribution. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our provision for contributions was
$296 million, $259 million and $215 million, respectively. The defined contribution retirement plan for our U.K.
employees provides that we make annual contributions in an amount equal to the employees contributions generally up to a maximum percentage of the employees defined compensation per year. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012
and 2011, our contribution for employees working in the U.K. sector of the North Sea was up to a maximum of 10%, 10% and 525%, respectively, of the employees defined compensation. For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, our
contribution for U.K. nationals working in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea was up to a maximum of 15%, 15% and 90%, respectively, of the employees defined compensation. Our provision for contributions was $35 million, $27 million and
$12 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The defined contribution
retirement plan for our TCN employees, or International Savings Plan, is similar to the 401k Plan. During each year ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we contributed 4% of participants defined compensation and matched up to
6%of each employees compensation contributed to the International Savings Plan. Our provision for contributions was $31 million, $28million and $29 million for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
Our Amended and Restated Diamond Offshore Management Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or
Supplemental Plan, provides benefits to a select group of our management or other highly compensated employees to compensate such employees for any portion of our base salary contribution and/or matching contribution under the 401k Plan that could
not be contributed to that plan because of limitations within the Code. Our provision for contributions to the Supplemental Plan for the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $261,000, $256,000 and $245,000,
respectively.  15.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the federal securities
laws, including this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us under the
federal securities laws is accumulated and communicated to our management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, participated in an evaluation by our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e as of December31, 2013. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2013.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f for Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well
designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by
management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal controls can provide no more than reasonable
assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared. 
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making
this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992. Based on this assessment our management
believes that, as of December31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
Deloitte Touche LLP, the registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report of Deloitte Touche LLP is included at the beginning of Item8 of this Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the foregoing evaluation that
occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B.Other Information. Not applicable.
