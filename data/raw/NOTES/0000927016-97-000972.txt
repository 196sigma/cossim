ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Report of Independent Public Accountants To Open Market, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Open Market,
Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable convertible
preferred stock and stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for the
period from inception April 25, 1994 to December 31, 1994 and for the two
years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Open
Market, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the period from inception April
25, 1994 to December 31, 1994 and for the two years in the period ended
December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

OPEN MARKET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data 1 Operations
Open Market, Inc. the Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware
on December 6, 1993 and began operations on April 25, 1994. The Company
develops, markets, licenses and supports high performance software products
that allow its customers to engage in business-to-consumer and business-to-
business electronic commerce on the Internet and to deploy Internet-based
business applications within an enterprise Intranet. The Company
innovative technology enables the separation of the management of business
transactions from the management of content, thereby allowing companies to
securely and centrally manage business transactions using content located
on multiple distributed Web servers. The Company products permit
functions such as order taking, authorization, payment processing, security
and customer service to be performed centrally by a back office
transaction management system, allowing merchants and other content
providers to focus on management of the front office content at their
distributed Web sites.
In the first quarter of 1997, the Company made two significant acquisitions
that represent its entry into the front office market. These
acquisitions were of Waypoint Software Corporation and Folio Corporation.
Waypoint specializes in the business-to-business industrial catalog segment
of the Internet, and Folio is a leading supplier of software for managing
business-critical information. With these acquisitions, the Company
believes it will be able to provide complete front-to-back Internet
commerce solutions for key industry segments primed to take advantage of
Internet commerce see Note 13.
The Company is subject to risks common to rapidly growing technology-based
companies, including a limited operating history, dependence on key
personnel, rapid technological change, competition from substitute products
and larger companies, and the successful development and marketing of
commercial products and services.
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application
of the following significant accounting policies described in this note and
elsewhere in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
a Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements, include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.   b Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Position No. 91-1 SOP 91-1, Software Revenue
Recognition. The Company generates revenue from licensing the rights
to use its software products to end users, porting its products to
hardware manufacturers' operating
-24 
2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
environments, and sublicense fees from resellers. The Company also
generates service revenues from the sale of post-contract customer
support and the sale of certain consulting and development services.
Revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon shipment
of the software if there are no significant post-delivery obligations,
and payment is due within one year. If an acceptance period is
required, revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance. The
Company enters into reseller arrangements for certain products that
typically provide for sublicense fees payable to the Company based on
a percentage of the Company list price. Royalty and sublicense
revenues from the Company reseller arrangements are recognized when
earned, either on a per-unit basis as reported to the Company by its
licensees, or, with respect to guaranteed minimums, upon shipment of
the master copies of all software to which the guaranteed minimum
sublicense fees relate, if there are no significant post-delivery
obligations. Revenues for post-contract customer support are
recognized ratably over the term of the support period, which is
typically one year. Revenues from development and consulting services
are recognized upon customer acceptance or over the period in which
services are provided, if customer acceptance is not required, and the
revenues are fixed and determinable.
Cost of product revenues consists of costs to distribute the product,
including the cost of the media on which it is delivered and royalty
payments to third-party vendors. Cost of service revenues consists
primarily of consulting and support personnel salaries and related
costs.
Deferred revenues represent cash received from customers for products
and services in advance of revenue recognition.
c Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company accounts for investments under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Under SFAS No. 115,
investments for which the Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold to maturity, consisting of cash equivalents and marketable
securities, are reported at amortized cost, which approximates fair
market value. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities are
investment-grade securities with original maturities of greater than
three months but less than one year. To date, the Company has not
recorded any realized gains or losses.

2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
d Depreciation and Amortization
The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the
straight-line method to allocate the cost of property and equipment
over their estimated useful lives as follows                          ESTIMATED 
ASSET CLASSIFICATION    USEFUL LIFE
Computers and office equipment   3-5 Years
Leasehold improvements      Lease term
Furniture and fixtures        7 Years
e Research and Development Expenses
The Company has evaluated the establishment of technological
feasibility of its products in accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software To Be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed. The Company sells products in a market that is subject to
rapid technological change, new product development and changing
customer needs; accordingly, the Company has concluded that
technological feasibility is not established until the development
stage of the product is nearly complete. The Company defines
technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. The
time period during which costs could be capitalized, from the point of
reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product
release, is very short, and consequently, the amounts that could be
capitalized are not material to the Company financial position or
results of operations. Therefore, the Company has charged all such
costs to research and development in the period incurred.
f Pro Forma Net Loss Per Common and Common Equivalent Share
For the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, pro forma net loss per
common and common equivalent share is computed by dividing the net
loss by the pro forma weighted average number of common and common

the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, ii the
number of shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of all
shares of Series A, B and C redeemable convertible preferred stock and
iii stock options granted during the period of March 31, 1995
through March 31, 1996, which have been reflected as outstanding using
the treasury stock method, as required by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Common stock equivalents issued in earlier periods have
not been included, as the effect would be antidilutive. Historical net
loss per share data for the period from inception April 25, 1994 to
December 31, 1994 has not been presented, as such information is not
considered to be relevant or meaningful.

h Postretirement Benefits
The Company has no obligations for postretirement benefits.
i Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments,
which include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts
receivable and long-term debt, approximate their carrying value.
j Use of Estimates
The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements
required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the
Company assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
3 Long-Term Obligations
a Line of Credit and Term Notes Payable
In 1995, the Company entered into a capital equipment line of credit
under which it could borrow up to $1,500. In October 1995 and March
1996, the Company converted $850 and $635, respectively, of its
capital equipment line of credit into term notes payable. The term
notes were paid in full during 1996.

3 Long-Term Obligations Continued
b Obligation Under License Agreement
During 1994, the Company entered into a license agreement with a
university to utilize certain patented computer software. The Company
recorded the present value of the future commitments under the
contract, $217, as a component of research and development expense
during 1994.
At December 31, 1996, the Company obligation under its license
agreement is as follows:
AMOUNT
Year Ended December 31,
1997                   $ 52
1998                    52

4 Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, the objective of which is to recognize the amount of current
and deferred income taxes payable or refundable at the date of the
financial statements as a result of all events that have been recognized in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as measured by enacted
tax laws.
The provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 1996
consists of foreign income and withholding taxes.
At December 31, 1996, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of approximately $39,000, which expire through
2011. The Company also has certain tax credits available to offset future
federal and state income taxes, if any. Net operating loss carryforwards
and credits are subject to review and possible adjustments by the Internal
Revenue Service and may be limited in the event of certain cumulative
changes in excess of 50% in the ownership interests of significant
stockholders over a three-year period. The Company believes it has
experienced a change in ownership in excess of 50%. The Company does not
believe that this change in ownership will significantly impact the
Company ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards.
-28 
4 Income Taxes Continued
The components of the Company deferred tax asset are as follows:
1996   1995
Operating loss carryforwards   $15,600  $5,435
Tax credit carryforwards       367   130
Temporary differences        547   576
16,514  6,141
Less--Valuation allowance     16,514  6,141
Net deferred tax assets  $   -  $  -
It is the Company objective to become a profitable enterprise and to
realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. However, in evaluating the
realizability of these deferred tax assets, management has considered the
Company short operating history, the volatility of the market in which it
competes, the operating losses incurred to date and the operating losses
anticipated in the future, and believes that given the significance of this
evidence, a full valuation reserve against its deferred tax assets is
required as of December 31, 1996 and 1995. The increase in the valuation
allowance during these periods primarily relates to the Company operating
results.
5 Stockholders' Equity Deficit
a Preferred Stock
In April 1996, the Company Board of Directors authorized the
issuance of up to 2,000,000 shares of $10 par value preferred stock.
At December 31, 1996, no such shares are issued and outstanding.
b Common Stock
In April 1996, the stockholders authorized the issuance of up to
100,000,000 shares of common stock. At December 31, 1996, there are
6,446,000 shares reserved for issuance under the Company option and
stock purchase plans. Subsequent to year-end, the Company issued
additional shares in connection with the Waypoint and Folio
acquisitions see Note 13.
c Initial Public Offering
In May 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
4,600,000 shares of its common stock at $1800 per share. The Company
received net proceeds of approximately $76,127 after deducting the
underwriters' commission and issuance costs. Upon the closing of the
initial public offering, all shares of the Company Series A, B and C
redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted into
13,437,000 shares of the Company common stock.

5 Stockholders' Equity Deficit Continued
d 1994 Stock Incentive Plan
The Company Board of Directors adopted the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan
the Incentive Plan. Under the Incentive Plan, as amended, the
Company has reserved and may issue up to 13,001,000 shares of common
stock or options to purchase common stock. As of December 31, 1996,
there are 1,029,000 shares available for issuance under the Incentive
Plan.
RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK
In 1994, the Company sold 5,813,000 shares of restricted common
stock to employees at $00033 per share. These shares were subject
to repurchase agreements and were scheduled to vest over a four-year
period. The Company could have repurchased any unvested shares of
common stock held by these individuals upon the termination of their
employment at $00033 per share. During 1995, the Company
repurchased 74,000 shares of unvested common stock. All of the
unvested shares became vested upon the completion of the Company
initial public offering in May 1996.
OPTIONS
Under the terms of the Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors may
grant incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options to
purchase shares of the Company common stock. The purchase price
and vesting schedule applicable to each option grant are determined
by the Board of Directors. Options generally vest over a four-year
period and expire 10 years from the date of grant. From inception
April 25, 1994 through December 31, 1996, options under the
Incentive Plan have been granted at their then fair market value.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded for grants
under the Incentive Plan.
The following is a summary of the stock option activity:
NUMBER OF  PRICE PER SHARE
SHARES      SHARE 
Outstanding, December 31, 1994       -       -
Granted            5,032,000   $ 17-$ 150

5 Stockholders' Equity Deficit Continued
e The 1996 Director Option Plan
In April 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1996
Director Option Plan the Director Plan whereby the Company has
reserved and may issue up to 100,000 shares of common stock. Under the
terms of the Director Plan, each newly elected director who is not a
founder or employee of the Company will be granted an option to
purchase that number of shares of common stock determined by dividing
$100 by the option exercise price, at the then fair market value, as
defined. In addition, commencing with the 1997 annual meeting of the
stockholders and for every annual meeting of stockholders thereafter,
each outside director will be granted an option to purchase that
number shares of common stock determined by dividing $30 by the option
exercise price at the then fair market value. These options vest over
a four-year period and expire 10 years from the date of grant. The
vesting of these options will accelerate upon a change of control, as
defined. At December 31, 1996, there were no options outstanding under
the Director Plan.
f The 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In April 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved the 1996
Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan whereby the Company
has reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 250,000 shares of
common stock in semiannual grants, in January and July, at a price
equal to 85% of fair market value, as defined. As of December 31,
1996, no shares were issued under the Purchase Plan. In January 1997,
the Company issued 24,000 shares under the Purchase Plan.
g Pro Forma Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS No.
123 requires the measurement of the fair value of stock options or
warrants granted to employees to be included in the statement of
operations or, alternatively, disclosed in the notes to consolidated
financial statements. The Company has determined that it will continue
to account for stock-based compensation for employees under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and elect the disclosure-only
alternative under SFAS No. 123. The Company records the fair market
value of stock options and warrants granted to nonemployees in the
consolidated statement of operations. The Company has computed the pro
forma disclosures required under SFAS No. 123 for stock options
granted in 1996 and 1995 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The weighted average assumptions used for 1996 and 1995 are:
1996     1995
Risk-free interest rate   554%-676% 563%-744%
Expected dividend yield       -      -
Expected life         7 years   7 years
Expected volatility        70%     70%
-31 
5 Stockholders' Equity Deficit Continued
g Pro Forma Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation Continued
The total value of the options granted to employees during 1996 and
1995 was computed as approximately $9,716 and $1,056, respectively. Of
these amounts approximately $4,725 and $244 would be charged to
operations for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The remaining amount, approximately $5,802, would be
amortized over the remaining vesting periods. The pro forma effect of
these option grants for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 is
as follows: 
1996           1995
AS REPORTED PRO FORMA  AS REPORTED PRO FORMA
Net loss      $26,510  $31,235  $13,872  $14,116
Net loss per share $  96  $ 113  $  53  $  53
The resulting pro forma compensation expense may not be representative
of the amount to be expected in future years as the pro forma expense
may vary based upon the number of options granted. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair
value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option pricing models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options
and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its employee stock options.
h Common Stock Purchase Warrant
During September 1996, the Company issued a stock purchase warrant to
one of its customers for the purchase of 100,000 shares of the
Company common stock at an exercise price of $2500 per share. The
warrant may be exercised at any time and expires on December 31, 1997.
At the time of issuance, the Company recorded a charge of $211,
representing the fair market value of the warrant, as calculated using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company has reserved the
number of shares of common stock necessary for issuance under this
stock purchase warrant.
6 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
The Company Board of Directors authorized 7,500,000 shares of preferred
stock and designated 1,850,000, 1,850,000 and 3,000,000 of such shares as
Series A, B and C redeemable convertible preferred stock, respectively
Series A, B and C Preferred Stock. The Company Series A, B and C
Preferred Stock were issued as follows:
NUMBER OF    PRICE 
DATE              DESCRIPTION         SHARES    PER SHARE          
June 1994             Series A Preferred Stock  1,850,000   $ 1000 
April, August and October 1995   Series B Preferred Stock  1,731,000   $ 5405   
January and March 1996       Series C Preferred Stock  2,695,000   $10000
-32 
6 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock Continued
In connection with the Company initial public offering Note 5c, all
outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock were converted
into 13,437,000 shares of common stock. The Series A, B and C Preferred
Stock had the following rights, preferences and privileges. The Series A, B
and C Preferred Stock had liquidation preference over common stock in the
event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. At the
request of the majority of the Series A, B and C Preferred Stockholders,
the Company would have been required to redeem these shares for the
redemption price plus any declared but unpaid dividends. The Series A, B
and C Preferred Stock were also entitled to vote with the common
stockholders as a single class, as defined, and to receive dividends
declared or paid on any shares of common stock in preference to dividends
on common stock. The Series A, B and C Preferred Stockholders also had
registration rights and the right of first refusal to purchase any new
securities offered by the Company, as defined. These rights, preferences
and privileges terminated upon the completion of the Company initial
public offering.

13 Subsequent Events
a Waypoint Software Corporation
On February 12, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Waypoint Software Corporation Waypoint, a
software development company specializing in the business-to-business
industrial catalog segment of the Internet. As payment of the purchase
price, the Company issued an aggregate of 739,000 shares of its common
stock to the stockholders of Waypoint and issued options to acquire
6,000 shares of the Company common stock at $0456 per share to
Waypoint option holders. The value of the shares of, and the options
to acquire, the Company common stock issued in connection with the
acquisition was approximately $11,000. The number of shares of common
stock issued was based on a weighted average market price, as defined,
of the Company freely tradable shares. The shares issued are subject
to certain selling restrictions and, as a result, are not currently
freely tradable. Therefore, for purposes of calculating aggregate
consideration paid, the value of the shares issued will be recorded at
a discounted value. The Company has not determined the discount to be
applied to the value of the shares issued. In addition, in connection
with this acquisition, the Company has entered into employment
agreements with certain of the principals of Waypoint under which the
Company has agreed to pay bonuses in an aggregate amount of $1,200
over two years depending on certain future events, as defined. The
acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase, with a significant
portion of the purchase price being allocated to in-process research
and development and expensed at the time of closing.
b Folio Corporation
On March 7, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of Folio Corporation Folio, a leading supplier of
software for managing business-critical information, for $45,000 in
equity and cash, subject to certain closing adjustments, as defined.
The purchase consideration was paid in the form of $25,000 in equity
898,000 shares issuable upon closing and an equal amount issuable in
January 1998, $10,000 in cash upon closing and a $10,000, 8% 
interest-bearing note, which is payable over a period of up to two 
years in cash or a combination of cash and equity depending on certain
future events, as defined. The number of shares of common stock issued
was based on a weighted average market price, as defined, of freely
tradable shares. The shares issued are subject to certain selling
restrictions and, as a result, are not currently freely tradable.
Therefore, for purposes of calculating aggregate consideration paid,
the value of the shares issued will be recorded
