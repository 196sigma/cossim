1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business and Company Organization. We deliver chemistry products and services, software products and services along with analysis services that advance customers' creativity and productivity in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and related life sciences research enterprises worldwide. We are also a value-added reseller of third-party hardware products required to operate our software products. A substantial portion of our business is conducted with pharmaceutical companies. During 2004, 54% of our revenue came from our relationships with Pfizer, Inc. while in 2003, 52% and in 2002, 33%, of our global revenue was from Pfizer.
Basis of Consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tripos and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates, owned more than 20%, but not in excess of 50%, are recorded on the equity method. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates less than 20% owned are accounted for under the cost method, except for those investments classified as marketable securities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date purchased. 
Marketable Securities consist of investments in equity securities of unconsolidated affiliates that are held as available-for-sale and foreign currency exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. We account for securities that can be sold within the next 12 months as marketable securities. Amounts presented are the fair values of the investments on the balance sheet date determined using then current market quotes. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as increases or decreases in the assets' value pre-tax basis with corresponding entries reflected in Other Comprehensive Income and Deferred Taxes until the assets are sold. See Note 18 Financial Instruments for a further discussion of foreign currency exchange instruments. Marketable Securities at December 31, 2004 consisted of 33 shares of NuVasive, Inc. which had a market value of $341. At December 31, 2003, Marketable Securities on the Balance Sheet was comprised of 31 shares of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
which had a market value of $192. Other Comprehensive Income at December 31, 2004 and 2003 included an accumulated unrealized after-tax gain of $96 and $83, respectively, as calculated on an average cost per share basis. 
Investments Recorded at Cost consist of investments in common stock and limited partnerships that are accounted for under the cost method as permitted under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18. 
Accounts Receivable includes current outstanding invoices billed to customers. Invoices are typically issued with Net 30-day terms upon shipment of product or upon achievement of billable events for service-based contracts. Our bad debt experience from uncollectible accounts has been historically immaterial. As a result, we provide a reserve for bad debts on a specific account basis if and when customer payment problems arise.
Capitalization and Valuation of Chemical Compound Costs. Initial costs to develop our LeadQuest compounds chemical compounds for sale for use in drug discovery are categorized as research and development expense until such time as it is probable that a salable library can be successfully produced. Therefore, costs for design, research, and analytical procedures for every library of compounds are expensed as incurred. Our research chemists review the results of analytical procedures to determine if the chemical reactions completed are as expected and the product purity and product yields are within acceptable tolerances. This validation process determines whether the chemistry is successful and if a saleable product will result. We capitalize costs to inventory once the validation process is completed and successful production is reasonably assured. If the core reaction is unsuccessful, the library template is abandoned and no further development takes 
place. 
Similarly, we capitalize the costs of LeadDiscovery packages once we are reasonably assured of the success of the underlying chemistry. After this point we capture the costs of labor, chemicals and screening activity into work in process inventory. Should a LeadDiscovery library not reach its full potential as a standalone offering, we can utilize the products within discovery research contracts for customers or in our LeadQuest compound library.
Inventory amounts shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are net of an obsolescence reserve. In calculating the reserve for inventory held for sale, the age and sales trends of each category in the inventory are taken into account to determine the net realizable value. Any shortfall between the carrying cost of the inventory and the net realizable value
1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
is provided for in the reserve. A portion of the LeadQuest inventory is used in discovery research projects. This portion of the inventory asset is depreciated over its 10-year expected useful life.
Accounting Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Property and Equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by applying an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to ten years for equipment and furniture, twenty-five to thirty-nine years for buildings, the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the life of the related lease term for leasehold improvements, and three years for purchased software. We make every attempt to closely match the book useful life of our assets to their expected productive lives. Assets deemed to be impaired or no longer productive, are written down to their net realizable value.
Capitalized interest. The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project or asset. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete. Capitalized interest for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $39, $257 and $30, respectively. 
Development Costs primarily consist of software development costs related to new products that are capitalized after the establishment of technological feasibility working model in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86. During 2004, 2003 and 2002 capitalized costs were $639, $1,272 and $1,416, respectively related to development work on a laboratory research and inventory support system along with other desktop technologies to be marketed to external customers. Amortization of capitalized software development costs is provided on a product-by-product basis as the greater of a the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues or b the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Currently, we use an estimated economic life of three to five years for all capitalized software development costs. We assess the recoverability of capi
talized software development costs by comparing the remaining unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the related product. Any excess is written off. During the fourth quarter of 2004 we wrote down one of our capitalized products, ChemCoreRIO, by $890 to properly reflect the current net realizable value of the product based upon the change in target market customer base. For 2004, 2003 and 2002, amortization of software developed for sale was $6, $258 and $309, respectively. At times, we capitalize development costs attributable to internal use software in accordance with AICPA Statement Of Position 98-1 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Amortization of internal use software is over the estimated useful life or three years, which ever is less. During 2004 we wrote off the cost and accumulated amortization for fully amortized capitalized software assets for internal use in the amount of $544.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the net assets acquired of Tripos Discovery Research Ltd. over its fair value. The recorded goodwill is a component of our Discovery Research segment, which is geographically part of our European region. There were no additions or write-offs of goodwill during the periods presented. Beginning in 2002, we have adopted Statement of Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142, that suspends amortization of goodwill in favor of annual evaluations of impairment by comparing the fair value of the business to which the goodwill relates to its carrying value. If it is determined that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss in earnings at that time. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. We performed formal impairment tests of goodwill in 2004, 2003 and 2002 by using a disco
unted cash flow approach to estimate fair value. Based on our evaluations, we determined there was no impairment of the remaining goodwill. We will continue to do so on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of Tripos Discovery Research Ltd. below its carrying value.
Other Intangible Assets. The Company from time to time will apply for and obtain a patent to protect the interests in our proprietary software and chemistry research properties. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $183 and $185, respectively was recorded in Other Assets related to patents. Patent costs are amortized over a 20-year period. Accumulated amortization related to patents was $93 and $82 as December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the year-ended December 31, 2004, the aggregate amortization expense recorded was $11. The estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is $11 in 2005, 2006, and 2007, $9 in 2008 and $8 in 2009.
1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company reviews identified intangible and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances are present, an impairment loss would be recognized if the sum of the expected future net cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the asset.
Foreign Currency Translation. The local foreign currency is the functional currency for each of our foreign operations. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates as of the applicable balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Adjustments resulting from translation are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Net gains and losses from foreign currency transactions were significant during 2004 and 2003 due to fluctuations in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar and Great Britain pound. We hedged a portion of our exposure and recorded the gains and losses from this activity in other income expense. Net gains and losses from foreign currency transactions were not significant in the other years presented.
Derivative Instruments. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS 133, which requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. We enter into derivative contracts, principally currency hedges, to limit the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the value of certain sales transactions. Additionally, we have previously entered interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert portions of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate. We do not attempt to speculate on the direction of currency rates nor interest rates. We take this conservative approach to protect against the risk of loss only. See Note 18 for a further discussion of Financial Instruments.
Warranty. We are a reseller of hardware and pass through to our customers the standard warranties provided by the hardware supplier. We warrant our application software products to perform in accordance with written user documentation and the agreements negotiated with our customers. Since we do not customize our applications software, software warranty costs are insignificant and expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 FAS109,Accounting for Income Taxes, which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with FAS No. 109, income tax expense includes 1 deferred tax expense, which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances, and 2 current tax expense, which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority. The primary difference between financial statement income and taxable income results from the use of diff
erent methods of computing depreciation, capitalized development costs, certain revenue recognition activities, other timing differences and the valuation of net operating loss carryforwards. Deferred taxes do not reflect temporary differences relating to our investment in foreign subsidiaries as these amounts have been deemed to be permanently invested. Estimating the deferred tax position on these amounts is not practical.
Revenue Recognition
Discovery Informatics Products and Support 
The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. Revenues from software license agreements are recognized when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph 8 of SOP 97-2: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2 delivery has occurred, 3 the fee is fixed or determinable, and 4 collectibility is probable.
The Company allocates revenues on perpetual software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of each element. The Company determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE. The Company limits its assessment of VSOE for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately by the Company. The Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple-element arrangements and determined that it has sufficient VSOE to allocate revenues to maintenance and support services, and training. The Company sells training
1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
separately and has established VSOE on this basis. VSOE for maintenance and support is determined based upon the renewal rates in contracts, which is based on a fixed percentage of license revenue. Accordingly, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery of the software using the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions. 
Software maintenance agreements provide technical support and the right to unspecified enhancements and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Post-contract customer support revenues on perpetual agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the support period generally one year, and training and other service revenues are recognized as the related services are provided. Any unrecognized portion of amounts paid in advance for licenses and services is recorded as deferred revenue.
Term licenses represent time-based license arrangements for one or multiple software products that are sold with maintenance and support for the term of the license arrangement. The Company does not have VSOE to determine fair value of the maintenance and support in term arrangements. The Company recognizes revenues from these bundled term licenses ratably over the license term, which is typically 1 to 3 years. 
Discovery Informatics Services
Included in discovery informatics services are contracts for software consulting as well as software development.
Discovery Informatics Services DIS represent contracts for the development and delivery of enterprise-wide customized software such as laboratory information systems or database integration projects. Technological feasibility exists on these software arrangements and they typically include installation at the customer site. We account for these arrangements in accordance with SOP 81-1, as required by SOP 97-2 since the contract to deliver software and installation requires significant production, modification or customization of software.
In applying the provisions of SOP 81-1 the percentage of completion is utilized. For contracts where customer approval of contractually required tasks must occur at each distinct milestone, and where amounts billable are indicative of progress-to-completion, we record revenues when a milestone has been met and accepted by the customer. For contracts without distinct milestones, we measure progress using the cost-to-cost method, which approximates progress towards completion.
Software Development SD projects are contractual arrangements with customers for use of Tripos software developers in an effort to develop a scientific software tool for use in drug discovery. The contractual arrangements are on a best efforts basis, and the customer is subject to billings on a time and materials basis. Accordingly, we record the related revenue when the time and costs are incurred at the stated contractual rates. 
Discovery Research Products and Services
Discovery research sales include sales of chemical compounds from 1 inventory, 2 long-term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer specifications, or 3 contracts to perform discovery research activities. 
Sales of chemical compounds from inventory are recorded upon delivery.
In accordance with SOP 81-1, sales derived from long-term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer specifications are recorded using the percentage of completion method as the compounds are delivered under the units of delivery method. The contract costs related to delivered compounds are recorded to cost of sales as the compounds are delivered and revenue is recognized.
Discovery research activities involve lead compound optimization projects, custom synthesis, and compound design. These contracts are generally on a best efforts basis and call for non-refundable contractual fees tied to time and materials. Accordingly, revenues under contracts of this type are recorded on a time and material basis. When contracts to perform discovery research activities require a specific deliverable, the direct and incremental contract costs are deferred. Revenue and the contract costs are then recorded upon delivery and acceptance.
1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Hardware Sales
Hardware sales are recorded upon delivery unless delivered in connection with a contractual arrangement involving term software licenses. When hardware is sold in conjunction with a term license, the entire contractual revenue amount is recognized ratably over the term software license period and the related hardware costs are deferred and recorded in cost of sales ratably over the same period.
Comprehensive Income. Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components revenue, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements. SFAS No. 130 requires that all components of comprehensive income, including net income, be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net income and other comprehensive income, including foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on investments, shall be reported, net of their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. 
The components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related tax, at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 are as follows 2004
2003 Foreign currency translation adjustments 1,629 1,315 Unrealized gains on marketable securities
96
83 Accumulated other comprehensive income 1,533 1,232 Stock-Based Compensation. At December 31, 2004, Tripos had the stock-based employee compensation plans described in Note 21. We account for stock option plans under the intrinsic value method as permitted under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under APB 25, generally no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of the options equal the fair value of the stock at the grant date.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation. Our stock option plans have fixed stock option awards grants that vest over a period of four years pro-rata.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Earnings Per Common and Dilutive Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and potential dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares may consist of outstanding stock options and the assumed conversion of the Series B Preferred shares for periods in which the Series B shares were outstanding. See Note 14 for additional information regarding earnings per share.
Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' balances to conform with the current year presentation.
New Accounting Pronouncements. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 151 Inventory Costs-an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 FAS 151. FAS 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage to require that these items be included as current-period charges and not included in overhead. In addition, FAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The provisions in FAS 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are in the process of evaluating the requirements of FAS 151 but do not expect the adoption of FAS 151 to have a significant effect on our financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share--Based Payment FAS 123R, which revises and replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Payment and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. FAS 123R requires the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations. The pro-forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. The provisions of FAS 123R are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FAS 123R, but because we are accounting for employee stock option grants in a footnote disclosure as permitted by SFAS No. 123, the adoption of FAS 123R will have an impact on our results of operations. See Note 1 Stock-Based Compensation
for an illustration of the historical effects of expensing stock options.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS No. 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FAS 109-2. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allows for a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer if certain criteria are met. The provisions of FAS 109-2 were effective immediately upon issuance. We do not expect that the adoption of FAS 109-2 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
2. Benefit Plan
In 1994, we established a defined contribution 401k Plan covering all U.S. employees who are at least 21 years of age. Employees may contribute to the plan up to 50% of their compensation, which is further limited by law. We match employee contributions for an amount up to 50% of the employee deferral limited to the first 6% of each employee compensation. Contributions made by the Company were $351 in 2004, $378 in 2003, and $409 in 2002.
3. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk have consisted principally of investments and trade receivables. We invest available cash in bank deposits, investment-grade securities, and short-term interest-producing investments, including government obligations and other money market instruments. We have adopted credit policies and standards to evaluate the risk associated with our sales and require collateral, such as letters of credit or bank guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. Our management believes that any risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the nature of the customers and distributors with which we do business.
4. Inventory
We maintain a physical inventory of chemical compound libraries in various states of completion. Costs associated with the manufacture of compounds are calculated using the standard cost method and are carried at the lower of cost standard cost method approximating FIFO or market. Compounds that are acquired from third parties are also carried at the lower of cost or market. In calculating the reserve for obsolescence, collections of compounds are reviewed for their age and cumulative sales trends, and if necessary, a reserve provision is made for each collection or library of compounds. If there is, in our opinion, a significant adverse deviation in sales trends for a specific compound collection or library, an additional reserve provision is taken. A portion of the inventory is used in discovery research projects. Depreciation of this inventory is recorded in the reserve for obsolescence over its 10-year expected useful life. Wor
k in process and finished goods inventory includes the accumulated cost of compounds in production or awaiting shipment to customers under discovery research or custom synthesis contracts. Inventory balances at December 31 are 2004

7. Lease Obligations
We lease certain office facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases with terms from one to ten years. The capital leases specifically pertain to the acquisition of certain laboratory and computer equipment totaling $9,299. The total accumulated amortization associated with equipment under capital leases was approximately $3,846 and $1,095 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The related amortization expense is included in depreciation expense. Rent expense under the operating leases was $1,118, $871 and $876 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Noncancelable future minimum lease commitments as of December 31, 2004 are: Year Operating Leases

8. Grants
In 2002, Tripos, Inc. and its U.K. subsidiary, Tripos Discovery Research Ltd. TDR, were awarded two grants related to the expansion of the chemistry laboratories in Bude, Cornwall. The U.K. Department of Trade and Industry DTI awarded GBP2,400 based on the creation of jobs in the region and capital investment. Additionally, the South West of England Regional Development Agency awarded GBP1,300 tied to costs to construct the laboratory. At December 31, 2002, TDR had met all criteria for the first installment of the DTI grant and was approved to receive a payment of GBP550 that was recorded in 2002. Approximately GBP99 of the payment was attributed to the reduction of expenses while the remainder was treated as a reduction in the cost of capital expenditures. During 2003, TDR achieved multiple thresholds under the South West of England Regional Development Agency grant and made claims of GBP1,300 which were recorded as reductions in the amounts of capital expenditures. In 2004,
the second installment of the DTI grant was approved and a payment was received for GBP990. Approximately GBP205 of the payment was attributed to reduction in expenses while the remaining GBP785 was recorded as a reduction of our capital expenditures. At December 31, 2004, GBP860 remains to be awarded if certain criteria are met. We must achieve agreed levels of hiring and capital expenditures in order to submit claims for funding under the respective grants. Should we fail to complete the project or not meet the hiring thresholds, we may not be entitled to the full amount of the grants. The grant from the DTI expires on December 31, 2006 if not claimed. Additionally, for a period of up to 24 months after our last draw under the grant program, we are obligated to repay portions or all of the grant money received if we eliminate jobs or exit the property. At this time, we do not anticipate reducing employment or vacating the property during the contingency period, therefore we have not recorded a liability f
or repayment of any grant proceeds.

561 1,709 422 In recent years, the U.S. entity had sufficient deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to the increased market value of its prior investment in shares of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to offset its loss carryforward as of December 31, 2002. In 2003, Tripos determined its cumulative deferred tax assets created primarily by prior year net operating losses were in excess of its then deferred tax liabilities. As a result, a valuation allowance was established as required under FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In 2004, additional valuation allowances were applied to the current year U.S. net operating loss. 
10. Income Taxes continued
There are $605 of tax benefits from stock option exercises with offsetting valuation allowances that upon realization will be credited to additional paid-in-capital. Under the new American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the carryforward period for foreign tax credits has been extended to 10 years. Therefore the foreign tax credits will expire in 2011 and 2012. RD credits generated before 1998 have a 15-year carryforward period and a 20-year period for credits arising after 1997. Therefore the RD credits will expire between 2011 and 2024.
Income tax payments for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $217, $4 and $61, respectively. Tripos' U.K. subsidiaries had group loss carryforwards at December 31, 2004, with a pre-tax value of approximately $12,184 that have no expiration date. Additionally, Tripos' U.S. entity had loss carryforwards of $4,889 on a pre-tax basis that expire in 19 years. At December 31, 2004, there were no undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. 
11. Long-term Debt
As of December 31, 2004, we had a credit agreement with LaSalle Bank for a $3,914 mortgage note for property with a book carrying value of $3,980. The mortgage is due to mature on December 2, 2005. Tripos also has a $6,000 one-year revolving line of credit agreement with LaSalle Bank. The line of credit is due to expire on April 19, 2005. Both credit agreements are collateralized by substantially all of our U.S. assets and stock pledges for each of the U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries. Payment of dividends to stockholders or the incurring of debt from other sources by Tripos, Inc. and its subsidiaries must be approved in advance by LaSalle Bank. The agreements also require us to meet certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage, minimum shareholders' equity, maximum capital expenditure excluding the chemistry laboratory expansion and an annual clean-down period of 30 consecutive days in which no borrowings are outstanding on the revolving credit facility. Tripos expects
to negotiate extensions to both agreements with LaSalle Bank prior to their expiration dates. 
The mortgage note under the credit agreement calls for even quarterly principal payments based on a twenty-year amortization schedule. Borrowings under the mortgage are subject to a variable interest rate at LIBOR plus 225%. An interest rate swap agreement was entered into that fixed the interest rate at 740% until April 30, 2003. Upon expiration of the interest swap, the Company allowed the interest rate on the mortgage loan to float. The $6,000 revolving line of credit under the credit agreement required quarterly interest-only payments with any remaining borrowings due at the end of the agreement period. The line of credit carries a commitment fee of 3/8% of the unused portion of the line. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at variable rates tied to LIBOR or the bank prime rate. We averaged $2,117 of outstanding borrowings during 2004 primarily to fund the laboratory expansion in the U.K. The weighted average interest rate on line of credit borrowings was 4.
14% in 2004.
On October 16, 2003, we entered into an Interim Revolver Facility with LaSalle Bank in the amount of $4,000. Borrowings under the Interim Revolver were subject to variable interest rates based on LIBOR plus 30% or prime plus 10%. The outstanding balance on the Interim Revolver Facility was repaid in full on February 3, 2004 and this facility is now expired. 
Short-term debt obligations were December 31, 2004

Interest expense incurred, net of capitalized interest, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $265, $515, and $376, respectively, while total interest payments were $1,116, $769, and $429, respectively.
12. Segment Information 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131, Segment Information SFAS 131 to amend the requirements for public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments in annual financial statements and selected information about operating segments in interim reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments, as defined in SFAS 131, are components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by our management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company operates in two industry segments, Discovery Informatics and Discovery Research. The Company Discovery Informatics segment designs and sells software suites that provide computer-aided molecular modeling and visualization, visual screening, combinatorial library design, d
ata storage and analysis, and structure-activity relationships to customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and related life science fields of research. The Company Discovery Research provides drug discovery services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on proprietary combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening and Tripos' ChemspaceTM and Lead HoppingTM technologies.

22,740 Most of our services are provided on an integrated worldwide basis. Because of the integration of U.S. and non-U.S. services, it is not practical to separate precisely the U.S.-oriented services from services resulting from operations outside the United States and performed for customers outside the United States; accordingly, the separation set forth in the preceding table is based upon internal allocations, which involve certain management judgments. Net sales and long-lived assets in the preceding table are attributable to the country or territory in which our subsidiaries or distributors are located.
13. Time-based Software License Arrangements
Certain time-based software license arrangements are covered by non-cancelable agreements whose terms range from one to five years. The typical term of the contracts is three years. Revenue from these time-based software license arrangements is recognized ratably over the agreed term. The following table shows the amount of future revenues to be recognized from these non-cancelable arrangements as of December 31, 2004. Revenues to be recognized in Amount 2005 13,422 2006

15. Investment in Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
During the period from 1997 through 1999, we invested in the start up of Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Arena, a San Diego, California biotechnology company. Our investment in Arena totaled $3,200. In July of 2000, Arena successfully completed its initial public offering IPO of common stock on the NASDAQ market. During June 2001, Arena completed a secondary offering of additional shares of common stock. We participated in the offering by selling 100 shares and realizing a pre-tax gain of $2,387. During 2002 we sold 619 shares under a controlled sale program realizing a pre-tax gain of $3,560. Again in 2003, we sold 1,266 shares of Arena and realized a pre-tax gain of $6,659. Finally, in 2004 we sold our remaining 31 shares, realizing a pre-tax gain of $144.
16. Investment in Signase, Inc.
During 2001 and 2002 Tripos made in-kind contributions of chemical compounds in exchange for shares of Signase, Inc., a Texas-based biotechnology company that researches cancer therapeutics. The transactions were recorded as an increase in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and sales of chemical compounds. Valuation of the shares received was consistent with recent equity placements of similar shares to other investors by Signase. The $500 sales value of the chemical compounds was consistent with average market values received in comparable transactions from other customers for similar volumes of compounds sold from our existing inventory. 
Early in 2003, Signase advised its shareholders of its intent to seek additional financing at rates below those of the original investors. We determined this reduced level of market value to be other than temporary and as a result, wrote down our investment to approximate the then current offering price. Our total in-kind investment was $552 prior to the write-down of $405 in 2002, leaving a carrying value of $150. Tripos took a further write-down of the remainder of its investment in Signase, $150, as of March 31, 2003 after receiving information from Signase that attempts to raise capital were unsuccessful and that the company may be liquidated. There has been no further developments on the status of the company or our investment. 
17. Investment in A.M. Pappas Life Science Ventures II Fund.
Since 2001, we have invested in the A.M. Pappas Life Science Ventures II fund administered by A.M. Pappas. This fund invests in new and developing companies in the life science sector. Our investment commitment of $2,500 represents approximately 22% of the total capital of the fund. As of December 31, 2004 we had invested $1,750 or 70% of our total commitment. In 2004 we received a distribution of 33 shares of NuVasive, Inc. from the fund manager upon NuVasive initial public offering. The current value of these shares, $341, is recorded as marketable securities. 
The fund records investment impairments when identified, for which we recognize our pro-rata share of such impairments. In 2004 and 2003, the fund managers determined that certain investments were impaired, and we recorded our pro-rata share of the fund investment impairments, totaling $58 and $110, respectively. 
18. Financial Instruments
Periodically, we enter into foreign currency hedge transactions to protect us from unfavorable changes in the exchange rate of currencies on certain customer contracts. For transactions qualifying as effective hedges, as determined using either dollar offset method or regression methods, we record these foreign exchange contracts at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. These gains or losses are recognized in income in the period in which the transactions being hedged are recognized. To the extent any contract is not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged transaction, the ineffective portion of the contract is immediately recognized in income.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative will continue to be carried in the statement of financial position at its fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to be carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.
For transactions that do not qualify as effective hedges, there will be a gain or loss reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the change in currency rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts are included in other income expense net. The counter-party to these foreign currency hedge contracts is LaSalle N.A. At December 31, 2004 there were no foreign currency future contracts in place. At December 31, 2003, several foreign currency futures contracts were in place that did not qualify as effective hedges. These futures contracts were entered into to fix the value of GBP44 million to U.S. dollars. The fair value of these contracts, $929, is included in Marketable Securities.

On February 8, 2002, we entered into a marketing alliance agreement with Accenture LLP intended to market and sell a fully integrated solution to automate drug discovery operations of the largest global pharmaceutical companies. As part of this arrangement, we issued 33 shares of common stock, valued at $10 million, to Accenture upon entry into this arrangement. This upfront fee paid to Accenture was in consideration of the marketing effort to be expended by Accenture over the term of the relationship. The fee covered the development of joint marketing materials, a joint product demo presentation, and marketing time and effort on behalf of Accenture. We applied EITF 96-18 Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. In applying EITF 96-18, since the $10 million of our stock was granted to Accenture at the inception of the contract in exchange for three years of marketing services and
the stock is non-forfeitable and fully vested we determined that the date of issuance of the equity securities is the appropriate measurement date. Accordingly, we recorded the equity issuance and an Other Asset at the contract inception date, based on the fair value of the stock issued. Performance of the services is required over the contractual term, therefore we amortize the Other Asset ratably over the contractual term as a sales and marketing expense. Total expense recorded in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 related to the arrangement was $265, $265 and $447, respectively. At this time, we do not expect any future fixed compensation to Accenture, however, we do expect that should certain collaborative engagements be successful, Tripos may pay performance-based compensation to Accenture.
20. Loss Contracts
In March 2004, we announced the completion of a significant milestone in our collaboration with Schering AG. Schering accepted Tripos' AUSPYX data cartridge for Oracle as the foundation of their Enterprise Chemical Information Management System ECIMS. Having successfully completed this milestone, the two companies were in talks regarding the specifications and financial arrangements necessary to complete the development and deployment of ECIMS. This required a scope change to the then existing contract. Because these discussions were not finalized, Tripos recorded a charge in 2003 for the estimated project costs in excess of the revenues that it expected under the then current contract terms. In calculating the amount of the charge to be recorded, Tripos assumed that the project would not continue past delivery and rollout of the production system in mid-2004. This assumption led to a corresponding reduction of approximately $802 in the total revenues avail
able under the contract through the expected mid-2004 delivery. In addition, we recorded a charge of approximately $813 for the estimated project costs in excess of the revenues expected under the previous contract terms. In calculating the amount of the charge to be recorded, Tripos was required to utilize the then existing contract terms, and could not assume that the project would continue past delivery and rollout of the production system in mid-2004. Tripos was required to accrue these excess costs so that its year-end financial statements fairly reflected the project status as of December 31, 2003. The negotiations were completed in mid-2004 and the project is progressing to the agreed schedule. Under the revised financial terms, we expect to receive payments equal to our costs to complete the project and therefore are reflecting no margin. 
Included in the costs of discovery informatics for 2002 are the effects of a delayed milestone and subsequent restructuring of a contract with another customer. We expensed the anticipated costs to complete the delayed milestone in the second quarter of 2002 when it became apparent that we would incur a loss on that specific milestone. Tripos determined that the corrections and additional work required to successfully deliver the milestone would be substantial enough to cause the Company to experience a loss of $829 over the entire remaining contract period, primarily driven by the overages associated with completion of this milestone. In accordance with SOP 81-1, Tripos accrued the expected loss to complete this contract. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the delayed milestone was successfully delivered. Further, due to the complexities of the work plan and the losses incurred through the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company and the custome
r agreed to an amendment to the overall contract. Tripos' remaining effort under the contract was then reduced to a single milestone to be completed over the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years for a revised fixed fee. Tripos assessed the effort required to complete all its obligations under the remainder of the amended contract and determined that an additional $206 loss would be incurred over the remaining periods. Again, the Company accrued the total expected loss to complete the contract. Tripos successfully delivered the final versions of the software in the fourth quarter of 2004 and recovered a modest portion of the previously recorded losses. 
21. Stock-based Compensation Plans
In 2002, we adopted the 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan that allows eligible employees to purchase stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the enrollment date or exercise date as defined by the plan. Pursuant to the plan, employee purchases are limited to 10% of annual compensation. The plan originally had 250 shares reserved for issuance. In 2004 the shareholders approved an increase in the reserve of 450 shares. The plan is in effect for ten years unless terminated or amended sooner by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2004, 250 shares have been purchased under this plan leaving 450 shares available for issuance. 
In 1994, we adopted the 1994 Stock Option Plan that is administered by the Compensation Committee and provides for incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options and stock purchase rights to be granted to our employees and consultants. Pursuant to the plan, incentive stock options can be exercised at a price which is not less than the fair value of the stock on the grant date, and non-statutory stock options and stock purchase rights can be exercised at a price which is determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the period over which options and rights can be exercised. Options vest at the rate of 25% on the first anniversary of each grant and 1/48th per month over the next three years. All options granted have 10-year terms. The plan, which was amended in 2001 to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance from 2,560 to 2,960, was in effect for ten years from the date of inception and expired during 20
04. The outstanding 1,366 options granted prior to the expiration of the plan will remain outstanding until their exercise, expiration or forfeiture. 
In 1994, we adopted the 1994 Director Option Plan that provides for non-statutory stock options to be granted to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. Options vest in 25% increments on the anniversary of date of grant. The plan, which was amended in 2002 to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance from 480 to 600, was in effect for ten years from the date of inception and expired during 2004. 
21. Stock-based Compensation Plans continued
This plan was amended in 2001 to allow for discretionary grants of options. The outstanding 417 options granted prior to the expiration of the plan will remain outstanding until their exercise, expiration or forfeiture.
Pro-forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS 123 and has been determined as if we had accounted for employee and director stock options under the fair value method of that Statement see Note 1. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates ranging from 146% to 443% for 2004, 110% to 423% for 2003 and 213% to 539% for 2002; volatility factor of 090 for 2004, 097 for 2003 and 098 for 2002; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 53 years for 2004, 2003 and 2002. For the Tripos Employee Stock Purchase Plan, compensation expense was also estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rates ranging from 129% to 457% for 2004, 110% to 423% for 2003 and 213% to 539% for 2002; volatility factors of 090 for 2004, 097 f
or 2003 and 098 for 2002; and a weighted average expected life of the option of 6 months. For all years presented, we used a dividend rate of zero.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our employee and director stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee and director stock options.

Each right represents the right to purchase one preferred share of stock. These rights can be exercised only if certain events occur, which include, among other things, when a beneficial owner our common stock acquires a total of 20% or more of our outstanding common stock.
22. Subsequent Event
On December 22, 2004 we announced an agreement to acquire Optive Research, Inc., a software company offering discovery informatics products complementary with our own to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The transaction was completed on January 5, 2005 for a total purchase price of $7,933. The acquisition was accomplished through a merger of a newlyformed, whollyowned subsidiary of Tripos with and into Optive, with Optive surviving as our subsidiary. Under the terms of the agreement, we issued 600 shares of our common stock with a value of $3,183 based on the market value on January 4, 2005 a portion of which is contractually restricted and $4,750 in cash to Optive stockholders. The cash portion was funded by a group of new investors through the issuance of $3,500 of subordinated debt bearing an interest rate of 1142%, 112 shares of common stock with a negotiated value of $500, and warrants to purchase 156 shares of common stock at $448 per share.
23. Legal Proceedings
On or about July 24, 2003, the Company and two of its executive officers, Dr. John P. McAlister and Mr. B. James Rubin, were sued in federal district court in St. Louis, Missouri on behalf of purchasers of the Company common stock during the first half of 2002. The consolidated class action complaint alleged that statements made by the Company in press releases and other public disclosures contained materially false and misleading information in violation of the federal securities laws. 
On or about May 5, 2004, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the Company common stock between February 9, 2000 and July 1, 2002 the Class Period. The second amended complaint generally alleges that, during the Class Period, defendants made false or misleading statements of material fact about the Company prospects and failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles in violation of the federal securities laws. The second amended complaint also names Ernst Young LLP as a co-defendant. In August 2004, the Company and the individual defendants and Ernst Young filed motions to dismiss the second amended complaint. The amount of damages being sought is unspecified at this time. Although the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims alleged against it in this action, it is too early in the litigation to provide an accurate assessment of the likelihood or the extent of any liability arising 
from this matter.
