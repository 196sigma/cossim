Notes to Consolidated Financial  33                    25     MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in INTERNAL CONTROL INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of
December 31, 2005, the Company internal control over financial reporting is
effective based on those criteria.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm which also audited the Company
consolidated financial statements. Ernst & Young attestation report on
management assessment of the Company internal control over financial
reporting appears on page 28 hereof. s/  James F. Wright              /s/ Anthony F. Crudele

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS
TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Tractor
Supply Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Tractor Supply
Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Tractor Supply Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Tractor Supply Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
Tractor Supply Company as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 and our report
dated March 13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.                         /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Nashville, Tennessee

TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply
Company as of December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply
Company at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
As discussed in Note 17 to the financial statements, in fiscal 2003 the Company
changed its method of accounting for certain consideration received from
vendors.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Tractor Supply
Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.                         /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

The Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the
United States. The Company is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of
recreational farmers and ranchers and serving the maintenance needs of those who
enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Stores are
located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
At December 31, 2005 the Company operated 595 retail farm and ranch stores in 37
states including one store in British Columbia.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday
of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that
fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of 53 weeks
while the fiscal years ended December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003 consist of
52 weeks.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 2005 presentation.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently
requires estimates and assumptions by management that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the
following key financial statement areas     INVENTORY VALUATION
The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by
evaluating turn rates and overall inventory levels. Potentially excess
quantities are identified through the application of benchmark turn
targets and historical sales experience. Further, exposure to inadequate
realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross
margin achievement and markdown experience, in combination with all
merchandising initiatives. The estimated reserve is based on
management current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales
trends and historical experience relating to the sale of the potentially
excess and/or slow-moving inventory. Management does not believe the
Company merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of
obsolescence in the near-term, and management has the ability to adjust
purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general
economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns
could result in the need for additional reserves.
The Company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventory between
physical inventory counts by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage
experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such
assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent
individual store experiences.                    33          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     The Company receives funding from its vendors for promotion of the
Company brand as well as the sale of their products. Vendor funding is
accounted for as a discount on the purchase price of inventories and is
recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as inventory is sold.
The amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial
guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with
applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor
funding is based on management current knowledge with respect to
inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as
planned new store openings and relocations. Although management believes
it has the ability to reasonably estimate its purchase volume and
related vendor funding, it is possible that actual results could
significantly differ from the estimated amounts.
SALES RETURNS
The Company generally honors customer refunds within 30 days of the
original purchase, with the supporting receipt. However, the Company
also has a satisfaction guaranteed policy, such that if customers are
not satisfied, store employees are authorized, at their discretion, to
offer to repair or exchange the product, or to offer store credits or
refunds, irrespective of when the product was purchased. The Company
estimates its reserve for likely customer returns based on the average
refund experience in relation to sales for the related period. Due to
the seasonality of the Company sales, the refund experience can vary,
depending on the fiscal quarter of measurement.
SELF-INSURANCE
The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to workers'
compensation, medical and general liability claims. However, the Company
has stop-loss limits and umbrella insurance coverage for certain risk
exposures subject to specified limits. Self-insurance claims filed and
claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management
estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using
actuarial reports and assumptions followed in the insurance industry and
historical experience. Although management believes it has the ability
to adequately record estimated losses related to claims, it is possible
that actual results could significantly differ from recorded
self-insurance liabilities.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when sales transactions occur and customers take
possession of the merchandise. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns
is provided in the period during which the related sales are recorded. Revenues
from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized when the cards are
redeemed. Residual amounts related to the expiration of gift cards are
immaterial.
CREDIT CARDS/ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Sales generated through the Company private label credit cards are not
reflected as accounts receivable. Under an agreement with Citi Commerce
Solutions, a division of Citigroup Citigroup, consumer and business credit
is extended directly to customers by Citigroup. All credit program and related
services are performed and controlled directly by Citigroup.
PRE-OPENING COSTS
Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with start-up for store and
distribution center activities are expensed as incurred.                    34          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STORE CLOSING COSTS
The Company recognizes store closing costs in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, SFAS 146 which requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
when the liability is incurred.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments
due from banks for customer credit card transactions process within 24-48 hours
and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term receivables and payables and long-term debt instruments, including
capital leases. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables
and trade payables equal current fair value. The terms of the Company
revolving credit agreement the Credit Agreement include variable interest
rates, which approximate current market rates.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company complies with SFAS Nos. 133, 137, and 138 collectively SFAS 133
pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133
requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments in the balance
sheet at fair value.
INVENTORIES
The value of the Company inventories is determined using the lower of last-in,
first-out LIFO cost or market. Inventories are not in excess of market value.
Quarterly inventory determinations under LIFO are based on assumptions as to
projected inventory levels at the end of the fiscal year, sales for the year and
the rate of inflation/deflation for the year. If the first-in, first-out FIFO
method of accounting for inventory had been used, inventories would have been
approximately $14,168,000 and $9,619,000 higher than reported at December 31,
2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively.
VENDOR CONCENTRATION
Approximately 130 vendors accounted for 80% of the Company purchases for
fiscal 2005, with one vendor representing 13% of purchases.
FREIGHT COSTS
The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in
connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as
a component of the overall cost of inventories and recognized as a cost of
merchandise sold as inventory is sold.
WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS
Costs incurred at the Company distribution centers for receiving, warehousing
and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred. These costs are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
statements of income at the time the costs are incurred.                    35          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Improvements
to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the initial
term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is lesser.
Leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are amortized over the term
of the lease including the first renewal option, if the renewal is reasonably
assured or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is lesser. The
following estimated useful lives are generally applied                                 LIFE
Buildings                      30 - 35 years
Leasehold and building improvements         5 - 15 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment          5 - 10 years
Computer software and hardware            3 - 5 years
LEASES
Assets under capital leases are amortized in accordance with the Company
normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless
of renewal options, if shorter, and the charge to earnings is included in
depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain leases include rent increases during the initial lease term. For these
leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease which includes the pre-opening period of
construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement and records the
difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts paid as a rent
liability.
The Company occasionally receives reimbursements from landlords to be used
towards construction of improvements to the store the Company intends to lease.
The reimbursement is primarily for the purpose of performing work required to
divide a much larger location into smaller segments, one of which the Company
will use for its store. This work could include the addition of demising walls,
separation of plumbing, utilities, electric work, entrances front and back and
other work as required. Leasehold improvements are recorded at their gross costs
including items reimbursed by landlords. The reimbursements are amortized on a
straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the initial lease term.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company applies the
provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets to assets held for sale. Impairments on long-lived assets are
valued on an asset by asset basis and are recognized by writing down the related
assets to their fair value less costs to sell, as appropriate, when the
criteria have been met for the asset to be classified as held for sale or
disposal.
GOODWILL
In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are
measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an
impairment exists.                    36          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper
circulars, television and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper
advertisements and other promotions. Costs are expensed when incurred with the
exception of television advertising and circular and direct mail promotions,
which are expensed upon first showing. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003 were approximately $47,369,000, $42,198,000 and $38,235,000
respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, whereby
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation
adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders'
equity. The assets and liabilities of the Company store in British Columbia,
which was acquired as part of the acquisition of the assets of Del, are
translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenues and expense items are
translated at average rates for the period.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value
method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
Interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized for fixed
option plans because the exercise price of employee stock options equal or
exceed the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant.
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payments. See Note 2.
The following table represents the effect on net income and earnings per share
if the Company had applied the fair value based method and recognition
provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation                          2005      2004      2003

$    200  $    149  $    133 As required, the pro forma disclosures above include options granted since
January 1, 1995. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of stock-based compensation plans and other options is amortized to expense
primarily over the vesting period. For options with graded vesting, expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.                    37          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share, has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock-based
compensation plans and other stock options under the fair value method of SFAS
123. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
a modified BLACK-SCHOLES option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants under the fixed option plans                              2005      2004      2003

The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share EPS on the
face of the income statement. As provided by SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share,
basic EPS is calculated as income available to common stockholders divided by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
is calculated using the treasury stock method for options.
NOTE 2 - SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS
123 and supersedes APB 25. Among other items, SFAS 123R eliminates the use of
the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the
cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments
based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative under the new standard. The Company adopted SFAS 123R on
January 1, 2006, as required.
SFAS 123R permits the use of either a modified prospective method, or a
modified retrospective method. Under the modified prospective method,
compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all share-based
payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for
all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R. Under the
modified retrospective method, the requirements are the same as under the
modified prospective method, but also permit the restatement of prior period
financial statements based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS
123.
The Company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model i.e.
BLACK-SCHOLES to measure the fair value of stock options granted to Employees.
While SFAS 123R permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard
also permits the use of a more complex binomial, or lattice model. Based upon
research done by the Company on the alternative models available to value option
grants, and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to
be issued in the future, the Company has determined that it will continue to use
a modified BLACK-SCHOLES model for option valuation.
SFAS 123R includes several modifications to the presentation of income taxes in
the financial statements. The expense for certain types of option grants is only
deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place,
which could cause variability in the Company effective tax rates recorded
throughout the year. SFAS 123R does not allow companies to predict when these
taxable events will take place. Furthermore, it requires that the benefits
associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current rules. This requirement will reduce net operating cash
flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date.
These future amounts cannot be estimated, because they depend on, among other
things, when employees exercise stock options. The amount of operating cash
flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions, as shown in                    38          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS the Company Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, were $125 million, $87
million, and $43 million, respectively, for 2005, 2004, and 2003.
The Company will utilize the modified prospective method. The Company expects
that the adoption of SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, will reduce fiscal 2006 net
earnings by approximately $70 million $44 million after tax. See Note 14 for
further information on the Company stock-based compensation plans.
NOTE 3 - ACQUISITION OF DEL'S FARM SUPPLY On November 10, 2005, the Company acquired the assets of privately-held Del
Farm Supply, Inc. Del for $176 million and the assumption of certain
liabilities. Based in Lakewood, Washington, Del operates 16 stores, primarily
in the Pacific Northwest, that offer a wide selection of products tailored to
those who enjoy the rural lifestyle. Del specializes in the equine, animal and
pet category. Historical pro forma results of operations have not been provided
due to the overall immateriality of these operations to the consolidated results
of operations. The purchase price was preliminarily allocated as follows in
thousands         Inventory.  $  4,300
Current assets.      803
Fixed assets.     1,500
Goodwill.    12,400
Current liabilities.    1,400
$  17,603
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired were estimated at
December 31, 2005 due to the time it takes to obtain pertinent information to
finalize the acquired company balance sheet frequently with implications for
the price of the acquisition. Upon completion of the Company procedures, the
initial estimates may be revised by immaterial amounts. The resulting goodwill
of $124 million is deductible for income tax purposes.
NOTE 4 - CREDIT AGREEMENT In August 2002, the Company entered into a credit agreement with Bank of
America, N.A., as agent for a lender group the Credit Agreement, whereby the
Company is permitted to borrow up to $155 million. The Credit Agreement was
subsequently amended on January 28, 2004 and September 30, 2004. Both amendments
included changes to certain financial covenants, primarily to provide
flexibility for capital expenditures, and extended the maturity to February 27,
2008. The outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement totaled $82 million
at December 31, 2005 and $323 million at December 25, 2004. The balance of
funds available under the Credit Agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up
to $50 million for letters of credit, of which $121 million and $127 million
were outstanding at December 31, 2005 and December 25, 2004, respectively. These
letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory. The
Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank base rate 725% at
December 31, 2005 or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR 439% at
December 31, 2005 plus an additional amount ranging from 075% to 15% per
annum, adjusted quarterly based on Company performance 075% at December 31,
2005. The Company is also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment
fee ranging from 020% to 035% per annum 020% at December 31, 2005 and
adjusted quarterly based on Company performance, on the average daily unused
portion of the credit line. There are no compensating balance requirements
associated with the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional
indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees,
investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with
subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. In addition, the Company must comply with
certain quarterly restrictions based on a rolling four-quarters basis
regarding net worth, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage, current ratio
requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures. The Company was in
compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005.                    39          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 5 - OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT In June 1998, the Company entered into an unsecured loan agreement the Loan
Agreement and term note the Term Note pursuant to which the Company
borrowed $15 million. There were no compensating balance requirements associated
with the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement and Term Note matured in November
2003 and were paid in full.
NOTE 6 - LEASES The Company leases the majority of its office space and most of its retail store
locations, transportation equipment and other equipment under various
noncancellable operating leases. The leases have varying terms and expire at
various dates through 2029 and 2021 for capital leases and operating leases,
respectively. Store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15
years, with two to four renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at the
Company option. Some leases require the payment of contingent rent that is
based upon store sales above agreed upon sales levels for the year. The sales
levels vary for each store and are established in the lease agreements.
Generally, most of the leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs.
Total rent expense for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $83,266,000 67,960,000 and $59,869,000 respectively. Total contingent rent expense for
fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 was insignificant.
Future minimum payments, by year and in the aggregate, under leases with initial
or remaining terms of one year or more consist of the following in thousands                                 CAPITAL   OPERATING

NOTE 7 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS During fiscal 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as
a means of managing its interest rate exposure. This agreement, which matured in
November 2003, had the effect of converting certain of the Company variable
rate obligations to fixed rate obligations.
The Company complies with SFAS 133 and recognized the fair value of the interest
rate swap in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company regularly adjusted the
carrying value of the interest rate swap to reflect its current fair                    40          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS value. The related gain or loss on the swap was deferred in stockholders' equity
as a component of comprehensive income to the extent that the swap was an
effective hedge. The deferred gain or loss was recognized in income in the
period in which the related interest rate payments being hedged were recognized
as an expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest
rate swap contract did not perfectly offset the change in the interest rate
payments being hedged, the ineffective portion was immediately recognized as an
expense. Net amounts paid or received were reflected as adjustments to interest
expense.

ASSOCIATE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The Company provides an Associate Stock Purchase Plan the ASPP whereby
eligible employees of the Company have the opportunity to purchase, through
payroll deductions, shares of common stock of the Company at a 15% discount.
Pursuant to the terms of the ASPP, the Company issued 42,065, 41,282 and 52,900
shares of common stock in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The total
cost to the Company of the 15% discount was approximately $247,000, $220,000 and
$140,000 in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
NOTE 15 - CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION
The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary
course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, management expects
these matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any estimated loss
related to such matters has been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to
the extent probable and reasonably estimable. It is possible, however, that
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could
be materially affected by changes in circumstances relating to these
proceedings.
In July 2004, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the
Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee by the Hawaii Laborers Pension
Plan against each of the Company directors, certain of its officers and one
former director. The Company was named as a nominal defendant. On September 17,
2004, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. On October 8, 2004, the Company
moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to make a pre-suit demand on
the Board of Directors. On December 3, 2004, the Court granted the Company
motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be
dismissed without prejudice. On February 17, 2005, the Court entered an order
denying a motion by the plaintiff to alter or amend the December 3, 2004 order
and judgment dismissing the amended complaint. On March 18, 2005, the plaintiff
appealed the order to the Tennessee Court of Appeals. On October 3, 2005,
plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and on October 19, 2005, the
Tennessee Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal.
SALES TAX COMPLIANCE
A portion of the Company sales are with tax-exempt customers. The Company
obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt
transaction. Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will
audit the Company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The
business activities of the Company customers and the intended use of the
unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex                    46          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that the
Company could be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance.
While the Company believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its
customers and endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax
regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company, upon final completion
of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed
exemptions. Management believes it has adequately provided for such liability
based on known assessments and expected settlements.
NOTE 16 - MOVE OF CORPORATE FACILITY In July 2004, the Company relocated its existing Store Support Center to
consolidate multiple headquarter facilities within one facility. The Company
recognized incremental after-tax costs of approximately $21 million primarily
related to remaining facility and technology lease obligations and other moving
costs.
NOTE 17 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16 EITF 02-16 provides guidance for
the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration
given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor
products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor products. The EITF
concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a
decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the
related inventories are sold, unless specific criteria are met qualifying the
consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific, identifiable
incremental costs. Prior to adopting this pronouncement, the Company classified
all vendor-provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling, general
and administrative expenses.
The effect of applying the consensus of EITF 02-16 on prior-period financial
statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income.
Thus, the Company has reported the adoption of EITF 02-16 as a cumulative effect
adjustment in accordance with APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS
No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements and as
permitted by EITF 02-16. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company
recognized a charge against net income of $3,053,000 $1,888,000 net of income
taxes, that resulted from the cumulative effect on prior years.
NOTE 18 - IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the FASB published Statement No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment. The impact of this Statement on the Company financial
position and operations has been discussed in Note 2.
In November of 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 SFAS 151. The purpose of this statement
is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and waste material. ARB No. 43 stated that under some
circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they are required to be
treated as current period costs. SFAS 151 requires that these costs be treated
as current period costs regardless if they meet the criteria of so abnormal.
The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Adoption of SFAS 151 on
January 1, 2006 did not have a material impact on the Company results of
operations or financial position.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary
Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 SFAS 153. SFAS 153 is based on
the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on
the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 was effective for nonmonetary
asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning with the third quarter of
2005, with earlier application permitted. Adoption of SFAS 153 did not have a
material impact on the Company results of operations or financial position.                    47 Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
