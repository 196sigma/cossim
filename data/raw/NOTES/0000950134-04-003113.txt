AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Transmeta Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Transmeta Corporation as of December31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2003.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Transmeta Corporation at
December31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Overview   
The Company Transmeta designs, develops and sells highly
efficient x86-compatible software-based microprocessors. We
believe that our microprocessors deliver a compelling balance of
low power consumption, high performance, low cost and small
size. These advantages are valuable to a broad range of
computing platforms, especially battery-operated mobile devices
and applications that need high performance, low power
consumption and low heat generation. Such platforms include
notebook computers, ultra-personal computers, or UPCs, tablet
PCs, thin clients, blade servers and embedded computers. Some of
these platforms provide types of computer configurations that
may reduce the total cost of ownership by reducing maintenance
and support costs or the total number of computing platforms
that must be supported in an enterprise. Transmeta was incorporated in California as
Transmeta Corporation on March3, 1995. Effective
October26, 2000, Transmeta reincorporated as a Delaware
corporation.   
Fiscal Year Transmetas fiscal year ends on the last
Friday in December. For ease of presentation, the accompanying
financial statements have been shown as ending on
December31 and calendar quarter ends for all annual and
quarterly financial statement captions. Fiscal years 2003, 2002
and 2001 consisted of 52weeks each and ended on
December26, December27 and December28,
respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the financial statements of Transmeta and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The critical accounting policies that require management
judgment and estimates include license revenue recognition,
inventory valuations, long-lived and intangible asset
valuations, restructuring charges and loss contingencies.   
Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable.
Substantially all of the Companys cash equivalents are
invested in highly liquid money market funds and commercial
securities with high-quality financial institutions in the
United States. Short-term investments consist of
U.S.government and commercial bonds and notes. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, maintains
an allowance for potential credit losses and does not generally
require collateral.   
Supplier Concentrations The Company depends on a single or limited number
of outside contractors to fabricate, assemble and test its
semiconductor devices. While the Company seeks to maintain a
sufficient level of supply and endeavors to maintain ongoing
communications with suppliers to guard against interruptions or
cessation of supply, business and results of operations could be
adversely affected by a stoppage or delay of supply from these
vendors. 49 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from products sold
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is
fixed or determinable, shipment is made and collectibility is
reasonably assured. The Company accrues for estimated sales
returns, and other allowances at the time of shipment. Certain
of the Companys product sales are made to distributors
under agreements allowing for price protection and/or right of
return on unsold products. The Company defers recognition of
revenue on these sales until the distributors sell the products.
The Company may also sell certain products with End of
Life status to its distributors under special arrangements
without price protection or return privileges for which revenue
is recognized upon transfer of title, typically upon shipment. The Company enters into license agreements, some
of which may contain multiple elements, including technology
license and support services, or non-standard terms and
conditions. As a result, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force EITFIssue No00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables and the Securities
and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin
No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, significant interpretation on these agreements
is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting,
including whether deliverables specified in a multiple element
arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting
for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the price
should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to
recognize revenue for each element. The Company recognizes
revenue from license agreements when earned, which generally
occurs when agreed-upon deliverables are provided, or milestones
are met and confirmed by licensees and relative fair values of
multiple elements can be determined. Additionally, license
revenues are recognized only if payments received are
non-refundable and not subject to any future performance
obligation by the Company.   
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are expensed as
incurred and included in cost of revenue in the Companys
results of operations.   
Comprehensive Loss Net comprehensive loss includes the
Companys net loss, as well as accumulated comprehensive
income/loss on available-for-sale investments and foreign
currency translation adjustments. Net comprehensive loss for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
is as follows

Cash Equivalents and Short-term
Investments Highly liquid debt securities with insignificant
interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or
less are classified as cash equivalents. Debt securities with
maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities
less than one year are available-for-sale and are classified as
short-term investments. Securities with maturity dates greater
than one year are also classified as short-term investments as
they are considered to be available-for-sale securities. All of Transmetas short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale as of the balance sheet
dates presented and, accordingly, are reported at fair value
with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income/loss in
stockholders equity. Fair values of cash 50 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued equivalents approximated original cost due to the
short period of time to maturity. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. Realized gains or
losses and declines in value, if any, judged to be other than
temporary on available-for-sale securities are reported in
interest income or expense.   
Fair Values of Financial
Instruments The fair values of Transmetas cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accounts payable
and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying values due to
the short-term nature of those instruments. The fair values of short-term and long-term
capital lease obligations are based on interest rates inherent
on leasing contracts. The carrying values of these obligations
approximate their respective fair values.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
first-in, first-out or market. Write-downs to reduce the
carrying value of excess and obsolete, slow moving and
non-usable inventory to net realizable value are charged to cost
of revenue.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization have been provided on the
straight-line method over the related assets estimated
useful life ranging from three to five years. Leasehold
improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the
related assets estimated useful life or the remaining
lease term.   
Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible
Assets Transmetas accounting policy related to the
valuation and impairment of long-lived assets is in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards
FASBStatement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets. In accordance with our policy, at
the end of each accounting period we evaluate our long-lived and
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived
assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be
held and used is determined by comparing the carrying amount of
an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is
considered to be impaired and the impairment charge recognized
is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.   
Research and Development Costs to develop Transmetas products are
expensed as incurred in accordance with the FASBs SFAS 2,
Accounting for Research and Development Costs, which
establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and
development costs.   
Income Taxes Transmeta accounts for income taxes in accordance
with the FASBs SFAS109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires the use of the liability method in
accounting for income taxes. Under SFAS109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured based on differences between
the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when
differences are expected to reverse.   
Product Warranty Transmeta typically provides a warranty that
includes factory repair services or replacement as needed for
replacement parts on its products for a period of one year from
shipment. Transmeta records a provision for 51 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued estimated warranty costs upon shipment of its
products. Warranty costs have been within managements
expectations to date and have not been material. The Company generally sells products with a
limited indemnification of customers against intellectual
property infringement claims related to the Companys
products. The Companys policy is to accrue for known
indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be
reasonably estimated and to accrue for estimated incurred but
unidentified issues based on historical activity. To date, there
are no such accruals or related expenses.   
Advertising Expenses All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
To date, advertising costs have not been material.   
Net Loss Per Share Basic and diluted net loss per share is presented
in conformity with the FASBs SFAS128, Earnings
Per Share, for all periods presented. Basic and diluted
net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period,
less weighted-average shares subject to repurchase. The following table presents the computation of

The Company has excluded all outstanding stock
options and shares subject to repurchase from the calculation of
basic and diluted net loss per share because these securities
are antidilutive for all periods presented. Options and warrants
to purchase 33,706,226, 32,917,730 and 22,885,437shares of
common stock in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, determined
using the treasury stock method, were not included in the
computation of diluted net loss per share because the effect
would be antidilutive. These securities, had they been dilutive,
would have been included in the computation of diluted net loss
per share using the treasury stock method. In relation to the Companys December 2003
common stock offering, on January12, 2004, the
Companys underwriters exercised their over-allotment
option and purchased 375million shares.   
Stock-Based Compensation In December 2002, the FASB issued, and the
Company adopted, SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an Amendment of FASB Statement No123. SFAS148
amends the disclosure requirements of FASBs SFAS123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to require
more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. 52 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Transmeta has employee stock plans that are
described more fully in Note 11. The Company accounts for its
stock options and equity awards in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations and has elected to follow the
disclosure only alternative prescribed by SFAS 123.
Expense associated with stock-based compensation is amortized on
an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual
award consistent with the method described in FASB
Interpretation28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation
Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plan.
Accordingly, approximately 59% of the unearned deferred
compensation is amortized in the first year, 25% in the second
year, 12% in the third year, and 4% in the fourth year following
the date of grant. Pursuant to SFAS123, Transmeta
discloses the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of
accounting for its stock-based compensation arrangements. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of options is amortized to pro forma
expense over the options vesting period using an
accelerated graded method. Pro forma information follows

See Note11 for a discussion of the
assumptions used in the option pricing model and estimated fair
value of employee stock options. Options and warrants granted to consultants and
vendors are accounted for at fair value determined by using the
Black-Scholes method in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force EITFIssue No96-18. The assumptions used to
value stock-based awards to consultants and vendors are similar
to those used for employees except that the respective
contractual life of the warrant or option was used instead of
the estimated life. See Note 11. Due to the resignation in fiscal 2001 of certain
officers and the treatment of the notes they issued to the
Company in order to early exercise their options, the Company is
accounting for all remaining stockholder notes that were issued
to purchase shares of the Companys common stock as if such
notes had terms equivalent to non-recourse notes. As a result,
in fiscal 2001 the Company recorded additional stock
compensation expense to write-off all accrued interest related
to its remaining stockholder notes and recorded an adjustment to
its balance sheet to reduce common stock and reduce notes
receivable from stockholders by the remaining amounts owed under
the stockholder notes. This entry did not have a material impact
on stockholders equity. In addition, under the terms of the outstanding
stockholder notes, interest continues to accrue until the notes
are paid. In assessing these notes as non-recourse, the
underlying purchase price for the shares is not deemed to be
fixed until the notes have been paid or otherwise settled.
Accordingly, the Company determined that variable accounting is
to be applied to these note arrangements as long as the notes
remain outstanding. Under variable accounting, the Company
records compensation expense for the vested shares for the
excess, if any, of the current market value of the shares over
the then current principle amount of the notes and accrued
interest, determined separately for each outstanding stockholder
note. This variable accounting resulted in the Company recording
a stock compensation expense of $27million in fiscal 2003
resulting from a higher share 53 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued price of the Companys common stock at the
end of fiscal 2003 compared to the end of fiscal 2002. Stock
compensation expense related to variable accounting was a
benefit of $18million in fiscal 2002 and expenses of
$25million in fiscal 2001. The market value of the
Companys common stock was $324, $121 and $222 per share
at the end of fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. During
the remaining life of these outstanding stockholder notes, the
Companys reported stock compensation will be adjusted
upward expenseor downward benefitat each period
end, based on the above stated formula.   
Restructuring Charges The Company accounted for its restructuring
activity during fiscal 2002 under EITF Issue No94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Cots Incurred in a Restructuring for recognition of
liabilities and expenses associated with exit and disposal costs
when the Company made a commitment to a firm exit plan. In July
2002, the FASB issued SFAS 146 Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF
Issue No94-3. SFAS146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities that are initiated after December31,
2002. Any future restructuring activities, if any, will be
recorded in accordance with SFAS 146, which requires that a
liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity
be recognized when the liability is incurred.   
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
year balances in order to conform to the current year
presentation.   
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN No46
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46
requires a variable interest to be consolidated by a company if
that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from
the variable interest entitys activities, entitled to
receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or
both. A variable interest entity VIEis a corporation,
partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for
business purposes that either adoes not have equity
investors with voting rights or bhas equity investors
that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the
entity to support its activities. A variable interest entity
often holds financial assets, including loans or receivables,
real estate or other property. A variable interest entity may be
essentially passive or it may engage in research and development
or other activities on behalf of another company. In December
2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications
to FIN 46 Revised Interpretations resulting in
multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the
creation date of the VIE. FIN46 became effective for
financial statements issued for the first reporting period
ending after December15, 2003. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position or results of operations. 54 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable based upon the expected collectibility of
accounts receivable. During fiscal 2002 the Company increased
the allowance for doubtful accounts from $0 at December31,
2001 to $90,000 at December31, 2002, which resulted in a
charge to bad debt expense of $90,000. During fiscal 2003, the
Company increased the allowance for doubtful accounts from
$90,000 at December31, 2002 to $215,000 at
December31, 2003, which resulted in a charge to bad debt
expense of $125,000. There were no other adjustments to the
allowance for bad doubtful accounts during fiscal 2003 and 2002.
Net accounts receivable at December31, 2003 and 2002
included a revenue reserve of $23,000 and $65,000, respectively.

The Company made adjustments of $15million
and $26million for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, to
decrease the value of its inventory in response to lower demand
and lower average selling prices expected in future periods for
some of its products. Of the $88million and
$109million of inventory on hand at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, $26million and
$28million of inventory, respectively, was stated at net
realizable value. Accordingly, gross margin may benefit from
future sales of these parts to the extent that the associated
revenue exceeds their currently adjusted values. For fiscal
2003, the Companys gross margins included a benefit of
$05million resulting from the sale of previously reserved
inventory. For fiscal 2002, the Company recognized
$07million in gross margin related to the sale of
inventory for which the value had been written down in previous
periods. Additionally, the Company recognized 100% gross profit
of $12million in fiscal 2002, respectively, related to
the reversal of previously accrued inventory related to purchase
commitments due to favorable settlements of such purchase
commitments. 56 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Technology License Agreements In December 1997, Transmeta entered into a
technology license agreement with IBM Corporation IBM, which
was amended in 1999 and again in 2000. The term of the original
agreement was five years. In the first amendment, in November
1999, IBM relinquished certain of the worldwide license rights
previously obtained in exchange for commitments by Transmeta.
These commitments included payments of $330million to IBM
in various installments beginning in fiscal 2001 through fiscal
2004. 57 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The then net present value of the
$330million commitment approximately $189million
was recorded on the balance sheet as an element of deferred
charges under license agreements with a corresponding liability.
The liability is being accreted to its future value using the
effective interest method at a rate of approximately 15% per
annum and the accretion expense is being recorded as part of
amortization of deferred charges, patents and patent rights.
Accretion expense for these payments for fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001 was $27million, $32million, and
$30million, respectively. During 2001, Transmeta
fulfilled its obligation to pay IBM the $40million
payment due on or before December15, 2001 by negotiating a
$35million payment in June 2001. A scheduled payment of
$70million and $60million was made to IBM in
December 2003 and 2002, respectively, in accordance with the
terms of the agreement. The future cash commitment to IBM at

The convertibility of IBMs convertible
promissory note, issued with the original agreement entered into
in December 1997, was fixed at 1,200,000shares of
Transmetas common stock as part of the amended agreement.
The fair value of the embedded beneficial conversion feature of
the amended convertible promissory note was estimated to be
$32million based on the Black-Scholes method using a
dividend yield of 0%, a risk-free interest rate of 635%, an
expected life of four years and a volatility factor of 08. The
fair value was recorded as a deferred charge under license
agreements and was credited to common stock. On September28, 2000, Transmeta and IBM
agreed to a further amendment to the technology license
agreement. IBM relinquished the right to receive certain
contingent payments in exchange for a fixed commitment to pay
$50million, which was paid in two installments during the
fourth quarter of 2000. This charge was recorded as a deferred
charge under license agreements. In February 1998, Transmeta also entered into a
similar technology license agreement with Toshiba Corporation
Toshiba. In February 2000, Transmeta and Toshiba amended their
technology license agreement and Toshiba relinquished certain of
their worldwide license rights previously obtained from
Transmeta in exchange for 1,200,000shares of Transmeta
common stock. The then current value of the common stock 68million, was recorded on the balance sheet as a
deferred charge under license agreements. Through the fourth quarter of 2001, the deferred
charges under the IBM and Toshiba license agreements had been
amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of
the original license agreements. During the fourth quarter of
2001, as part of the Companys routine procedures and due
to the emergence of indicators of impairment, Transmeta
performed an assessment of the carrying value its long-lived
assets to be held and used. The assessment was performed in
connection with the Companys internal policies and
pursuant to SFAS 121 because of the significant negative
industry and economic trends and particularly because of the
Companys delayed shipments due to difficulties in bringing
new products into high volume distribution, which significantly
affected the Companys operations and expected future
operating cash flows. The conclusion of that assessment was that
future cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of all
long-lived assets. As a result, during the fourth quarter of
2001, the Company recorded a charge of $166 million to
write-off such deferred charges under license agreements based
on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets
exceeded their fair value. Fair value was determined to be zero,
and was based on future cash flows for the company as a whole.
The assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows
reflect managements best estimates. Although the asset was
impaired, the associated liability is in effect and will
continue to accrete interest until the final payment is made,
which is due in 2004. 58 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Patents and Patent Rights Patents and patent rights for microprocessor
technology were acquired from Seiko Epson Epson in May 2001.
Under the patent and patent rights agreement with Epson,
Transmeta agreed to pay Epson a combination of
$300million cash and shares of the Companys common
stock valued at $100million based upon the average of the
closing stock price over a defined period. The Company recorded
total consideration of $381million consisting of
$108million of Transmeta common stock, $268million
as the net present value of cash payments and $05million
of acquisition costs on the balance sheet as an element of
patents and patent rights. The Company paid Epson
$75million in cash and 766,930 shares of the
Companys unregistered common stock in May 2001. The number
of shares issued to Epson was calculated in accordance with the
agreement; however for accounting purposes the value of the
shares was determined using the closing price on the issuance
date, or $1410, resulting in a recorded value of
$108million. The Company paid Epson $75million in
cash in May 2003 and $75million in cash in May 2002 in
accordance with the terms of the agreement. Additional patent and patents rights for
microprocessor technology were acquired from another third party
in February 2001. In exchange for the acquired patent and patent
rights, Transmeta agreed to pay a combination of
$70million cash and shares of the Companys common
stock valued at $30million over a three year period. The
Company recorded total consideration of $97million
consisting of the net present value of cash payments of
$67million and $30million of Transmeta common
stock. The Company paid $15million, $15million and
$40million in cash in February 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company issued 796,178shares, 340,483
shares and 31,719shares of the Companys unregistered
common stock in February 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Each
issuance had a market value of $10million calculated in
accordance with the terms of the agreement. The present value of future cash payments due
Epson and others in 2004 accretes interest using the effective
interest method at a rate of 10% per annum. Total commitments

Purchased In-process Research and
Development In April 2001, Transmeta licensed certain
computing technologies and intellectual property from Advanced
Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, including AMDs HyperTransport
interconnect technology for its future products and technology
initiatives. As consideration for the technology rights licensed
under the agreement, the Company issued 1,000,000 unregistered
shares of its common stock valued at $150million based
upon the average closing price of the Companys stock prior
to issuance; however, for accounting purposes the value of the
shares was determined using the closing price of the stock at
the date of issuance, or $1360, resulting in a recorded value
of $136million. The entire $136million was
expensed as purchased in-process research and development during
the second quarter of 2001 because the HyperTransport technology
is designed for use in products that were under development at
the time of acquisition.

Restructuring Charges In the second quarter of fiscal 2002, Transmeta
recorded a $106million restructuring charge as a result
of the Companys decision to cease development and
productization of the TM6000 microprocessor. The restructuring
charge consisted primarily of lease costs, equipment write-offs
and other costs as the Company identified a number of leased
facilities as well as leased and owned equipment that were no
longer required. 59 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued On July18, 2002 and in connection with
Transmetas decision to cease the development and
productization of the TM6000 microprocessor, the Company
terminated approximately 195employees and contractors. As
a result, the Company recorded severance and termination charges
of $41million in the third quarter of fiscal 2002, which
excludes a credit of $17million to deferred compensation
expense related to stock option cancellations for terminated
employees. Additionally, the Company paid approximately $531,000
for previously accrued compensation in the third quarter of
fiscal 2002 in connection with the employee terminations. Of the
approximately 195 employees and contractors that were terminated
on July18, 2002, approximately 44 were sales, marketing,
and administrative employees and approximately 151 were research
and development personnel. The Companys workforce
reduction was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
Additionally, the Company vacated all excess facilities as of
September30, 2002. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003,
Transmeta reassessed the adequacy of the remaining accrual and
adjusted the restructuring reserve balance as a result of an
update in certain underlying assumptions. The Company
anticipates using portions of previously vacated space primarily
to expand research and development activities. Also, the Company
was able to sublease other previously vacated space earlier than
originally anticipated at a lower rate than originally
estimated. As a result of this update in assumptions, the
Company adjusted the balance in accrued restructuring costs and
recorded a credit of $244,000 in restructuring charges. Net
non-cash drawdowns in fiscal 2003 primarily consist of interest
accretion related to building commitments, write-offs of certain
property and equipment and reclassification of drawdowns between
anticipated workforce reduction and anticipated building
leasehold cost. Accrued restructuring charges consist of the

Commitments and Contingencies Transmeta leases its facilities and certain
equipment under noncancelable operating leases expiring through
2008. Gross operating lease and rental expenses were
$22million in 2003, $37million in 2002 and
$43million in 2001. The facility leases provide for a 4%
annual base rent increase. During fiscal 2002 and 2001,
Transmeta subleased a portion of its facilities. Sublease income
was $122,000 in 2002 and $547,000 in 2001. Of the total
operating lease commitments of $199million included in
the table below, the Company has accrued $61million of
the liabilities as a component of accrued restructuring costs
See Note7. During fiscal 2003, Transmeta entered into an
agreement that expires in 2007 to sublease a portion of its
facilities that was vacated as part of the 2002 restructuring
plan. Accordingly, sublease income of $128,000 in fiscal 2003
derived from this agreement was charged to the accrued
restructuring charge balance. The Company finances certain equipment and
software under noncancelable lease agreements that are accounted
for as capital leases. 60 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Transmetas foundry relationship with TSMC
allows the Company to cancel all outstanding purchase orders,
but requires Transmeta to pay the foundry for expenses it has
incurred in connection with the purchase orders through the date
of cancellation. As of December31, 2003, TSMC had incurred
approximately $19million of manufacturing expenses on the
Companys outstanding purchase orders. Transmeta outsources certain production and
non-production related services to a third-party supplier. Under
the terms of an agreement with the supplier, Transmeta has a
non-cancelable $14million purchase commitment for certain
services, of which $05million have been purchased and an
additional $06million have been pre-paid as of
December31, 2003. Under the terms of the agreement,
Transmeta must fulfill its purchase obligation before July 2004,
or risk losing the prepaid funds if the Company is unable to
extend the purchase commitment deadline. As of December31,
2003, management feels that the Company will be able to satisfy
its purchase commitment before the agreements expiration
date.

Debt Transmeta issued promissory notes to financing
companies in the principal amounts of $14million in 1999,
which mature through January 2003. As of December31, 2003,
these notes have been fully paid. No additional notes were
issued after 1999. In connection with the notes, Transmeta
issued to the note holders warrants to purchase
735,032shares of common stock. Warrants to purchase
685,032shares of common stock were issued with an exercise
price of $125 and expire between March 2004 and April 2008.
Warrants to purchase 50,000shares of common stock were
issued with an exercise price of $300 and expire in May 2005.
These warrants were assigned an aggregate value of $78,000 on
the basis of Black-Scholes valuation models using the
contractual lives ranging from six to ten years and a volatility
of 080. The value of the warrants was recorded as a discount
against the respective borrowings. The amount of discount
accreted and recorded as interest expense for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $0, $0 and $7,000,
respectively. In October 2003, one of the note holders, who was
issued a warrant to purchase 320,000shares of common
stock, exercised the warrant and paid the $125 per share
exercise price by a net exercise of the warrant through the
surrender of shares issuable under the warrant. The note holder
was issued 222,960 shares of common stock from this net
exercise. See Note11 for warrants outstanding to purchase
common stock at December31, 2003. 61 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stockholders Equity In December 2003, the Company completed a public

All warrants have been valued using the
Black-Scholes valuation model based on the assumptions used for
stock-based awards to employees see Note11 except that a
volatility of 080 was used was used through fiscal 2000.
Assigned values of $30,000 and $17,000 associated with these
warrant issuances were recorded as common stock in 2000 and
1999, respectively, and were amortized as interest expense over
the term of the agreement or the period the services were
rendered. Costs associated with warrants issued during 2001 were
immaterial.   
Treasury Stock In connection with the resignation of two
officers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company
purchased 796,875 mature vested shares with a market value of
approximately $24million held by the two officers in
exchange for cancellations of a portion of shareholder notes
held by the officers see Note11. Mature vested shares
are shares that have been both vested and outstanding for over
six months. As a result of this transaction, the Company has
recorded $24million as a contra-equity balance
representing the market value of the treasury stock at the date
the shares were acquired and the notes were cancelled. 62 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued   
Preferred Stock The Company is authorized, subject to limitations
imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to a total of
5,000,000shares of preferred stock in one or more series,
without stockholder approval. The Board of Directors is
authorized to establish from time to time the number of shares
to be included in each series, and to fix the rights,
preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued
series and any of its qualifications, limitations or
restrictions. The Board of Directors can also increase or
decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the
number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any
further vote or action by the stockholders. The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance
of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could
harm the voting power or other rights of the holders of the
common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing
flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other
corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of
Transmeta and might harm the market price of its common stock
and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock.
As of December31, 2003 and 2002, there were no shares of
preferred stock outstanding.   
Stockholders Rights
Agreement On January10, 2002, the Company entered
into a Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Companys
Board of Directors declared a dividend of one stock purchase
right a Right for each outstanding share of the
Companys common stock. The dividend was issued to
stockholders of record on January18, 2002. In addition,
one Right shall be issued with each share of the Companys
common stock that becomes outstanding ibetween the
record date and the earliest of the Distribution Date, the
Redemption Date and the Final Expiration Date as such terms are
defined in the Rights Agreement or iifollowing the
Distribution Date and prior to the Redemption Date or Final
Expiration Date, pursuant to the exercise of stock options or
under any employee plan or arrangement or upon the exercise,
conversion or exchange of other securities of the Company, which
options or securities were outstanding prior to the Distribution
Date. The Rights will become exercisable only upon the
occurrence of certain events specified in the Rights Agreement,
including the acquisition of 15% of the Companys
outstanding common stock by a person or group. Each Right
entitles the registered holder, other than an acquiring
person, under specified circumstances, to purchase from
the Company one one-hundredth of a share of SeriesA Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, par value $000001 per share, of
the Company, at a price of $2100 per one one-hundredth of a
share of that preferred stock, subject to adjustment. In
addition, each Right entitles the registered holder, other than
an acquiring person, under specified circumstances,
to purchase from the Company that number of shares of the
Companys Common Stock having a market value of two times
the exercise price of the Right.

Stock-Based Compensation   
2000 Equity Incentive Plan The 2000 Equity Incentive Plan the
Plan was adopted in September 2000 and became effective
November6, 2000. The Plan serves as the successor to the
1997 Equity Incentive Plan, and authorizes the award of options,
restricted stock and stock bonuses and provides for the grant of
both incentive stock options ISOs that
qualify under Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code to
employees and nonqualified stock options to employees, directors
and consultants. The exercise price of the incentive stock
options must be at least equal to the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of
incentive stock options granted to 10% stockholders must be at
least equal to 110% of the fair market value of the common stock
on the date of grant. The maximum term of the options granted is
ten years. During any calendar year, no person will be eligible
to receive more than 4,000,000shares, or
6,000,000shares in the case of a new employee. Transmeta initially reserved
7,000,000shares of common stock under the Plan. The
aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan
is increased automatically on January1 of each year
starting on 63 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued January1, 2001 by an amount equal to 5% of
the total outstanding shares of the Company on the immediately
preceding December31. As a result of this provision,
6,804,307, 6,611,728 and 6,520,946 shares were added to the Plan
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, the Plan
allows for canceled shares from the 1995 and 1997 Equity
Incentive Plans to be transferred into the 2000 Plan. As a
result of this provision, 728,479, 3,116,323 and 1,508,882
shares were also added to the Plan in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.   
Non-Plan Stock Option Grants Transmeta has from time to time granted options
outside of its plans non-plan stock options.
Non-plan stock options to purchase shares of common stock
authorized and granted were 7,046,000 in 2000 and 2,500,000 in
1999. No non-plan stock options were granted in 2003, 2002 and
2001.   
Prior Equity Incentive Plans The 1995 Equity Incentive Plan and the 1997
Equity Incentive Plan the Prior Plans provided for
the grant of ISOs to employees and the grant of nonstatutory
stock options to employees, directors and consultants. Options
granted under the Prior Plans were designated as
ISO, or nonstatutory stock options at
the discretion of Transmeta, with exercise prices not less than
the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted
under the Prior Plans generally vest 25% on the first
anniversary of the vesting start date and then monthly over the
next three years and expire ten years from the grant date.

2000 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan Transmeta effected the 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan in November 2000.
The Purchase Plan allows employees to designate up to 15% of
their total compensation to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock at 85% of fair market value. Upon
effectiveness of the Purchase Plan, the Company reserved
2,000,000shares of common stock under the Purchase Plan.
In addition, the aggregate number of shares reserved for
issuance under the Purchase Plan will be increased automatically
on January1 of each year starting on January1, 2001
by an amount equal to 1% of the total outstanding shares of the
Company on the immediately preceding December31. As a
result of this provision, 1,360,861, 1,322,346 and
1,304,189shares were added to the Purchase Plan in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. In May 2002, the Companys
stockholders authorized an additional 4,000,000shares to
be available under the Purchase Plan. As of December31,
2003, 5,919,975shares had been issued under the Purchase
Plan.   
Deferred Stock Compensation Transmeta recorded deferred stock compensation of
$460million during 2000, representing the aggregate
difference between the exercise prices of certain options and
the deemed fair values of common stock subject to the options as
of the respective measurement dates. This amount is being
amortized by charges to operations, using the accelerated graded
method, over the four year vesting periods of the individual
stock options. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded
$18million, $36million and $168million,
respectively, of net amortization expense related to deferred
stock compensation. The net amortization expense recorded during
fiscal 2002 included a credit of $17million for stock
option cancellations resulting from the Companys workforce
reduction in the third quarter.   
Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation The Company has elected to follow
APBOpinion25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its employee and director stock-based awards
because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value
accounting 65 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued provided for under SFAS123 requires use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock-based awards. Under
APBOpinion25, the Company recognizes no compensation
expense with respect to awards if the exercise price equals or
exceeds the fair value of the underlying security on the date of
grant and other terms are fixed. Notes Receivable from Stockholders.
Transmetas equity incentive
plans permit, subject to approval by the Board of Directors,
holders of options granted prior to March 1999 and certain
holders of non-plan grants to exercise stock options before they
are vested. Shares of common stock issued in connection with
these exercises are subject to repurchase at the exercise price.
At December31, 2003, the outstanding notes issued by
employees to exercise stock options bear interest at rates
ranging from 477% to 660% and have original terms of five
years. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, all notes
were full recourse and were recorded as a reduction of
stockholders equity when issued. Officer notes. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the employment of two
officers terminated. In connection with the termination of their
employment, the Company repurchased a total of 796,875 vested
shares and 1,753,125 unvested shares held by these officers.
These shares were originally issued in return for an aggregate
of $80million in recourse notes. As a result of the
repurchase of these shares and the cancellation of the
outstanding recourse notes and accrued interest, Transmeta
recorded additional stock compensation expense of
$12million primarily to write-off accrued interest on the
notes and an offsetting entry of $19million to reverse
stock compensation expense previously recognized on the unvested
shares. Recourse notes held by other officers and
employees. At the time the above two
officer notes were cancelled, other recourse notes for a total
of $82million, including $07million of accrued
interest, were outstanding. Because the Company did not enforce
the recourse provisions of the notes for the officers that
resigned, which would have recouped all principal and interest,
in the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company began to account for
these remaining notes as if they had terms equivalent to
non-recourse notes, even though the terms of these notes were
not in fact changed from recourse to non-recourse. Transmeta will continue to record stock
compensation expense on these stock awards until the notes are
paid based on the current market value of its stock at the end
of each accounting period. This variable stock compensation will
be based on the excess, if any, of the current market price of
its stock as of period-end over the purchase price of the stock
award, adjusted for vesting and prior stock compensation expense
recognized on the stock award. At December31, 2003, the
Company had 1,108,000 shares that are subject to variable stock
compensation at prices ranging from $019 to $065 per share.
During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded $27million of
variable stock compensation expense relating to these stock
awards. During fiscal 2002, stock compensation included a credit
of $18million recorded to stock compensation expense due
to a lower market price of our common stock at the end of fiscal
2002 compared to the end of fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001,
Transmeta recorded $25million of variable stock
compensation expense relating to these stock awards. In
addition, the Company recorded additional stock compensation
expense of $07million to write-off all interest that had
accrued under the other recourse notes. In the future, if the
price of the Companys stock increases $1per share it
will result in approximately $11million of additional
stock compensation expense, or if the stock decreases $1 per
share it will result in a benefit reductionin stock
compensation expense of approximately the same amount. Because
variable stock compensation expense is calculated based on the
current market value of the Companys common stock at the
end of each accounting period, future stock compensation expense
for these variable stock awards could increase significantly in
periods when the Companys stock price rises, and could
reverse and become a benefit in periods when the Companys
stock price falls. The Company also has an additional
1,100,000shares that are subject to variable accounting if
its stock price increases above approximately $1150 per share.
However, the Company has a call option on these shares that it
intends to exercise before the stock price exceeds $1150 per
share and does not believe it will incur variable stock
compensation on these shares. 66 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Fair value accounting for stock-based awards.
The fair value for the Companys
stock-based awards is estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. Because
the Companys stock-based awards have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards. The fair
value of options granted in 2000 was determined based on
estimated stock price volatility. The weighted average
assumptions used to determine fair value were as follows

Employee Benefit Plan Transmeta has an Employee Savings and Retirement
Plan the Benefit Plan under Section401k of
the Internal Revenue Code for its eligible employees. The
Benefit Plan is available to all of Transmetas employees
who meet minimum age requirements, and provides employees with
tax deferred salary deductions and alternative investment
options. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible
earnings, subject to certain limitations. There have been no
matching contributions by the Company under the Benefit Plan.

Related Party Transaction Transmeta entered into a trademark and technology
licensing agreement during fiscal 2003 with Chinese2 Linux
Holdings Limited. In relation to this agreement, the Company

agreement was entered. The agreement resulted in recognition of
license revenue of $140,000 during fiscal 2003.

Income Taxes Transmeta recorded a provision for foreign income
taxes of $32,000 and $21,000 for fiscal 2003 and 2002,

Based upon the weight of available evidence,
which includes the Companys historical operating
performance, the Company has always provided a full valuation
allowance against its net deferred tax assets as it is more
likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The valuation allowance increased by
$290million in 2003, $408million in 2002 and
$535million in 2001. The federal operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards listed above will expire between 2010 and 2023, if
not previously utilized. The state operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards will expire beginning in 2005, if not previously
utilized. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss
may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the

Legal Proceedings Beginning in June 2001, Transmeta, its directors,
and certain of its officers were named as defendants in several
putative shareholder class actions that were consolidated in and
by the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California as In re Transmeta Corporation Securities
Litigation, Case No.C01-02450WHA. The
complaints purported to allege a class action on behalf of
persons who purchased Transmeta common stock between
November7, 2000 and July19, 2001, and alleged
violations of Sections10b and 20a of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule10b-5
promulgated thereunder, and Sections11 and 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In March 2002, the Court
granted in part and denied in part defendants motions to
dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. In May 2002, the
Court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion
to dismiss the second amended complaint, and denied
plaintiffs motion for leave to file a third amended
complaint. In June 2002, defendants answered the second amended
complaint as to the sole surviving claim. In July 2002,
defendants filed a motion for summary judgment relating to that
claim. In July 2002, plaintiffs moved for class certification
and initiated discussion of a proposed settlement. The Company
and the individual defendants believe that the complaints are
without merit and deny any liability, but because they also wish
to avoid the continuing waste of management time and expense of
litigation, they entered into an agreement in October 2002 to
settle all claims that might have been brought in this action
for approximately $55million, all of which monies have
been fully funded by defendants director and officer
liability insurance. In March 2003, after proper class notice
and hearings, the Court approved the settlement and entered
judgment for defendants, dismissing the action. In April 2003, a
plaintiffs law firm that was not selected by the Court to
serve as class counsel filed a notice of appeal relating to
certain Court orders addressing that firms applications to
the Court for attorneys fees. In August 2003, on
appellants own motion, the Court of Appeals dismissed the
appeal. Beginning in June 2001, the directors and certain
officers of Transmeta were named as defendants in four purported
shareholder derivative actions that were consolidated in and by
the Superior Court for Santa Clara County in In re Transmeta
Corporation Derivative Litigation, Master File No.CV
799491. The complaints were based upon the same matters alleged
in the shareholder class action described above. In July 2002,
the Court sustained the Companys demurrer with leave to
amend based on plaintiffs lack of standing, and deferred
consideration of the individual defendants demurrer on the
merits. The Company and the individual defendants believe that
the complaints are without merit and deny any liability, but
because they also wish to avoid the continuing waste of
management time and expense of litigation, they entered into an
agreement to settle all claims that might have been brought in
this action. The settlement includes a payment of 69 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued approximately $300,000 in fees to counsel for the
derivative plaintiffs and shall be fully funded by
defendants director and officer liability insurance. In
October 2003, upon motion and after a hearing, the Court
approved the settlement and entered an order dismissing the
consolidated derivative action as to all defendants. Beginning in June 2001, the Company, certain of
its directors and officers, and certain of the underwriters for
its initial public offering were named as defendants in three
putative shareholder class actions that were consolidated in and
by the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York in In re Transmeta Corporation Initial Public
Offering Securities Litigation, Case No01 CV 6492.
The complaints allege that the prospectus issued in connection
with the Companys initial public offering on
November7, 2000 failed to disclose certain alleged actions
by the underwriters for that offering, and alleges claims
against the Company and several of its officers and directors
under Sections11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and under Sections10b and Section20a of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Similar actions
have been filed against more than 300 other companies that
issued stock in connection with other initial public offerings
during 1999-2000. Those cases have been coordinated for pretrial
purposes as In re Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation, Master File No21MC92 SAS.
In July 2002, the Company joined in a coordinated motion to
dismiss filed on behalf of multiple issuers and other
defendants. In February 2003, the Court granted in part and
denied in part the coordinated motion to dismiss, and issued an
order regarding the pleading of amended complaints. Plaintiffs
subsequently proposed a settlement offer to all issuer
defendants, which settlement would provide for payments by
issuers insurance carriers if plaintiffs fail to recover a
certain amount from underwriter defendants. Although the Company
and the individual defendants believe that the complaints are
without merit and deny any liability, but because they also wish
to avoid the continuing waste of management time and expense of
litigation, they accepted plaintiffs proposal to settle
all claims that might have been brought in this action. The
Company and the individual Transmeta defendants expect that
their share of the global settlement will be fully funded by
their director and officer liability insurance. Although the
Company and the Transmeta defendants have approved the
settlement in principle, it remains subject to several
procedural conditions, as well as formal approval by the Court.
It is possible that the parties may not reach a final written
settlement agreement or that the Court may decline to approve
the settlement in whole or part. In the event that the parties
do not reach agreement on the final settlement, the Company and
the Transmeta defendants believe that they have meritorious
defenses and intend to defend any remaining action vigorously.

Subsequent Event In relation to the Companys
December2003 common stock offering, on January12,
2004, the Companys underwriters exercised their
over-allotment option and purchased 375million shares,
resulting in net proceeds to the company, before expenses, of
$102million. The shares were offered under the shelf S-3
registration statement that was filed by Transmeta with the
Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC and
declared effective on July29, 2003 by the SEC. 70 Table of Contents TRANSMETA CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures. The Securities and
Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls
and procedures to mean a companys controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required

the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in

officer and chief financial officer have concluded, based on the
evaluation of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures by our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as of the
end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective for this purpose. Changes in Internal
Controls. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2003, there were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that have materially affected or are
reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting. PART III
