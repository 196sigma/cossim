Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of November30, 2013and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November30, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries as of November30, 2013and 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November30, 2013, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of November30, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January27, 2014expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting./s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLPCertified Public AccountantsMiami, FloridaJanuary27, 201479Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSNovember30, 2013and  share amountsASSETSLennar Homebuilding:Cash and cash  cash36,1508,096Receivables,  homes and construction in  and land under  inventory not owned460,159326,861Total  in unconsolidated entities716,949562,234Other  Investments:Cash and cash  cash2,593Defeasance cash to retire notes payable223,813Receivables, net111,833Loans receivable, net278,392436,535Loans held-for-sale44,228Real estate owned -  estate owned - held-and-used, net428,989601,022Investments in unconsolidated entities154,573108,140Other  Financial Services796,710912,995Lennar Multifamily147,08929,122Total  certain provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810, Consolidations, ASC 810 the Company is required to separately disclose on its consolidated balance sheets the assets of consolidated variable interest entities VIEs that are owned by the consolidated VIEs and liabilities of consolidated VIEs as to which there is no recourse against the Company.As of November30, 2013, total assets include $1,1953 millionrelated to consolidated VIEs of which $83 millionis included in Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, $177 millionin restricted cash, $24 millionin Lennar Homebuilding receivables, net, $948 millionin Lennar Homebuilding land and land under development, $2436 millionin Lennar Homebuilding consolidated inventory not owned, $147 millionin Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities, $868 millionin Lennar Homebuilding other assets, $448 millionin Rialto Investments Rialto cash and cash equivalents, $2440 millionin Rialto loans receivable, net, $1220 millionin Rialto real estate owned held-for-sale, $3138 millionin Rialto real estate owned held-and-used, net, $07 millionin Rialto investments in unconsolidated entities and $18 millionin Rialto other assets.As of November30, 2012, total assets include $2,1286 millionrelated to consolidated VIEs of which $132 millionis included in Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, $60 millionin Lennar Homebuilding receivables, net, $574 millionin Lennar Homebuilding finished homes and construction in progress, $4826 millionin Lennar Homebuilding land and land under development, $652 millionin Lennar Homebuilding consolidated inventory not owned, $437 millionin Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities, $2241 millionin Lennar Homebuilding other assets, $1048 millionin Rialto cash and cash equivalents, $2238 millionin Rialto defeasance cash to retire notes payable, $3502 millionin Rialto loans receivable, net, $942 millionin Rialto real estate owned held-for-sale, $4549 millionin Rialto real estate owned held-and-used, net, $07 millionin Rialto investments in unconsolidated entities and $78 millionin Rialto other assets.See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements80Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSNovember30, 2013and  share amountsLIABILITIES AND EQUITYLennar Homebuilding:Accounts  related to consolidated inventory not owned384,876268,159Senior notes and other debts   Investments:Notes payable and other  Financial Services543,639630,972Lennar Multifamily41,5263,294Total  equity:Preferred stockClassA common stock of $010 par value per share;

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which Lennar Corporation has a controlling interest and VIEs see Note 16 in which Lennar Corporation is deemed the primary beneficiary the Company. The Companys investments in both unconsolidated entities in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and in VIEs in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary are accounted for by the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Revenue RecognitionRevenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. See Lennar Financial Services, Rialto and Lennar Multifamily within this Note for disclosure of other revenue recognition policies related to those segments.Advertising CostsThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $319 million, $330 millionand $412 million, respectively, for the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011.Share-Based PaymentsThe Company has share-based awards outstanding under one plan which provides for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock nonvested shares to key officers, associates and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than tenyears after the date of the grant. The Company accounts for stock option awards and nonvested share awards granted under the plans based on the estimated grant date fair value.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values. Cash and cash equivalents as of November30, 2013and 2012included $1723 millionand $1930 million, respectively, of cash held in escrow for approximately three days.Restricted CashRestricted cash consists of customer deposits on home sales held in restricted accounts until title transfers to the homebuyer, as required by the state and local governments in which the homes were sold, as well as funds on deposit to secure and support performance  of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedFinished homes and construction in progress are included within inventories. Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as incurred. Homes held-for-sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. The Company reviews its inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were 535and 457active communities, excluding unconsolidated entities, as of November30, 2013and 2012, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.In conducting its review for indicators of impairment on a community level, the Company evaluates, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales and the estimated fair value of the land itself. The Company pays particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, the Company identifies communities whose carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows.The Company estimates the fair value of its communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above. For example, since the start of the downturn in the housing market, the Company has found ways to reduce its construction costs in many communities, and this reduction in construction costs in addition to change in product type in many communities has impacted future estimated cash flows.Each of the homebuilding markets in which the Company operates is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of the Companys homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. The Companys projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in the Companys cash flow model are projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver homes on a community by community basis.In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in the Companys cash flow model, the Company analyzes its historical absorption pace in the community as well as other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, the Company considers internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing the Companys historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies, the Company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in its most recent quarters as well as forecasted population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product. Generally, if the Company notices a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, the Company considers such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjusts its historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace in the cash flow model for a community.In order to determine the assumed sales prices included in its cash flow models, the Company analyzes the historical sales prices realized on homes it delivered in the community and other comparable communities in the geographical area as well as the sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities. In addition, the Company considers internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices on similar products in non-neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing its historical sales prices and corresponding market studies, the Company also places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as future forecasted sales prices in neighboring communities as well as future forecasted sales prices for similar products in non-neighboring communities. Generally, if the Company notices a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, the Company considers such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjusts its historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected sales prices in the cash flow model for a community87Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedIn order to arrive at the Companys assumed costs to build and deliver homes, the Company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with its vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Costs assumed in the cash flow model for the Companys communities are generally based on the rates the Company is currently obligated to pay under existing contracts with its vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure.Since the estimates and assumptions included in the Companys cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead the Company to incur additional impairment charges in the future.Using all available information, the Company calculates its best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate the Company believes a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. The Company generally uses a discount rate of approximately 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory.The Company estimates the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or assumptions change. For example, further market deterioration or changes in assumptions may lead to the Company incurring additional impairment charges on previously impaired inventory, as well as on inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if further market deterioration occurs.For the year ended November30, 2013, the Company reviewed its communities for potential indicators of impairments and identified 35homebuilding communities with 1,515homesites and a corresponding carrying value of $1305 millionas having potential indicators of impairment. Of those communities identified, the Company recorded valuation adjustments of $45 millionon 99homesites in 3communities with corresponding carrying value of $165 million.The table below summarizes the most significant unobservable inputs used in the Company discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of its communities primarily one community for which the Company recorded valuation adjustments during the year ended November30, 2013:Unobservable inputsRangeAverage selling  rate per quarter homes2-34Discount rate20%The Company also has access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until it has determined whether to exercise its option. A majority of the Companys option contracts require a non-refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land.The Companys option contracts are recorded at cost. In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, the Company evaluates the option primarily based upon its expected cash flows from the property under option. If the Company intends to walk away from an option contract, it records a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract.See Note 2 for details of inventory valuation adjustments and write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs by reportable segment and Homebuilding Other.Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesThe Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the Companys investment in the unconsolidated entity has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investments carrying amount over its estimated fair value.The evaluation of the Companys investment in unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions made by management: 1projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, 2discount rates applied to the future distributions and 3various other factors88Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Companys assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the unconsolidated entities. Such inventory is also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities. The unconsolidated entities generally use a discount rate of approximately 20%in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, the Companys proportionate share is reflected in the Company homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to its investment in unconsolidated entities. In certain instances, the Company may be required to record additional losses relating to its investment in unconsolidated entities, if the Companys investment in the unconsolidated entity, or a portion thereof, is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. These losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net.Additionally, the Company considers various qualitative factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include age of the venture, intent and ability for the Company to recover its investment in the entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investment, defaults under contracts with third parties including bank debt, recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If the Company believes that the decline in the fair value of the investment is temporary, then no impairment is recorded.See Note 2 for details of valuation adjustments related to the Companys unconsolidated entities by reportable segment and Homebuilding Other.The Company tracks its share of cumulative earnings and distributions of its joint ventures JVs. For purposes of classifying distributions received from JVs in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns oncapital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of the Companys share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns ofcapital and included in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows as investing activities.Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesGAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: athe power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and bthe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.The Companys variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of 1equity ownership, 2contracts to purchase assets, 3 management services and development agreements between the Company and a VIE, 4loans provided by the Company to a VIE or other partner and/or 5guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. The Company examines specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between the Company and the other partners and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. The determination whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether the Company is primary beneficiary may require it to exercise significant judgment.Generally, all major decision making in the Companys joint ventures is shared between all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by the Company are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between the Company and other partners. Generally, the Company purchases less than a majority of the JVs assets and the purchase prices under its option contracts are believed to be at market.Generally, Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partners lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, the Company continues to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions.Operating Properties and EquipmentOperating properties and equipment are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is thirty years, for furniture, fixtures and equipment is twoto tenyears and for leasehold improvements is fiveyears or the life of the lease, 89Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  is shorter. Operating properties are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indicators that their carrying amounts are not recoverable.Investment SecuritiesInvestment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax, until realized. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because they are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity.At November30, 2013and 2012, the Lennar Homebuilding segment had available-for-sale securities totaling $400 millionand $196 million, respectively, included in Lennar Homebuilding other assets, which consist primarily of investments in community development district bonds that mature at various dates between 2022 and 2042. Certain of these bonds are in default by the borrower, which may allow the Company to foreclose on the underlying real estate collateral. At November30, 2013and 2012, the Lennar Financial Services segment had investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaling $623 millionand $639 million, respectively. The Lennar Financial Services held-to-maturity securities consist mainly of corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and U.S. treasury securities that mature at various dates within a year. In addition, at November30, 2013and 2012, the Rialto segment had investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaling $161 millionand $150 million, respectively. The Rialto segment held-to-maturity securities consist of commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS. At both November30, 2013and 2012, the Company had noinvestment securities classified as trading.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting units in which the Company has recorded goodwill. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the Companys management on a regular basis. Inherent in the determination of fair value of the Companys reporting units are certain estimates and judgments, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as the Companys strategic plans with regard to its operations. To the extent additional information arises or the Companys strategies change, it is possible that the Companys conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have an effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.The Company reviews goodwill annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist for impairment. The Company evaluated the carrying value of the Lennar Financial Services segments goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Company estimated the fair value of its title operations based on the income approach and concluded that a goodwill impairment was not required for 2013. As of both November30, 2013and 2012, there were nosignificant identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill.At both November30, 2013and 2012, accumulated goodwill impairments totaled $2174 million, which includes $272 millionand $1902 millionof previous Lennar Financial Services and Lennar Homebuilding goodwill impairment, respectively. At both November30, 2013and 2012, goodwill was $340 million, all of which relates to the Lennar Financial Services segment and is included in the assets of that segment.Interest and Real Estate TaxesInterest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are capitalized as inventories while they are being actively developed. Interest related to homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold. Interest expense related to the Lennar Financial Services operations is included in its costs and expenses.During the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011, interest incurred by the Companys homebuilding operations related to homebuilding debt was $2615 million, $2220 millionand $2014 million, respectively; interest capitalized into inventories was $1676 million, $1277 millionand $1108 million, respectively90Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedInterest expense was included in cost of homes sold, cost of land sold and other interest expense as follows:Years Ended November30,In  expense in cost of homes  expense in cost of land sold2,5621,9071,615Other interest  interest  TaxesThe Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in the financial statements as a component of benefit for income taxes.A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by the Company based on the more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Companys experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.During the years ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of its deferred tax assets would be utilized. This conclusion in 2012 was based on a detailed evaluation of all relevant evidence, both positive and negative. The positive evidence included factors such as eleven consecutive quarters of earnings, the expectation of continued earnings and evidence of a sustained recovery in the housing markets that the Company operates. Such evidence was supported by the Company experiencing significant increases in key financial indicators, including new orders, revenues, gross margin, backlog, gross margin in backlog and deliveries compared with the prior year. The Company has restructured its corporate and field operations, significantly reducing its cost structure and permitting the Company to generate profits at a lower level of activity. Economic data had also been affirming the housing market recovery. Housing starts, homebuilding volume and prices are increasing and forecasted to continue to increase. Low mortgage rates, affordable home prices, reduced foreclosures, and a favorable home ownership to rental comparison continue to drive the recovery. Lastly, the Company projects to use the majority of its net operating losses in the allowable carryforward periods, and have no history of net operating losses expiring unutilized.The Company is required to use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence when determining the need for a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset. The weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence shall be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary. The most significant direct negative evidence in 2012 was that the Company was is in a cumulative four-year loss position. However, in 2013, additional positive evidence included actual and forecasted profitability, as well as, the Company generating cumulative pre-tax earnings over a rolling four year period including the pre-tax earnings achieved during 2013.Based on the analysis of positive and negative evidence, the Company believes that there is enough positive evidence for the Company to conclude that it was more likely than not that the Company would realize its deferred tax assets, and reversed the majority of the valuation allowance established against its deferred tax assets during the years ended November30, 2012 and 2013. See Note 10 for additional information details.Product WarrantyWarranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. The Company regularly monitors the warranty reserve and makes adjustments to its pre-existing warranties in order to reflect 91Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedchanges in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Warranty reserves are included in Lennar Homebuilding other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The activity in the Companys warranty reserve was as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Warranty reserve, beginning of period$84,18888,120Warranties issued during the period50,69535,912Adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates  reserve, end of period$102,58084,1881 The adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates during the year ended November 30, 2013 primarily related to specific claims received in certain of our homebuilding  insurable risks such as construction defects, general liability, medical and workers compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Companys self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. The Companys self-insurance reserve as of November30, 2013and 2012was $1087 millionand $1165 million, respectively, of which $745 millionand $761 million, respectively, was included in Lennar Financial Services other liabilities in the respective years. Amounts incurred in excess of the Company self-insurance occurrence or aggregate retention limits are covered by insurance up to the Company purchased coverage levels. The Company insurance policies are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom the Company believes counterparty default risks is not significant.Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings of the Company.All outstanding nonvested shares that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents that participate in undistributed earnings with common stock are considered participating securities and are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Companys restricted common stock nonvested shares are considered participating securities.Lennar Financial ServicesTitle premiums on policies issued directly by the Company are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by the Company. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates.Loans held-for-sale by the Lennar Financial Services segment are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans and are not amortized. Management believes carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.In addition, the Lennar Financial Services segment recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these servicing rights is included in the Companys loans held-for-sale and Financial Services other assets as of November30, 2013and 2012. Fair 92Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedvalue of the servicing rights is determined based on values in the Companys servicing sales contracts. At November30, 2013and 2012, loans held-for-sale, all of which were accounted for at fair value, had an aggregate fair value of $4142 millionand $5023 million, respectively, and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $3990 millionand $4791 million, respectively, at November30, 2013and 2012.Substantially all of the loans the Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreement. During recent years there has been an increased industry-wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses in an unfavorable economic environment by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. The Companys mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. The Company establishes reserves for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed the Companys expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. Loan origination liabilities are included in Lennar Financial Services liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The activity in the Companys loan origination liabilities was as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Loan origination liabilities, beginning of year$7,2506,050Provision for losses during the year1,8281,062Adjustments to pre-existing provisions for losses from changes in  origination liabilities, end of year$9,3117,250Adjustments to pre-existing provision for losses from changes in estimates for the years ended November30, 2013and 2012include an adjustment for additional repurchase requests that were received beyond the estimated provision that was recorded due to an increase in potential issues identified by certain investors.For Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-investment, net, a loan is deemed impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Interest income is not accrued or recognized on impaired loans unless payment is received. Impaired loans are written-off if and when the loan is no longer secured by collateral. The total unpaid principal balance of the impaired loans was as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Impaired loans unpaid principal balance$7,8977,327Valuation  in impaired loans$4,0062,907The average recorded investment in impaired loans totaled approximately $35 millionand $33 million, respectively, for the years ended November30, 2013and 2012.Loans for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity consist of mortgage loans carried at lower of cost, net of unamortized discounts or fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method.The Lennar Financial Services segment also provides an allowance for loan losses. The provision recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by the Companys managements continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past loan loss experience, credit worthiness and nature of underlying collateral, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Companys management. Anticipated changes in economic factors, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by the Companys management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. While the Companys management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, 93Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedfuture adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond managements control.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Lennar Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates. The segment uses mortgage-backed securities MBS forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to protect the value of fixed rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale from fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value included in Lennar Financial Services revenues.Rialto InvestmentsManagement Fees RevenueThe Rialto segment provides services to a variety of legal entities and investment vehicles such as funds, joint ventures, co-invests, and other private equity structures to manage their respective investments. As a result, Rialto earns and receives management fees, underwriting fees and due diligence fees. These fees related to the Rialto segment are included in Rialto revenues and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rialto receives investment management fees from investment vehicles based on 1 a percentage of committed capital during the commitment period and after the commitment period ends and 2 a percentage of drawn commitments less the portion of such drawn commitments utilized to acquire investments that have been sold in whole or in part or liquidated except to the extent such drawn commitments are subsequently reinvested in other investments or completely written off. Fees earned for underwriting and due diligence services are based on actual costs incurred. In certain situations, Rialto may earn additional fees when the return on assets managed exceeds contractually established thresholds. Such revenue is only booked when the contract terms are met, the contract is at, or near, completion and the amounts are known and collectability is reasonably assured. Since such revenue is recognized at the end of the life of the investment vehicle, after substantially all of the assets have been sold and investment gains and losses realized, the possibility of claw backs is limited. The Company believes the way it records Rialto management fees revenue is a significant accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of the Rialto segment revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment manages more assets. Loans Receivable Revenue RecognitionAll of the acquired loans for which 1 there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and 2for which it was deemed probable that the Company would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments were accounted under ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, ASC 310-30. For loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, management determined upon acquisition the loans value based on due diligence regarding each of the loans, the underlying properties and the borrowers. The Company determined fair value by discounting the cash flows expected to be collected adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider when determining fair value. Factors considered in the valuation were projected cash flows for the loans, type of loan and related collateral, classification status and current discount rates. Since the estimates are based on projections, all estimates are subjective and can change due to unexpected changes in economic conditions and loan performance.Under ASC 310-30, loans were pooled together according to common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single component interest rate and as aggregate expectation of cash flows. The excess of the cash flows expected to be collected over the cost of the loans acquired is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method. The difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. This difference is neither accreted into income nor recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheets.The Rialto segment periodically evaluates its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on its portfolios. These evaluations require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to those used in the initial estimate of fair value of the loans to allocate purchase price. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield. Increases in the cash flows expected to be collected will generally result in an increase in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans. Decreases in expected cash flows due to further deterioration will generally result in an impairment recognized as a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. Prepayments are treated as a reduction of cash flows expected to be collected and a reduction of contractually required payments such that the nonaccretable difference is not affected94Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  Loans- Revenue Recognition ImpairmentAt November30, 2013 and 2012, there were loans receivable with a carrying value of $83 millionand $403 million, respectively, for which interest income was not being recognized as they were classified as nonaccrual. When forecasted principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated at the loan acquisition date, management classifies the loan as nonaccrual and accounts for these assets in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivable, ASC 310-10. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, any subsequent cash receipt is accounted for using the cost recovery method. In accordance with ASC 310-10, a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events; it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected.A provision for loan losses is recognized when the recorded investment in the loan is in excess of its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined by using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell.Real Estate OwnedReal estate owned REO represents real estate that the Rialto segment has taken control or has effective control of in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition of a property through foreclosure of a loan, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale or at fair value if classified as held-and-used, which becomes the propertys new basis. The fair values of these assets are determined in part by placing reliance on third party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity. The third party appraisals and internally developed analyses are significantly impacted by the local market economy, market supply and demand, competitive conditions and prices on comparable properties, adjusted for date of sale, location, property size, and other factors. Each REO is unique and is analyzed in the context of the particular market where the property is located. In order to establish the significant assumptions for a particular REO, the Company analyzes historical trends, including trends achieved by the Company local homebuilding operations, if applicable, and current trends in the market and economy impacting the REO. Using available trend information, the Company then calculates its best estimate of fair value, which can include projected cash flows discounted at a rate the Company believes a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. These methods use unobservable inputs to develop fair value for the Companys REO. Due to the volume and variance of unobservable inputs, resulting from the uniqueness of each of the Company REO, the Company does not use a standard range of unobservable inputs with respect to its evaluation of REO. However, for operating properties within REO, the Company may also use estimated cash flows multiplied by a capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the property. For the year ended November30, 2013, the capitalization rates used to estimate fair value ranged from 6%to 12%and varied based on the location of the asset, asset type and occupancy rates for the operating properties.Changes in economic factors, consumer demand and market conditions, among other things, could materially impact estimates used in the third party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties. Thus, estimates can differ significantly from the amounts ultimately realized by the Rialto segment from disposition of these assets. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is less than the REOs fair value net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale, is recorded as an unrealized gain upon foreclosure in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REOs fair value net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale is generally recorded as a provision for loan losses in the Companys consolidated statement of operations.At times, the Company may foreclose on a loan from an accrual loan pool in which the removal of the loan does not cause an overall decrease in the expected cash flows of the loan pool, and as such, no provision for loan losses is required to be recorded. However, the amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REOs fair value net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale is recorded as an unrealized loss upon foreclosure.Additionally, REO includes real estate which Rialto has purchased directly from financial institutions. These REOs are recorded at cost or allocated cost if purchased in a bulk transaction.Subsequent to obtaining REO via foreclosure or directly from a financial institution, management periodically performs valuations using the methodologies described above such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its cost basis or current fair value, less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale, or at the lower of its cost basis or current fair value if classified as held-and-used. Any subsequent valuation adjustments, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in Rialto other income expense, net. REO assets classified as held-and-used are depreciated using a useful life of forty years for commercial properties and twenty seven and a half years for residential properties. REO assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated. Occasionally an asset will require certain improvements 95Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedto yield a higher return. In accordance with ASC 970-340-25, Real Estate, construction costs incurred prior to acquisition or during development, including improvements of the asset, may be capitalized.Rialto Mortgage FinanceLoans held-for-sale and Derivative Instruments The originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held-for-sale on the consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at fair value. The Company elected the fair value option for Rialto Mortgage Finance RMF loans held-for-sale in accordance with ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Management believes that carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments, which are also carried at fair value, used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded within Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in a securitization on a servicing released, non-recourse basis; although, the Company remains liable for certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales.Consolidations of Variable Interest EntitiesIn 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40%managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies LLCs, in partnership with the FDIC. The Company determined that each of the LLCs met the definition of a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, Consolidations, ASC 810-10-65-2, the Company identified the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance and determined that it has the power to direct those activities. The economic performance of the LLCs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the LLCs portfolios of assets, which consisted primarily of distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans. Thus, the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance are the servicing and disposition of mortgage loans and real estate obtained through foreclosure of loans, restructuring of loans, or other planned activities associated with the monetizing of loans.The FDIC does not have the unilateral power to terminate the Companys role in managing the LLCs and servicing the loan portfolio. While the FDIC has the right to prevent certain types of transactions i.e., bulk sales, selling assets with recourse back to the selling entity, selling assets with representations and warranties and financing the sales of assets without the FDICs approval, the FDIC does not have full voting or blocking rights over the LLCs activities, making their voting rights protective in nature, not substantive participating voting rights. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, which are not the primary activities of the LLCs, the Company can cause the LLCs to enter into both the disposition and restructuring of loans without any involvement of the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC has no voting rights with regard to the operation/management of the operating properties that are acquired upon foreclosure of loans e.g. REO and no voting rights over the business plans of the LLCs. The FDIC can make suggestions regarding the business plans, but the Company can decide not to follow the FDICs suggestions and not to incorporate them in the business plans. Since the FDICs voting rights are protective in nature and not substantive participating voting rights, the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance.In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, the Company determined that it had an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs or the right to receive benefits from the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs based on the following factors:Rialto/Lennar owns 40%of the equity of the LLCs and has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact their economic performance through loan resolutions and the sale of REO.Rialto/Lennar has a management/servicer contract under which the Company earns a 05%servicing fee.Rialto/Lennar has guaranteed, as the servicer, its obligations under the servicing agreement up to $10 million.The Company is aware that the FDIC, as the owner of 60%of the equity of each of the LLCs, may also have an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs. However, in accordance with ASC Topic 810-10-25-38A, only one enterprise, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE.Since both criteria for consolidation in ASC 810-10-65-2 are met, the Company consolidated the LLCs96Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedLennar MultifamilyManagement Fees RevenueThe Lennar Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and management of rental projects in joint ventures in which the Company has investments. As a result, the Lennar Multifamily Segment earns and receives fees, which are based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs. These fees are included in Multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.New Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either 1a continuous statement of comprehensive income or 2two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 was effective for the Companys quarter ended February 28, 2013. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 did not have a material effect on the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements, but required a change in the presentation of the Companys comprehensive income from the notes of the consolidated financial statements to the face of the consolidated financial statements.In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, ASU 2011-08, which amends the guidance in ASC 350-20, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Goodwill. Under ASU 2011-08, entities have the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined, based on qualitative factors, to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then entities are required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. ASU 2011-08 was effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities,ASU 2011-11. which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements of financial instruments and derivative instruments. In January 2013, this guidance was amended by ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting assets and Liabilities ASU 2013-01. ASU 2013-01 limits the scope of ASU 2011-11 to certain derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and lending transactions. The guidance is effective for the Company fiscal year beginning December1, 2013 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.In April 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-04, Liabilities,ASU 2013-04. ASU 2013-04 provides guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date. ASU 2013-04 will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2014 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2013-04 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists,ASU 2013-11.

Operating and Reporting SegmentsThe Companys operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography and product type. The Companys reportable segments consist of:1Homebuilding East2Homebuilding Central3Homebuilding West4Homebuilding Southeast Florida5Homebuilding Houston6Financial Services7Rialto Investments8Lennar MultifamilyThe Company Lennar Multifamily operations has been separated into its own reportable segment as those operations have continued to expand in 2013 and although not significant the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of Lennar Multifamily and how resources are allocated to it, separately from the Company homebuilding other operations. Information about homebuilding activities in which the Companys homebuilding activities are not economically similar to other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings loss before income taxes. Operations of the Companys homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Companys unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings loss for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities and other income, net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and other interest expense of the segment. The Companys reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have operations located in:East:Florida1, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and VirginiaCentral:Arizona, Colorado and Texas2West:California and NevadaSoutheast Florida:Southeast FloridaHouston:Houston, TexasOther:Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington1Florida in the East reportable segment excludes Southeast Florida, which is its own reportable segment2Texas in the Central reportable segment excludes Houston, Texas, which is its own reportable segment.Operations of the Lennar Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of the Companys homes and others. Substantially all of the loans the Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Lennar Financial Services operating earnings consist of revenues generated primarily from mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services, less the cost of such services and certain selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment. The Lennar Financial Services segment operates generally in the same states as the Companys homebuilding operations, as well as in other states.Operations of the Rialto segment include raising, investing and managing third party capital, originating and securitizing commercial mortgage loans, as well as investing its own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities. Rialto utilizes its vertically-integrated investment and operating platform to underwrite, diligence, acquire, manage, workout and add value to diverse portfolios of real estate loans, properties and securities, as well as providing strategic real estate capital. Rialtos operating earnings consists of revenues generated primarily from accretable interest income associated with portfolios of real estate loans acquired in partnership with the FDIC and other portfolios of real estate loans and assets acquired, gains from securitization transactions and interest income from the new RMF business, asset management, due diligence and underwriting fees derived from the segment investments in the real estate investment funds managed by the Rialto segment, fees for sub-advisory services, other income expense, net, consisting primarily of gains upon foreclosure of real estate owned REO and gains on sale of REO, and equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities, less the costs incurred by the segment for managing portfolios, costs related to RMF, REO expenses and other general and administrative expenses98Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  of the Lennar Multifamily segment include revenues generated from the sales of land and management fees generated from joint ventures less the cost of sales of land, equity in loss from unconsolidated entities and general and administrative expenses.Each reportable segment follows the same accounting policies described in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for accounts receivable. Mortgages and notes receivable arising from the sale of land are generally collateralized by the property sold to the buyer. Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses based on historical experience, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Company4. Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesSummarized condensed financial information on a combined 100%basis related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:Statements of OperationsYears Ended November30,In  and  income14,60210,515123,007Net earnings loss of unconsolidated  Homebuilding equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated  the year ended November30, 2013, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities includes $198 millionof equity in earnings primarily as a result of sales of homesites to third parties by one unconsolidated entity.

The basis difference is primarily as a result of the Company buying an interest in a partner equity in a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity at a discount to book value and contributing non-monetary assets to an unconsolidated entity with a higher fair value than book value. The Companys partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. The unconsolidated entities follow accounting principles that are in all material respects the same as those used by the Company. The Company shares in the profits and losses of these unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the day-to-day manager under the direction of a management committee that has shared powers amongst the partners of the unconsolidated entities and receives management fees and/or reimbursement of expenses for performing this function. During the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011, the Company received management fees and reimbursement of expenses from the Homebuilding unconsolidated entities totaling $188 million, $206 millionand $338 million, respectively.During 2011, a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity was restructured. As part of the restructuring, the development management agreement the Agreement between the Company and the unconsolidated entity was terminated and a general release agreement was executed whereby the Company was released from any and all obligations, except any future potential third-party claims, associated with the Agreement. As a result of the restructuring, the termination of the Agreement and the execution of the general release agreement, the Company recognized $100 millionof deferred management fees related to management services previously performed by the Company prior to November30, 2010. The Company is not providing any other services to the unconsolidated entity associated with the deferred management fees recognized.The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when the Company receives the options. During the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011, $1925 million, $1303 millionand $1128 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to the Company. The Company does not include in its Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities its pro rata share of unconsolidated entities earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of the Companys share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until the Company delivers a home and title passes to a third-party homebuyer.In fiscal 2007, the Company sold a portfolio of land to a strategic land investment venture with Morgan Stanley Real Estate FundII, L.P., an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Co., Inc., in which the Company has a 20%ownership interest and 50%voting rights. Due to the Companys continuing involvement, the transaction did not qualify as a sale by the Company under GAAP; thus, the inventory has remained on the Companys consolidated balance sheet in consolidated inventory not owned. As of November30, 2013and 2012, the portfolio of land including land development costs of $2418 millionand $2649 million, respectively, is reflected as inventory in the summarized condensed financial information related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities105Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, the Company and its partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities.The summary of the Companys net recourse exposure related to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments was as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Several recourse debt - repayment$25,99648,020Joint and several recourse debt - repayment15,00018,695The Companys maximum recourse exposure40,99666,715Less: joint and several reimbursement agreements with the Companys partners13,50016,826The Companys net recourse exposure$27,49649,889During the year ended November30, 2013, the Company maximum recourse exposure related to indebtedness of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities decreased by $257 million, as a result of $59 millionpaid by the Company primarily through capital contributions to unconsolidated entities and $198 millionprimarily related to the joint ventures selling assets and other transactions.Indebtedness of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt to different unconsolidated entities. The Company also does not use its investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt in another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities.In connection with loans to a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, the Company and its partners often guarantee to a lender either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any, or all of the following: ithe completion of the development, in whole or in part, iiindemnification of the lender from environmental issues, iiiindemnification of the lender from bad boy acts of the unconsolidated entity or full recourse liability in the event of unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy and ivthat the loan to value and/or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage maintenance or remargining guarantee or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid repayment guarantee.In connection with loans to a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity where there is a joint and several guarantee, the Company generally has a reimbursement agreement with its partner. The reimbursement agreement provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee. However, if the Lennar Homebuildings joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, the Company may be liable for more than its proportionate share, up to its maximum recourse exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee.If the joint ventures are unable to reduce their debt, where there is recourse to the Company, through the sale of inventory or other means, then the Company and its partners may be required to contribute capital to the joint ventures.The recourse debt exposure in the previous table represents the Companys maximum recourse exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are available to repay the debt or to reimburse the Company for any payments on its guarantees. The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities that have recourse debt have significant amount of assets and equity. The summarized balance sheets of the Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities with recourse debt were as follows:November30,In  addition, in most instances in which the Company has guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, the Companys partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payments. Some of the Companys guarantees are repayment guarantees and some are maintenance guarantees. In a repayment guarantee, the Company and its venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of default 106Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedbefore the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. In the event of default, if the Companys venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, the Company may be liable for more than its proportionate share, up to its maximum recourse exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value or the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If the Company is required to make a payment under a maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the remaining loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase the Companys investment in the unconsolidated entity and its share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes. As of November30, 2013, the Company does not have any maintenance guarantees related to its Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, the Company and its joint venture partners or entities related to them have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used.During the year ended November30, 2013, there were other loan paydowns relating to recourse debt of $61 million. During the year ended November30, 2012, there were other loan paydowns of $57 million, a portion of which related to amounts paid under the Companys repayment guarantees. During the years ended November30, 2013and 2012, there were nopayments under completion guarantees. Payments made to, or on behalf of, the Companys unconsolidated entities, including payment made under guarantees, are recorded primarily as capital contributions to the Companys Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.As of November30, 2013, the fair values of the repayment guarantees and completion guarantees were not material. The Company believes that as of November30, 2013, in the event it becomes legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, most of the time the collateral should be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or the Company and its partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, the Company has placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for its joint ventures see Note 6.The total debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments was as follows:November30,Dollars In thousands20132012The Companys net recourse  agreements from partners13,50016,826The Companys maximum recourse  bank debt and other debt partners share of several  land seller debt or other debt20,45426,340Non-recourse debt with completion  debt without completion  debt to the Company409,461690,858Total debt$450,457757,573The Companys maximum recourse exposure as a % of total JV debt9%9%107Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued5.

As of November30, 2013, the Company had nooutstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The Company believes it was in compliance with its debt covenants at November30, 2013.During the year ended November30, 2013, the Company terminated $200 millionof letter of credit and reimbursement agreements with certain financial institutions.The Companys performance letters of credit outstanding were $1606 millionand $1075 million, respectively, at November30, 2013and 2012. The Companys financial letters of credit outstanding were $2128 millionand $2047 million, respectively, at November30, 2013and 2012. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the Companys performance of certain development and construction activities, and financial letters of credit are 108Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November30, 2013, the Company had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects including certain projects of the Companys joint ventures of $6793 million. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. As of November30, 2013, there were approximately $4454 million, or 66%, of costs to complete related to these site improvements. The Company does not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds, but if any such draws occur, the Company does not believe they would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The LLCs hold performing and non-performing loans formerly owned by 22failed financial institutions and when the Rialto segment acquired its interests in the LLCs, the twoportfolios consisted of approximately 5,500distressed residential and commercial real estate loans FDIC Portfolios. The FDIC retained a 60%equity interest in the LLCs and provided $6269 millionof financing with 0%interest, which were non-recourse to the Company and the LLCs. In accordance with GAAP, interest was not imputed because the notes were with, and guaranteed by, a governmental agency. The notes were secured by the loans held by the LLCs. If the LLCs exceed expectations and meet certain internal rate of return and distribution thresholds, the Companys equity interest in the LLCs could be reduced from 40%down to 30%, with a corresponding increase to the FDICs equity interest from 60%up to 70%. As of November30, 2013, the notes payable had been fully paid and the remaining cash collected on the loans and REO properties, net of expenses and other items was being shared 60%/ 40%with the FDIC. As of November30, 2012, the notes payable balance was $4700 million, however, $2238 millionof cash collections on loans in excess of expenses were deposited in a defeasance account, established for the repayment of the notes payable, under the agreement with the FDIC. The funds in the defeasance account were used to retire the notes payable upon their maturity. During the years ended November30, 2013and 2012, the LLCs retired $4700 millionand $1569 million, respectively, principal amount of the notes payable under the agreement with the FDIC through the defeasance account.

The Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary because it has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact the LLCs performance through Rialto management and servicer contracts. At November30, 2013, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of $7271 millionand $202 million, respectively. At November30, 2012, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of $12 billionand $05 billion, respectively.In September 2010, the Rialto segment acquired approximately 400distressed residential and commercial real estate loans Bank Portfolios and over 300REO properties from threefinancial institutions.

In accordance with ASC 310-30, the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. This difference is neither accreted into income nor recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the cost of the loans acquired is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method.The Rialto segment periodically evaluates its estimate of cash flows expected to be collected on its FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios. These evaluations require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates, similar to those used in the initial estimate of fair value of the loans to allocate purchase price. Subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield. Increases in the cash flows expected to be collected will generally result in an increase in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans. Decreases in expected cash flows will generally result in an impairment charge recognized as a provision for loan losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.The outstanding balance and carrying value of loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 was as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Outstanding principal  value$270,075396,200The activity in the accretable yield for the FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios for the years ended November30, 2013and 2012was as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Accretable yield, beginning of  yield, end of year$73,144112,899Additions primarily represent reclasses from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield on the portfolios. Deletions represent loan impairments and disposal of loans, which includes foreclosure of underlying collateral and result in the removal of the loans from the accretable yield portfolios.When forecasted principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated at the loan acquisition date, management classifies the loan as nonaccrual and accounts for these assets in accordance with ASC 310-10, ReceivablesASC 310-10. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, any subsequent cash receipt is accounted for using the cost recovery method. In accordance with ASC 310-10, a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. Although these loans met the definition of ASC 310-10, these loans were not considered impaired relative to the Companys recorded investment at the time 116Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedof the acquisition since they were acquired at a substantial discount to their unpaid principal balance. A provision for loan losses is recognized when the recorded investment in the loan is in excess of its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined by using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. The following table represents nonaccrual loans in the FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios accounted for under ASC 310-10 aggregated by collateral type:November30, 2013Recorded InvestmentIn  family   receivable,  2012Recorded InvestmentIn  family   receivable,  average recorded investment in impaired loans totaled approximately $24 millionand $57 million, respectively, for the years ended November30, 2013and 2012.The loans receivable portfolios consist of loans acquired at a discount. Based on the nature of these loans, the portfolios are managed by assessing the risks related to the likelihood of collection of payments from borrowers and guarantors, as well as monitoring the value of the underlying collateral. The following are the risk categories for the loans receivable portfolios:Accrual Loans in which forecasted cash flows under the loan agreement, as it might be modified from time to time, can be reasonably estimated at the date of acquisition. The risk associated with loans in this category relates to the possible default by the borrower with respect to principal and interest payments and/or the possible decline in value of the underlying collateral and thus, both could cause a decline in the forecasted cash flows used to determine accretable yield income and the recognition of an impairment through an allowance for loan losses. As of November30, 2013, the Company allowance rollforward related to accrual loans was as follows: November30,In thousands20132012Allowance on accrual loans, beginning of year$12,178Provision for loan  on accrual loans, end of year$18,95212,178Nonaccrual Loans in which forecasted principal and interest could not be reasonably estimated at the date of acquisition. Although the Company believes the recorded investment balance will ultimately be realized, the risk of nonaccrual loans relates to a decline in the value of the collateral securing the outstanding obligation and the recognition of an impairment through an allowance for loan losses if the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell. As of November30, 2013, the Company allowance rollforward related to nonaccrual loans was as follows: 117Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  thousands20132012Allowance on nonaccrual loans, beginning of year$3,722801Provision for loan  nonaccrual loans, end of year$1,2133,722Accrual and nonaccrual loans receivable, net by risk categories were as follows:November30, 2013In  family   receivable,  2012In  family    receivable, net$396,20040,335436,535In order to assess the risk associated with each risk category, the Rialto segment evaluates the forecasted cash flows and the value of the underlying collateral securing loans receivable on a quarterly basis or when an event occurs that suggests a decline in the collaterals fair value.Real Estate OwnedThe acquisition of properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are reported within the consolidated balance sheets as REO held-and-used, net and REO held-for-sale. When a property is determined to be held-and-used, the asset is recorded at fair value and depreciated over its useful life using the straight line method. When certain criteria set forth in ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, are met; the property is classified as held-for-sale. When a real estate asset is classified as held-for-sale, the property is recorded at the lower of its cost basis or fair value less estimated costs to sell. The fair values of REO held-for-sale are determined in part by placing reliance on third party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity118Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe following tables present the activity in REO for the years ended November30, 2013and 2012:November30,In thousands20132012REO - held-for-sale, beginning of  to/from held-and-used, net 1247,397146,059Transfers to Lennar  - held-for-sale, end of year$197,851134,161November 30,In thousands20132012REO - held-and-used, net, beginning of  to/from held-for-sale 1247,397146,059REO - held-and-used, net, end of year$428,989601,0221During the years ended November30, 2013and 2012, the Rialto segment transferred certain properties to/from REO held-and-used, net to/from REO held-for-sale as a result of changes made in the disposition strategy of the real estate assets.For the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011, the Company recorded $488 million, $216 millionand $60 million, respectively, of net gains from sales of REO.

The Rialto segment classified these securities as held-to-maturity based on its intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity.In a CMBS transaction, monthly interest received from all of the pooled loans is paid to the investors, starting with those investors holding the highest rated bonds and progressing in an order of seniority based on the class of security. Based on the aforementioned, the principal and interest repayments of a particular class are dependent upon collections on the underlying mortgages, which are affected by prepayments, extensions and defaults.Another subsidiary in the Rialto segment also has approximately a 5%investment in a service and infrastructure provider to the residential home loan market the Service Provider, which provides loan servicing support for all of Rialto owned and managed portfolios and asset management services for Rialto small balance loan program.

Fund IIs objective during its three-year investment period is to invest in distressed real estate assets and other related investments that fit within Fund IIs investment parameters. As of November30, 2013, the equity commitments of Fund II were $11 billion, including the $100 millionby the Company.

As of November30, 2013, the carrying value of the Company investment in Fund II was $531 million. For the year ended November30, 2013, the Companys share of earnings from Fund II was $25 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2013, Fund II was closed to additional commitments, with equity commitments totaling $13 billion.In 2013, the Rialto segment started raising capital and investing in mezzanine commercial loans creating the Rialto Mezzanine Partners Fund the Mezzanine Fund with a target of raising $300 millionin capital to invest in performing mezzanine commercial loans. These loans have expected durations of oneto twoyears and are secured by equity interests in the borrowing entity owning the real estate. As of November 30, 2013, the Mezzanine Fund had total equity commitments of $82 million, including $25 millioncommitted by the Company. As of November 30, 2013, capital invested in the Mezzanine Fund was $535 million, including $164 millioninvested by the Company. For the year ended November 30, 2013, the Company share of earnings was $04 million.Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund are unconsolidated entities and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. They were determined to have the attributes of an investment company in accordance with ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies, the attributes of which are different from the attributes that would cause a company to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Funds assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value with increases/decreases in fair value recorded in their respective statement of operations, the Companys share of which will be recorded in the Rialto equity in earnings loss from 120Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  entities financial statement line item. The Company determined that Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund are not a variable interest entities but rather voting interest entities due to the following factors:The Company determined that Rialtos general partner interest and all the limited partners interests qualify as equity investment at risk.Based on the capital structure of Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund 100% capitalized via equity contributions, the Company was able to conclude that the equity investment at risk was sufficient to allow Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.The general partner and the limited partners in Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund, collectively, have full decision-making ability as they collectively have the power to direct the activities of Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund, since Rialto, in addition to being a general partner with a substantive equity investment in Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund, also provides services to Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund under a management agreement and an investment agreement, which are not separable from Rialtos general partnership interest.As a result of all these factors, the Company has concluded that the power to direct the activities of Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund reside in its general partnership interest and thus with the holders of the equity investment at risk.In addition, there are no guaranteed returns provided to the equity investors and the equity contributions are fully subjected to Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund operational results, thus the equity investors absorb the expected negative and positive variability relative to Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund.Finally, substantially all of the activities of Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund are not conducted on behalf of any individual investor or related group that has disproportionately few voting rights i.e., on behalf of any individual limited partner.Having concluded that Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund are voting interest entities, the Company has evaluated the funds under the voting interest entity model to determine whether, as general partner, it has control over Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund. The Company determined that it does not control Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund as its general partner, because the unaffiliated limited partners have substantial kick-out rights and can remove Rialto as general partner at any time for cause or without cause through a simple majority vote of the limited partners. In addition, there are no significant barriers to the exercise of these rights. As a result of determining that the Company does not control Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund under the voting interest entity model, Fund I, Fund II and the Mezzanine Fund are not consolidated in the Companys financial statements.In addition to the acquisition and management of the FDIC and Bank portfolios, an affiliate in the Rialto segment was a sub-advisor to the AllianceBernstein L.P. AB fund formed under the Federal governments Public-Private Investment Program PPIP to purchase real estate related securities from banks and other financial institutions. The sub-advisor received management fees for sub-advisory services. At the end of 2012, the AB PPIP fund finalized the last sales of the underlying securities in the fund and made substantially all of the final liquidating distributions to the partners, including the Company. As the Companys role as sub-advisor to the AB PPIP fund has been completed, no further management fees will be received for these services. During the year ended November30, 2012, the Company contributed $19 millionand received distributions of $876 million. Of the distributions received during the year ended November 30, 2012, $835 millionrelated to the unwinding of the AB PPIP fund operations. The Company also earned $91 millionin fees from the segment role as a sub-advisor to the AB PPIP fund, which were included in the Rialto segment revenues.

The Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Lennar Multifamily segment unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities, the Company or entities related to them have been required to give guarantees of completion and cost over-runs to the lenders and partners. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used. Additionally, the Company guarantees the construction costs of the project. All construction cost over-runs would be paid by the Company. As of November30, 2013and 2012, Lennar Multifamily segment unconsolidated entities had non-recourse debt with completion guarantees was $516 millionand $22 million, respectively123Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  condensed financial information on a combined 100%basis related to Lennar Multifamily investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:Balance SheetsNovember30,In thousands20132012Assets:Cash and cash equivalents$5,800674Operating properties and equipment236,52820,647Other  and equity:Accounts payable and other liabilities$11,147909Notes  of OperationsYears Ended November30,In  and expenses1,49329Net loss of unconsolidated entities$1,49329Lennar Multifamily equity in loss from unconsolidated entities$271410.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred tax assets are as follows:November30,In thousands20132012Deferred tax assets:Inventory valuation  and accruals125,75698,076Net operating loss   in unconsolidated entities1,012Other assets29,01727,570Total deferred tax assets527,429727,328Valuation  deferred tax assets after valuation  tax liabilities:Capitalized  debt basis difference11,68417,243Rialto  in unconsolidated  deferred tax liabilities137,925170,973Net deferred tax assets$376,799467,561A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required, if based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. In the assessment for a valuation allowance, appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Companys experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.During the years ended November 30, 2013 and 2012, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the majority of its deferred tax assets would be utilized. This conclusion in 2012 was based on a detailed evaluation of all relevant evidence, both positive and negative. The positive evidence included factors such as 11consecutive quarters of earnings, the expectation of continued earnings and evidence of a sustained recovery in the housing markets that the Company operates. In 2013, additional positive evidence included actual and forecasted profitability, as well as, the Company generating cumulative pre-tax earnings over a rolling fouryear period including the pre-tax earnings achieved during 2013. See Note 1 for additional information related to the Company analysis of the utilization of its deferred tax assets.Accordingly, for the year ended November30, 2013, the Company reversed $671 millionof its valuation allowance primarily against its state deferred tax assets. This reversal was offset by a tax provision of $2441 million, primarily related to pre-tax earnings during the year ended November30, 2013, resulting in a $1770 millionprovision for income taxes for the year ended November30, 2013. As of November30, 2013, the Company remaining valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was $127 million, which is primarily related to state net operating loss carryforwards that may expire due to short carryforward periods. A valuation allowance remains on some of the Company state net operating loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized at this time due to an inability to carry back these losses in most states and short carryforward periods that exist in certain states. In future periods, the remaining allowance could be reversed if additional sufficient positive evidence is present indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the Company remaining deferred tax assets will be realized.

During the year ended November30, 2012, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $4352 million, primarily related to the reversal of the Company valuation allowance. As of November30, 2012, the Company remaining valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets was $888 million. The Company deferred tax assets, net, were $4676 millionat November30, 2012.At November30, 2013and 2012, the Company had federal tax effected NOL carryforwards totaling $881 millionand $2789 million, respectively, that may be carried forward up to 20years to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2025. As of November30, 2013, the Company needs to generate $2518 millionof pre-tax earnings in future periods to realize all of its federal NOL carryforwards and an additional $3991 millionof pre-tax earnings to utilize its net federal deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary tax differences. At November30, 2013and 2012, the Company had state tax effected NOL carryforwards totaling $1436 millionand $1736 million, respectively, that may be carried forward from 5to 20years, depending on the tax jurisdiction, with losses expiring between 2013 and 2032. As of November30, 2013, state tax effected NOL carryforwards totaling $27 millionmay expire over the next twelve months, if sufficient taxable income is not generated to utilize the NOLs. At November30, 2013and 2012, the Company had a valuation allowance of $106 millionand $846 million, respectively, against its state NOL carryforwards because the Company believes it is more likely than not that a portion of its state NOL carryforwards will not be realized due to the limited carryforward periods in certain states.A reconciliation of the statutory rate and the effective tax rate was as  rate3500%3500%3500%State income taxes, net of federal income tax  compensation040286Tax reserves and interest expense056500008Deferred tax asset valuation  credits045010944Net operating loss adjustment   During the year ended November 30, 2012, the Company recorded adjustments to its NOL carryforwards as a result of the conclusion of an IRS examination and additional state net operating losses generated from tax returns filed during the current year, resulting in a reduction to the Company effective tax rate.The following table summarizes the changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits:Years Ended November30,In thousands201320122011Gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of  due to tax positions taken during current period1,982Increases due to settlements with taxing authorities9,470Decreases due to settlements with taxing  due to change in state tax laws5,167Gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year$10,45912,29736,739At November30, 2013and 2012, the Company had $105 millionand $123 million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

The increasein gross unrecognized tax benefits related to the state tax position increased the Company effective tax rate from 2671%to 2696%. As a result of the reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company deferred tax assets, the effective tax rate is not reflective of the Company historical tax rate.During the year ended November30, 2012, the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $244 millionprimarily as a result of the resolution of an IRS examination, which included a settlement for certain losses carried back to prior years and the settlement of certain tax accounting method items.

This program operates as a contemporaneous exam throughout the year in order to keep exam cycles current and achieve a higher level of compliance. 11. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.All outstanding nonvested shares that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents that participate in undistributed earnings with common stock are considered participating securities and are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and participation rights in undistributed earnings.

The Company may also make contributions for the benefit of associates. The Company records as compensation expense its contribution to the Plan. For the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011, this amount was $80 million, $62 millionand $50 million, respectively14. Share-Based PaymentsThe Company has share-based awards outstanding under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, which provides for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock nonvested shares to key officers, associates and directors. These awards are primarily issued in the form of new shares. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than tenyears after the date of the grant.Cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for those options excess tax benefits are classified as financing cash flows. For the year ended November30, 2013there was $101 millionof excess tax benefits from share based awards. For the year ended November30, 2012there was $108 millionof excess tax benefits from share based awards and for the years ended November30, 2011there was an immaterial amount of excess tax benefits from share-based awards.Compensation expense related to the Companys share-based awards was as follows:Years ended November30,In thousands201320122011Stock  shares33,55929,31219,665Total compensation expense for share-based awards$33,68931,74524,047Cash received from stock options exercised during the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011was $167 million, $265 million, and $62 million, respectively. The tax benefit related to stock options exercised during the years ended November30, 2013, 2012, and 2011were $120 million, $148 millionand $08 million, respectively.The fair value of each of the Companys stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. The fair value of the Companys stock option awards, which are subject to graded vesting, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock over the most recent period equal to the expected life of the award. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the stock option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award granted. The Company uses historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within its valuation model. The expected life of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the Companys share-based payment plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding129Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe fair value of these options was determined at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended November30, 2013, 2012, and 2011was $308 million, $381 millionand $21 million, respectively. The fair value of nonvested shares is determined based on the trading price of the Companys common stock on the grant date. The weighted average fair value of nonvested shares granted during the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011was $3504, $3062and $1840, respectively.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value DisclosuresThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at November30, 2013and 2012, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The table excludes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, defeasance cash to retire notes payable, receivables, net, and accounts payable, which had fair values approximating their carrying amounts due to the short maturities and liquidity of these    Investments:Loans receivable, netLevel  held-to-maturityLevel  Financial Services:Loans held-for-investment, netLevel  held-to-maturityLevel  Homebuilding:Senior notes and other debts payableLevel  Investments:Notes payable and other debts payableLevel  Financial Services:Notes and other debts payableLevel  Multifamily:Notes and other debts payableLevel 2$13,85813,858The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar MultifamilyFor senior notes and other debts payable, the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings is based on quoted market prices and the fair value of variable-rate borrowings is based on expected future cash flows calculated using current market forward rates.Rialto InvestmentsThe fair values for loans receivable, net is based on discounted cash flows, or the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell. The fair value for investments held-to-maturity is based on discounted cash flows. For notes payable, the fair value of the zeropercent interest notes guaranteed by the FDIC, which was paid off during 2013, was calculated based on a 2-year treasury yield in 2012, and the fair value of other notes payable was calculated based on discounted cash flows using the Companys weighted average borrowing rate for both 2013 and 2012.Lennar Financial ServicesThe fair values above are based on quoted market prices, if available. The fair values for instruments that do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other financial information.Fair Value MeasurementsGAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosures about fair value measurements and establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value summarized as follows:Level 1:Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.Level 2:Fair value determined using significant other observable inputs.Level 3:Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs131Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Companys financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:Financial InstrumentsIn  Value at November 30, 2013Fair Value at November 30, 2012Lennar Financial Services:Loans held-for-sale  loan commitmentsLevel 2$7,33512,713Forward contractsLevel 2$1,4442,570Lennar Homebuilding:Investments available-for-saleLevel 3$40,03219,591Rialto Investments Assets:Loans held-for-sale 2Level 3$44,228Credit default swapsLevel 2$788Rialto Investments Liabilities:Interest rate swap futuresLevel 1$31Credit default swapsLevel 2$3181The aggregate fair value of Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale of $4142 millionat November30, 2013exceeds their aggregate principal balance of $3990 millionby $153 million.

Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale Fair value is based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. Management believes carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. In addition, the Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale as of November30, 2013and 2012. Fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics.Lennar Financial Services mortgage loan commitments Fair value of commitments to originate loans is based upon the difference between the current value of similar loans and the price at which the Lennar Financial Services segment has committed to originate the loans. The fair value of commitments to sell loan contracts is the estimated amount that the Lennar Financial Services segment would receive or pay to terminate the commitments at the reporting date based on market prices for similar financial instruments. In addition, the Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics. The fair value of the mortgage loan commitments and related servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services other assets as of November30, 2013and 2012. Lennar Financial Services Forward contracts Fair value is based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments.Lennar Homebuilding investments available-for-sale The fair value of these investments are based on the third party valuations and/or estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows.Rialto Investments loans held-for-sale The fair value of loans held-for-sale is calculated from model-based techniques that use discounted cash flow assumptions and the Companys own estimates of CMBS spreads, market interest rate 132Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  and the underlying loan credit quality. Loan values are calculated by allocating the change in value of an assumed CMBS capital structure to each loan. The value of an assumed CMBS capital structure is calculated, generally, by discounting the cash flows associated with each CMBS class at market interest rates and at the Companys own estimate of CMBS spreads. The Company estimates CMBS spreads by observing the pricing of recent CMBS offerings, secondary CMBS markets, changes in the CMBX index, and general capital and commercial real estate market conditions. Considerations in estimating CMBS spreads include comparing the Companys current loan portfolio with comparable CMBS offerings containing loans with similar duration, credit quality and collateral composition. These methods use unobservable inputs in estimating a discount rate that is used to assign a value to each loan. While the cash payments on the loans are contractual, the discount rate used and assumptions regarding the relative size of each class in the CMBS capital structure can significantly impact the valuation. Therefore, the estimates used could differ materially from the fair value determined when the loans are sold to a securitization trust.Rialto Investments interest rate swap futures The fair value of interest rate swap futures derivatives is based on quoted market prices for identical investments traded in active markets.Rialto Investments credit default swaps The fair value of credit default swaps derivatives is based on quoted market prices for similar investments traded in active markets.Gains and losses of Lennar Financial Services financial instruments measured at fair value from initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in the Lennar Financial Services segments operating earnings. Gains of Rialto financial instruments measured at fair value are recognized in the Rialto segment operating earnings Gains and losses related to the Lennar Homebuilding investments available-for-sale during the year ended November30, 2013were deferred as a result of the Company continuing involvement in the underlying real estate collateral. There were no gains or losses recognized for the Lennar Homebuilding investments available-for-sale during the years ended November 30, 2012. The changes in fair values that are included in operating earnings are shown, by financial instrument and financial statement line item below:Years Ended November30,In thousands201320122011Changes in fair value included in Lennar Financial Services revenues:Loans  loan   in fair value included in Rialto Investments revenues:Financial Assets:Loans held-for-sale$33Credit default swaps$788Financial Liabilities:Interest rate swap futures$31Credit default swaps$318Interest income on Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale and Rialto Investments loans held-for-sale measured at fair value is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and recorded as revenues in the Lennar Financial Services statement of operations and Rialto Investments statement of operations, respectively.The Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities MBS forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge its mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting the Companys counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting the Companys credit standards. The segments risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At November30, 2013, the segment had open commitments amounting to $5330 millionto sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2014.The following table represents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for the Companys Level 3 recurring fair value measurements investments available-for-sale included in the Lennar Homebuilding segments other assets:133Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedYears Ended November 30,In thousands20132012Investments available-for-sale, beginning of year$19,591$42,892Purchases and other  in fair value 2748Settlements 320734,559Investments available-for-sale, end of  investments in community development district bonds that mature at various dates between 2022 and 20422Amount represents changes in fair value during the year ended November30, 2013.

Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesGAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: athe power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and bthe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.The Companys variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of 1equity ownership, 2contracts to purchase assets, 3 management and development agreements between the Company and a VIE, 4loans provided by the Company to a VIE or other partner and/or 5guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. The Company examines specific 136Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedcriteria and uses its judgment when determining if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality, if any, between the Company and the other partners and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs.Generally, all major decision making in the Companys joint ventures is shared by all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by the Company are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between the Company and other partners. Generally, the Company purchases less than a majority of the joint ventures assets and the purchase prices under the Companys option contracts are believed to be at market.Generally, Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partners lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, the Company continues to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions.The Company evaluated the joint venture agreements of its joint ventures that were formed or that had reconsideration events during the year ended November30, 2013. Based on the Companys evaluation, there were no entities that consolidated during the year ended November30, 2013. In addition, during the year ended November30, 2013, there were no VIEs that deconsolidated.At November30, 2013and 2012, the Companys recorded investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities were $7169 millionand $5622 million, respectively, the Rialto segments investments in unconsolidated entities were $1546 millionand $1081 million, respectively, and the Lennar Multifamily segment investments in unconsolidated entities were $463 millionand $31 million, respectively. Consolidated VIEsAs of November30, 2013, the carrying amount of the VIEs assets and non-recourse liabilities that consolidated were $12 billionand $2948 million, respectively. As of November30, 2012, the carrying amount of the VIEs assets and non-recourse liabilities that consolidated were $21 billionand $07 billion, respectively. Those assets are owned by, and those liabilities are obligations of, the VIEs, not the Company.A VIEs assets can only be used to settle obligations of that VIE. The VIEs are not guarantors of Companys senior notes and other debts payable. In addition, the assets held by a VIE usually are collateral for that VIEs debt. The Company and other partners do not generally have an obligation to make capital contributions to a VIE unless the Company and/or the other partners have entered into debt guarantees with a VIEs banks. Other than debt guarantee agreements with a VIEs banks, there are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to a VIE. While the Company has option contracts to purchase land from certain of its VIEs, the Company is not required to purchase the assets and could walk away from the contract.Consolidated Joint VenturesDuring the year ended November30, 2013, the Company had significant transactions involving threeof its consolidated joint ventures. In the first joint venture transaction, the Company bought out its 50%partners for $823 million, paying $188 millionin cash and financing the remainder with a short-term note. The Company consolidated joint venture then contributed certain assets to a new unconsolidated joint venture and brought in a new, long-term partner for $125 million, or a 3125%interest. Additionally, if the new unconsolidated entity meets certain cash flow thresholds, the partner equity interest in the unconsolidated entity could be decreased to 1625%or increased to 4625%with a corresponding increase or decrease in the Company equity interest percentage. During the year ended November30, 2013, the new unconsolidated joint venture subsequently distributed $125 millionof cash to the Company as a return of capital.In the second joint venture transaction, the Company purchased its partner interest for $1532 millionand the inventories are now wholly-owned assets, which the Company plans to develop and build homes. During the year ended November30, 2013, there was a third joint venture transaction where the Company paid off the bank debt of the consolidated joint venture and assumed the partner interest, resulting in the entity becoming wholly-owned.These transactions did not impact the Company net earnings, but its balance sheet was affected as follows: cash was reduced by approximately $47 million, inventory decreased by approximately $225 million, investments in unconsolidated entities increased by $98 million, deferred tax assets were increased by $40 million, additional paid-in capital equity was reduced by $62 million, net of tax, and non-controlling interests were reduced by $134 million137Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  VIEsAt November30, 2013and 2012, the Companys recorded investments in VIEs that are unconsolidated and its estimated maximum exposure to loss were as follows:November30, 2013In thousandsInvestments  Homebuilding 1$195,720301,315Rialto Investments 224,39324,393Lennar Multifamily  2012In thousandsInvestments  to LossLennar Homebuilding 1$82,374101,362Rialto Investments 223,58723,587Lennar Multifamily  November30, 2013, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Homebuildings investments in unconsolidated VIEs is limited to its investment in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to $905 millionremaining commitment to fund a new unconsolidated entity for further expenses up until the unconsolidated entity obtains permanent financing and $150 millionof recourse debt of an unconsolidated VIEs, which is included in the Companys maximum recourse related to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. At November30, 2012, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Homebuildings investments in unconsolidated VIEs is limited to its investment in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to $187 millionof recourse debt of one of the unconsolidated VIEs, which is included in the Companys maximum recourse exposure related to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. 2At both November30, 2013and 2012, the maximum recourse exposure to loss of Rialtos investments in unconsolidated VIEs was limited to its investments in the unconsolidated entities. At November30, 2013and 2012, investments in unconsolidated VIEs and Lennars maximum exposure to loss include $161 millionand $150 million, respectively, related to Rialtos investments held-to-maturity3At November30, 2013, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Multifamily investments in unconsolidated VIEs is limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to $280 millionof letters of credit outstanding for certain of the unconsolidated VIEs that in the event of default under its debt agreement the letter of credit will be drawn upon. At November30, 2012, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Multifamily investments in unconsolidated VIEs is limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to $48 millionof letters of credit outstanding for certain of the unconsolidated VIEs that in the event of default under its debt agreement the letter of credit will drawn upon. While these entities are VIEs, the Company has determined that the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance is generally shared. Further, the Company and its partners are not defacto agents as defined in ASC 810. While the Company generally manages the day-to-day operations of the VIEs, each of these VIEs has an executive committee made up of representatives from each partner. The members of the executive committee have equal votes and major decisions require unanimous consent and approval from all members. The Company does not have the unilateral ability to exercise participating voting rights without partner consent. Furthermore, the Companys economic interest is not significantly disproportionate to the point where it would indicate that the Company has the power to direct these activities.The Company and other partners do not generally have an obligation to make capital contributions to the VIEs, except for $150 millionof recourse debt of one of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated VIEs and $280 millionof letters of credit outstanding for certain of the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated VIEs that in the event of default under its debt agreement the letter of credit will be drawn upon. Except for Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated VIEs discussed above, the Company and the other partners did not guarantee any debt of these unconsolidated VIEs. There are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to the VIEs except 138Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedwith regard to $905 millionremaining commitment to fund a new Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity for further expenses up until the unconsolidated entity obtains permanent financing. While the Company has option contracts to purchase land from certain of its unconsolidated VIEs, the Company is not required to purchase the assets and could walk away from the contracts.Option ContractsThe Company has access to land through option contracts, which generally enables it to control portions of properties owned by third parties including land funds and unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether to exercise the option.A majority of the Companys option contracts require a non-refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. The Companys option contracts sometimes include price adjustment provisions, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at the time of acquisition or are based on the fair value at the time of takedown.The Companys investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case the Companys investments are written down to fair value. The Company reviews option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet the Companys targeted return on investment with appropriate consideration given to the length of time available to exercise the option. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause the Company to re-evaluate the likelihood of exercising its land options.Some option contracts contain a predetermined take-down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, the Company is not required to purchase land in accordance with those take-down schedules. In substantially all instances, the Company has the right and ability to not exercise its option and forfeit its deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of its deposit and pre-acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, the Company does not consider the take-down price to be a firm contractual obligation.When the Company does not intend to exercise an option, it writes off any unapplied deposit and pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract. For the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011, the Company wrote-off $19 million, $24 millionand $18 million, respectively, of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land under option that it does not intend to purchase.The Company evaluates all option contracts for land to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or makes a significant deposit for optioned land, it may need to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During the year ended November30, 2013, the effect of consolidation of these option contracts was a net increase of $1968 millionto consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November30, 2013. The increase was primarily due to a significant nominal dollar deposit placed on the future purchase of homesites. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, the Company reclassified the related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November30, 2013. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and the Companys cash deposits. The increase to consolidated inventory not owned was partially offset by the Company exercising its options to acquire land under previously consolidated contracts, resulting in a net increase in consolidated inventory not owned of $1333 millionfor the year ended November30, 2013.The Companys exposure to loss related to its option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of its non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling $1292 millionand $1767 million, respectively, at November30, 2013and 2012. Additionally, the Company had posted $299 millionand $425 million, respectively, of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November30, 2013and 201217. Commitments and Contingent LiabilitiesThe Company is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a party to various lawsuits involving purchases and sales of real property. These claims include claims regarding representations and warranties made in connection with the transfer of the property and 139Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinueddisputes regarding the obligation to purchase or sell the property. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the financial effect of litigation concerning purchases and sales of property may depend upon the value of the subject property, which may have changed from the time the agreement for purchase or sale was entered into.The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase, development and sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts generally enable the Company to control portions of properties owned by third parties including land funds and unconsolidated entities until the Company determines whether to exercise the option. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At November30, 2013, the Company had $1292 millionof non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites, which were included in inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future minimum payments under the non-cancellable leases in effect at November30, 2013are as follows:In  expense for the years ended November30, 2013, 2012and 2011was $419 million, $387 millionand $400 million, respectively.The Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $3734 millionat November30, 2013. The Company also had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects including certain projects in the Companys joint ventures of $6793 million. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. As of November30, 2013, there were approximately $4454 million, or 66%, of costs to complete related to these site improvements. The Company does not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds that would have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.In December 2013, the Company was awarded by a civil jury compensatory damages and punitive damages against a former unconsolidated joint venture partner on court findings of defamation and conspiracy to extort money from the Company in 2008 and 2009. The Company does not expect to be able to collect the amount awarded to it and thus has not recorded any amounts receivable in its financial statements related to the award140Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued18.

The entities referred to as guarantors in the following tables are subsidiaries that were guaranteeing the senior notes because at November30, 2013they were guaranteeing Lennar Corporation $200 millionLetter of Credit Facility and its Credit Facility. The guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. A subsidiary guarantee will be suspended, and the subsidiary will cease to be a guarantor, at any time when it is not directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least $75 millionprincipal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation, and a subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed of.For purposes of the condensed consolidating statement of cash flows included in the following supplemental financial information, the Company accounting policy is to treat cash received by Lennar Corporation the Parent from its subsidiaries, to the extent of net earnings from such subsidiaries as a dividend and accordingly a return on investment within cash flows from operating activities. The cash outflows associated with the return on investment dividends received by the Parent are reflected by the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor subsidiaries in the Dividends line item within cash flows from financing activities. All other cash flows between the Parent and its subsidiaries represent the settlement of receivables and payables between such entities in conjunction with the Parent centralized cash management arrangement with its subsidiaries, which operates with the characteristics of a revolving credit facility, and are accordingly reflected net in the Intercompany line item within cash flows from investing activities for the Parent and net in the Intercompany line item within cash flows from financing activities for the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor subsidiaries. In connection with the issuance of the Rialto Notes in November 2013, the intercompany liabilities in excess of $235 milliondue to Lennar by Rialto was reclassified to equity in a non-cash transaction, which resulted in the reclassification of approximately $534 millionof Intercompany payables to equity of the non-guarantors as well as Intercompany receivables to investment in subsidiaries of the Parent.Supplemental information for the subsidiaries that were guarantor subsidiaries at November30, 2013was as follows:141Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES

Controls and Procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated in an evaluation by our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter that ended on November30, 2013. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November30, 2013to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or furnished under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our CEO and CFO also participated in an evaluation by our management of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November30, 2013. That evaluation did not identify any changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm obtained from Deloitte Touche LLP relating to the effectiveness of Lennar Corporations internal control over financial reporting are included elsewhere in this document.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework1992,our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November30, 2013. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November30, 2013has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.Item9B. Other Information.Not applicable152Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar CorporationWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of November30, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November30, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November30, 2013of the Company and our report dated January27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements./s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLPCertified Public AccountantsMiami, FloridaJanuary 27, 2014153Table of ContentsPART III
