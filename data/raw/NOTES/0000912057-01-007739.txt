REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
To
the Share Owners of
APAC Customer Services,Inc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of APAC CUSTOMER SERVICES,INC. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2000 and January2, 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, share owners' equity and cash flows for the years ended December31, 2000, January2, 2000 and January3, 1999. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of APAC Customer Services,Inc. and Subsidiaries as of

integration services to its array of customer care programs. To help its clients better manage relationships with their customers, APAC Customer Services develops and delivers

Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Results of operations of business combinations accounted for as a purchase have been included in the consolidated financial statements for all periods
subsequent to the dates of acquisition. 
Certain
reclassifications of prior years' amounts have been made to conform with the current year presentation. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Fiscal Year 
The Company operates on a 52-/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday closest to December31. Fiscal years for the
consolidated financial statements included herein ended on December31, 2000, 52 weeks, January2, 2000 52 weeks, and January3, 1999 53 weeks. Cash Equivalents 
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, short-term investments readily converted to cash. 
Trade Receivables 
Concentration of credit risk is limited to trade receivables and is subject to the financial conditions of certain major clients. The Company generally does not
require collateral or other security to support clients' receivables. The Company conducts periodic reviews of its clients' financial conditions and vendor payment practices to minimize collection
risks on trade receivables. 
Long-lived Assets 
Long-lived assets are comprised of property and equipment, capitalized software and intangible assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed
for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
33  of an asset may not be recoverable. For long lived assets held for use an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flows produced by an asset are less than the asset
carrying value. 
Property and Equipment.Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis, using
estimated useful lives of up to 15years for building and leasehold improvements, 3 to 7years for telecommunications equipment, and 3 to 7years for workstations and office
equipment. Total depreciation expense for property and equipment for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $23,231, $25,770 and $28,862 respectively. 
Capitalized Software.The Company capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and installation of computer software for internal
use. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to 5years. Amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
1998 was $3,408, $3,721 and $2,837 respectively. 
Intangible Assets.Goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of
benefit ranging from 4 to 21years. Total amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $4,185, $4,494 and $5,130, respectively. Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes customer services revenue as services are performed for its clients, generally based upon hours incurred and is in compliance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No101 Revenue Recognition. 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
For stock-based employee compensation plans, the Company has elected to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No compensation expense is recognized for stock options issued to employees when the option price equals or exceeds the fair market value of
the Company Common Shares at the date of grant. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company
provides pro forma disclosures of net income and net income per share as if the fair value based method had been used. Stock-based compensation expense for non-employees is recognized in
accordance with SFAS No123. 
Interest Rate Agreements 
The Company uses interest rate swaps and caps to effectively hedge interest rate exposures. Amounts due to or from interest rate swap counterparties are
recorded in interest expense in the period in which they accrue. The premiums paid to purchase interest rate caps, as well as any gains and losses on terminated interest rate swap and cap agreements,
are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt to which they are matched. 
Comprehensive Income 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No130 SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which established standards for reporting
of comprehensive income, was adopted by the Company in January1998. As of January2, 2000 and January3, 1999, the Company had no transactions separately identified as components
of other comprehensive income under SFAS No130. 
2.New Accounting Pronouncements  Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Number 133, Accounting for Derivative and Hedging Activities 
This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts,
collectively referred to as derivatives and for 
34  hedging activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. As a result
of SFAS No137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesDeferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No133, the Company will adopt this standard in the
first quarter of fiscal 2001. Management believes that the impact of SFAS No133 will not have a material effect on the Company financial condition or results of operations. 
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin: No101Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements: 
In December1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101 Revenue Recognition.
SAB No101 provides guidance on the measurement and timing of revenue recognition in financial statements of public companies. Changes in accounting policies to apply the guidance of SAB
No101 were required to be adopted by recording the cumulative effect of the change in the fiscal quarter ending March31, 2000. No such adjustment was required for the Company and the
adoption of this pronouncement did not effect the accounting policies or results of operations of the Company in fiscal 2000.

4.Acquisition of ITI Holdings,Inc. 
Acquisition 
On May20, 1998, the Company acquired through merger all of the common stock of ITI Holdings,Inc., the sole shareholder of ITI Marketing
Services,Inc. ITI, a leading teleservices provider based in Omaha, Nebraska. In exchange for all of the common stock of ITI, the Company paid $1492million, net of cash acquired.
The initial purchase price was funded with proceeds from a $150million Term Loan. ITI business consisted of telephone-based sales, marketing and customer management services to corporate
clients with high volumes of outgoing or incoming calls through a network of customer interaction centers. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities
and results of operations of ITI have been included in the Company consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. 
The
excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and additional liabilities recorded of $1367million was initially allocated to intangible
assets based upon their estimated fair values as determined by independent appraisal. Purchased intangibles consisted of assembled workforce of $36million, customer relationships of
$368million and goodwill of $963million. The intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 7 to 21years. In addition, ITI had
accumulated net operating loss carryforwards of $128million as of the date of acquisition, which were fully reserved through a valuation allowance. In fiscal 2000 all net operating loss
carryforwards were utilized see note7 Income Taxes. 
In
connection with the acquisition, the Company provided a total of $212million in estimated costs to close facilities, terminate unfavorable contracts, write-off uncollectible
trade receivables and reduce the workforce by 135 employees. The amounts provided included $65million for facilities, $97million for contracts, $24million for trade
receivables and $26million for employee severance. Of this reserve, $129million has been utilized or paid through December31, 2000 and $67million has been taken as a
reduction of goodwill. The remaining balance of acquisition related reserves was $16million and $32million as of December31, 2000, and January2, 2000, respectively.
To the extent that unused facilities covered by long-term leases were subleased and unfavorable contracts were renegotiated, a reduction in the acquisition-related reserves and goodwill
recorded as of the end of fiscal year 1998 was required during fiscal year 1999, as discussed below. The remaining reserve at December31, 2000 will be utilized primarily for the reduction of
lease obligations over the term of such leases. 
Valuation Adjustments 
During fiscal year 1999, the Company recorded a $78million reduction in goodwill related to the 1998 acquisition of ITI. The decrease in goodwill did
not affect the reported results of operations. The Company reduced liabilities relating to the ITI purchase by $61million due to a reduction in the estimated costs to close facilities and
renegotiate contracts, and the Company revalued and increased certain deferred income tax assets by $17million. In fiscal year 2000 the final accounting related to the acquisition was
completed and excess reserves of $06million were taken as a reduction to goodwill. 
Nonrecurring Charges 
During fiscal year 1998, the Company recorded two nonrecurring charges in cost of services in connection with the ITI purchase. The Company provided allowances
for doubtful accounts of $25million to fully reserve trade accounts receivable balances due from two ITI clients who had filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy law. The Company also
accrued a total of $71million in future telecommunications costs guaranteed under two minimum usage contracts scheduled to expire in the year 2000. As a result of the downturn in ITI 
36  business, the Company had not expected to achieve the minimum volumes under these contracts and, accordingly, did not expect to recover the guaranteed costs from future results of operations. 
During
fiscal year 2000 and 1999, results of operations were favorably affected by the reversal of $14million and $49million, respectively, of telecommunications charges that had
been accrued in fiscal 1998. These reversals, which were reflected in cost of services, were realized when the Company was able to negotiate the favorable dispositions of costs associated with
guaranteed minimum usage telecommunications contracts. 
Asset Impairment 
During fiscal year 1998, fourth quarter reductions in clients' use of outbound telemarketing programs as a method of customer acquisition had reduced ITI
Customer Acquisition division net revenue and profitability substantially below levels that existed at the date of acquisition. Six clients, comprising approximately 65% of ITI Customer Acquisition
net revenue, had either ceased or substantially reduced their telemarketing activities due to apparent financial impairment or consolidation in the consumer and financial services industries. In
addition, lower than expected outbound telemarketing volume had prevented the Company from realizing synergies anticipated with and valued in the ITI acquisition. 
These
events required the Company to evaluate the recoverability of the long-lived assets of the Customer Acquisition division of ITI in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998. As a result
of the loss of ITI client base, estimated future undiscounted cash flows from ITI Customer Acquisition business were less than the carrying value of its long-lived assets. Accordingly,
the Company adjusted the carrying value of the Customer Acquisition division long-lived assets to their fair value of $136million resulting in an impairment loss of
$697million $659million, or $136 per share, net of income tax benefit. The impairment loss was comprised of a write-off of property and equipment of
$19million, customer relationships of $83million and goodwill of $595million. The fair market valuation was based upon the appraised value of the remaining customer base of
the Customer Acquisition division as determined from projections of discounted future cash flows. The remainder of ITI business had not been impaired. 
Pro Forma Information 
The unaudited pro forma results of operations, as if the ITI acquisition had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1998 are summarized below in thousands, except
per share data: 1998 Net revenue 487,527 Income loss from continuing operations
68,162 Net loss
79,190 Income loss per diluted share from continuing operations 140 Net loss per diluted share 163 The
pro forma results include adjustments for unfavorable telephone contracts, goodwill and intangible asset amortization, interest expense and income taxes. The pro forma results of operations do not
necessarily represent operating results which would have occurred if the acquisition had taken place on the basis assumed above, nor are they indicative of future operating results of the combined
companies. 
5.Discontinued Operations  On August19, 1997, the Company acquired all of the common and preferred stock of Paragren Technologies,Inc. Paragren, a 
37  specialist in software-based marketing products that help its clients analyze market, customer and sales data on a real-time basis. In addition to its software solutions, systems
integration and consulting services, Paragren designs, develops and manages consumer-panel research. 
In
consideration for the common and preferred stock of Paragren, the Company issued to Paragren share owners 1,991,385 shares of its Common Shares and converted existing Paragren stock options into
stock options for an additional 189,199 shares of the Company Common Shares. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price of approximately $329million was allocated
to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values as determined by an independent appraisal. The allocation of values to intangible assets consisted of
$15million to assembled workforce and non-compete covenants, $198million to in-process research and development, and $120million to goodwill. 
In
December1998, the Company management approved a plan to sell Paragren when it decided that additional investment in the software development business was not consistent with the Company
long-term strategic goals and objectives. Accordingly, Paragren was reported as a discontinued operation, and the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 1998 were reclassified
to segregate the operating results and net assets of the business. At that time, the Company fully expected to sell Paragren during fiscal year 1999. During fiscal year 1998, the estimated net loss
relating to the disposal of Paragren was $84million, net of an income tax benefit of $11million. The estimate included a reduction in asset values of $65million for the
expected loss on disposal based upon a preliminary offer for the business which the Company had received. The estimate also included a provision for anticipated net operating losses until disposal of
$19million, net of an income tax benefit of $11million. 
In
January2000, pursuant to an agreement executed in December1999, the Company sold the stock of Paragren Technologies,Inc. representing substantially all of the assets of
Paragren and received $17million in cash proceeds. After selling expenses and other costs, $11million of the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan in
accordance with the financial covenants concerning the sale of assets. In January2001, the Company received an additional $28million of proceeds related to the terms of escrow and
earn-out agreements. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a net gain on the sale of Paragren of $05million, net of $03million of income tax expenses in fiscal
2000. 
The
operations and anticipated disposal of Paragren did not affect the Company results of operations in 1999 as the loss provision established in fiscal 1998, was sufficient to absorb these losses.
The proceeds from the sale of Paragren exceeded the amount estimated in 1998, and, accordingly, asset values were increased by $36million. However, actual losses from operations for Paragren
in fiscal 1999 were $36million greater than the amount estimated in 1998 and offset the increase in the estimated proceeds. As a result, there was no income statement impact to the Company in
1999. Due to the sale of Paragren in January2000 there were no operating results for fiscal 2000.

the purchase of ITI. For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance in the amount of approximately $45million was recorded in 1998 as an offset to the deferred tax assets of ITI that
could only be realized to the extent that ITI generates sufficient future book and taxable income. In fiscal 2000 the Company generated taxable income sufficient to utilize all $177million of
these net operating loss carryforwards including the $128million of such carryforwards fully reserved in previous years.

May20, 1998, the Company entered into a $250million Senior Credit Facility Credit Facility with a group of lending institutions and at the same time repaid all amounts
outstanding on its prior $80million credit facility. The Credit Facility consisted of a $150million Term Loan and a $100million Revolving Facility. Borrowings under the
Revolving Facility would be used to provide working capital and fund capital expenditures. Proceeds from the Term Loan were used to acquire the common stock of ITI Holdings,Inc. The common
stock of ITI and all existing or acquired subsidiaries serve as collateral under the terms of the Credit Facility. 
On
September8, 1998, the Credit Facility was amended and restated, reducing the available borrowings to $225million consisting of a $150million Term Loan and a
$75million Revolving Facility. Subsequently, there have been four amendments to the September8, 1998 amended and restated Credit Facility. Most recently, the Fourth Amendment was
adopted on January20, 2000. 
Under
the terms of the Credit Facility as amended and in effect at the end of fiscal 2000 the total facility is $169million, consisting of a $119million Term Loan and a
$50million Revolving Facility. The Company is required to make quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan, ranging from $4million to $7million per quarter, with a specified
final payment of $50million due June1, 2003. At December31, 2000, the Company had $103million outstanding under 
42  the Term Loan and zero outstanding on the Revolving Facility. 
Under
the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants which limit the Company ability to incur additional indebtedness, repurchase outstanding
common shares, create liens, acquire, sell or dispose of certain assets, engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, and to make certain restricted payments. As a result, the Company is not allowed to
pay dividends on its Common Shares. The Company is in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by the terms of the Credit Facility as of December31, 2000. 
Borrowings
under the Credit Facility incur a floating interest rate usually based on the LIBOR index rate, although the Company has the option of using an alternate base rate defined in the agreement.
In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility as well as an annual fee on the outstanding letters of credit. As of December31, 2000, the
Company had $41million of outstanding letters of credit. 
In
connection with securing the Credit Facility in 1998, the Company paid fees and expenses of $20million. The debt issuance costs are recorded as deferred charges and are being amortized
over the term of the Credit Facility of five years. The amortization of deferred debt costs for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $04million, $04million and $02million,
respectively. 
Interest Rate Agreements 
The Company has entered into various interest rate agreements with one of the parties to the Credit Facility. On May20, 1998, the Company entered into
an interest rate swap agreement Swap and an interest rate cap agreement Cap to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its floating rate debt. Under the terms of the Swap,
through June1, 2003, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 60% and receives a floating rate payment based on the 30-day LIBOR rate. The Swap had an initial notional amount of
$100million and amortizes, pro rata, with principal payments on the Term Loan. The notional amount on the Swap was reduced by $11million, by way of sale in the open market, to reflect
the $11million prepayment on the
Term Loan on January18, 2000. Under the terms of the Cap, through June1, 2003, the Company will make payments based on 45% of the outstanding notional amount of the Term Loan, and the
Company will receive payments any time the 30-day LIBOR rate exceeds 60%. The Cap had an initial notional amount of $50million and amortizes, pro rata, with principal payments on
the Term Loan. At December31, 2000, the fair market values of the Swap and Cap were $247and $214, respectively. 
9. Commitments and Contingencies 
Lease Commitments 
The Company leases its Customer Interaction Centers and administrative offices. Rent expense for the fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998 was $8,944, $7,548 and

The Company, certain of its officers and directors and the lead underwriters of certain public offerings of the Company securities have been named as
defendants in three purported class action lawsuits instituted by various persons who purchased the Company Common Shares in such offerings. The suits were filed in federal district court for the
Southern District of New York on December11, 1997, December19, 1997 and January5, 1998, respectively. The lawsuits were consolidated in April1998 into one lawsuit. The
lawsuit alleges violations of the federal securities laws in connection with the Company November1996 Prospectus and other public statements which are alleged to have omitted certain
disclosures with respect to the Company agreement with a large parcel delivery client. The complaint as amended seeks, among other things, unspecified damages and an award of attorney fees, costs
and expenses. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on September10, 1998. On or about November15, 1999, the court denied the motion to dismiss. Discovery is proceeding in
this action. The Company denies all allegations of wrongdoing and continues to believe that it has meritorious defenses. 
On
January5, 2000, APAC,Inc. filed suit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia Atlanta Division alleging that the Company use of APAC
in the Company name infringes a trademark of APAC,Inc. The suit asserts violations of the federal Lanham Act and various Georgia state statutes, as well as a breach by the Company of an
agreement between APAC,Inc. and the Company. Discovery is proceeding in this action and the Company continues to defend itself vigorously. 
Additionally,
the Company is subject to occasional lawsuits, governmental investigations and claims arising out of the normal conduct of business. Management does not believe the outcome of any
pending claims will have a materially adverse impact on the Company consolidated financial position. 
Although
the Company does not believe that any of these proceedings will result in a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, no assurance to that effect can be given. Training Bonds 
At the end of the 2000, 1999 and 1998 fiscal years, the Company had guaranteed the repayment of approximately $625, $887 and $1,435 respectively, of the
remaining outstanding community college bond obligations, which were issued in connection with various job-training agreements. At December31, 2000, the Company estimates that the
deposits made into escrow will be adequate to cover the cost of the maturing bonds.

10.Share Owners' Equity 
The authorized capital stock of APAC Customer Services,Inc. consists of a200million Common Shares, $01 par value per share, of which
49,520,906 were issued as of December31, 2000, and b50million Preferred Shares, $01 par value per share, of which no shares have been issued. On August31, 1998, the
Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase, from time to time at management discretion, up to 2,500,000 shares of its outstanding Common Shares at market prices. During fiscal 1998, the
Company repurchased 1,609,000 shares at an average price of $350
per share. The remaining authorization has expired. In fiscal 2000 742,296 of the treasury shares previously purchased were sold, primarily to a member of the Board of Directors. 
11.Equity Instruments 
Stock Options 
The Company has granted options to purchase Common Shares under three plans all established in 1995. Under the Executive Plan, on May26, 1995, the
Company granted an officer options to purchase 565,034 Common Shares at an aggregate price of $1,765 or an average exercise price of $312 per share. The options, now fully vested, have a term of
10years. The weighted average fair value of the options at the date of grant were $183 per share, based upon the assumptions described below using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 
Under
the Incentive Stock Option Plan, which is the result of a merger of the Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan, directors, officers, key
employees and non-employee consultants may be granted nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and stock awards, all as determined
by a committee of the Board of Directors or by the full board in the case of non-employee Directors. A total of 118million shares have been authorized for grant under the
Incentive Stock Option Plan with 25million shares of this amount still subject to shareholder approval. The exercise price of incentive stock options granted may not be less than 100% of the
fair market value of the Common Shares at the date of grant. The exercise price of non-qualified stock options granted may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of the Common
Shares at the date of grant. 
Non-employee
Directors receive annual grants of 20,000 non-qualified stock options. In addition, the Company provides attendance grants for the non-affiliated
directors. For each meeting, 1,000 options are awarded for attendance and 500 options are awarded for participation by telephone. The exercise price of the directors' options granted is equal to the
fair market value of the Common Shares at the date of grant. 
Options
under both the Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan expire at periods between 5 and 15years after date of grant.

August5, 1998 the Company Board of Directors authorized repricing of certain of its outstanding stock options having an exercise price in excess of the then current market value.
The actions were taken on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, in order to preserve an economic incentive for continued commitment to the Company success. On that date, all options held
by employees, other than those held by the Company then Chief Executive Officer, President and certain other members of senior management, with an exercise price in excess of $650 per share, when
the then current market value was $538 per share, were repriced to have an exercise price of $650 per share. Employees at the senior vice president level had their options repriced to $850 per
share. After repricing, 4,264,843 options were priced between $097 and $850 per share. Options for 558,624 shares, which were not repriced on August5, 1998 ranged in price from $950 to
$3813 per share. 
The
Company applies APB No25 in accounting for the stock option plans above. No compensation expense has been recognized for stock options when the option price equals or exceeds the fair
market value 
46  at date of grant. In order to calculate the pro forma information below, the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions
include no dividend yield, risk-free interest rates ranging from 5% to 7%, expected volatility ranging between 70% and 90%, and an expected life ranging from 7years to
10years. Pro forma results of operations for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 which reflect the adjustment to compensation expense to account for stock options in accordance with SFAS
No123 are as follows: 2000 
1999

12,320 Pro forma net income loss 13,326 461 91,640 Pro forma net income loss per diluted share 026 001 189 The
pro forma disclosure is not likely to be indicative of pro forma results of operations which may be expected in future years because of the fact that options vest over several years, compensation
expense is recognized as the options vest and additional awards may also be granted. 
Stock Purchase Warrants 
In March 1998, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with a client and issued 75,000 stock purchase warrants at an exercise price of $1425 per share in
exchange for services to be performed. Each warrant represents the right to purchase one share of the Company Common Shares at the exercise price. Warrants representing 35,000 shares vested in
fiscal year 1998 with the balance vesting over the next four years. The warrants became exercisable on March10, 1998, and expire on March9, 2007. The estimated fair value of the
warrants on the date issued was $714 per share using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and assumptions similar to those used for valuing the Company stock options described above. The Company
recorded $82, $153 and $250 in selling expense in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, for warrants that vested during the year. 
12.Benefit Plans 
In October1995, the Company adopted a 401k savings plan. Employees, meeting certain eligibility requirements as defined, may contribute up to 15% of
pretax gross wages, subject to certain restrictions. The Company makes matching contributions of 25% of the first 6% of employee wages contributed to the plan. Company matching contributions vest 20%
per year over a five-year period. For fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company made matching contributions to the plan of $411, $365 and $270, respectively. 
In
fiscal year 1996, share owners of the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan. The plan is administered by the compensation committee and permits eligible employees to purchase an aggregate
of 600,000 Common Shares at 85% of the lesser of the current market closing price of the Company Common Shares at the beginning or end of a quarter. Employees may annually purchase Common Shares up
to the lesser of 15% of their gross wages or $2500. During the fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, 70,315, 92,326, and 57,669 Common Shares, respectively, were issued to employees under this plan. 
47  13.Segment Information 
In fiscal 2000, the Company has three reportable segments organized around divisions providing separate and distinct services to clients. The operating
divisions are managed separately because the service offerings require different technology and marketing strategies and have different operating models and performance metrics. The Customer Care
business unit provides inbound customer service, direct mail response, help line support and customer order processing. The Customer Acquisition business unit provides outbound sales support to
customers and businesses, market research, targeted marketing plan development and customer lead generation, acquisition and retention. CustomerAssistance.com provides Web-based customer
relationship management products and services for Fortune 1000 and dot.com companies. 
Through
fiscal year 1999, the Company had three reportable segments organized around operating divisions providing separate and distinct services to clients. The operating divisions were managed
separately because the service offerings require different technology and marketing strategies and have different operating models and performance metrics. 
The
Software Development division was managed by the Company wholly-owned subsidiary, Paragren Technologies,Inc. Paragren, which specialized in software-based consumer marketing products
to help clients analyze market, customer and sales data on a real-time basis. In December1998 the Company adopted a plan to sell Paragren. Accordingly, the operating results of
Paragren were segregated from continuing operations and are reported separately as discontinued operations. In January2000 Paragren was sold, see note6 for details. 
All
operating net revenue and expenses are included in the results of the business segments. Shared Services expenses which include information technology costs and corporate selling, general and
administrative expenses are allocated to the business segments primarily based upon telephone hours, consistent with management financial expectations for the business segments. Other income and
expense, principally interest expense and gain and loss on the disposal of assets, are excluded from the determination of business segment results. Shared Services assets that include investments in
information technology and corporate assets are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate assets include cash and cash equivalents, tax assets, property and equipment associated with
information technology and selling, general and administrative functions, and certain prepaid expenses and deferred charges related to risk management and
corporate financing activities. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no intersegment sales or
transfers. The Company evaluates performance based on operating earnings of the respective operating divisions. 
The
nature of the industry is such that the Company receives a significant portion of its annual net revenue from several large clients. The Company largest client, a parcel delivery company
provided 15%, 14% and 16% of annual net revenue for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, all of which was in the Customer Care division. In addition, a telecommunications company provided
10% of total annual net revenue in 1999, of which over 90% was in the Customer Care division. Another telecommunications client provided 13% of total net revenue in 1998 of which over 70% was in the
Customer Acquisition division. There were no other clients that provided greater than 10% of total revenue in 2000. 48  Segment information for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 is as follows in thousands: Fiscal Years Ended
