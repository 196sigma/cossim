41 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of VNUS Medical
Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of VNUS Medical Technologies,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and 2007,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under a2 presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for these financial statements and financial statement schedule,
for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on these financial statements, on the financial statement
schedule and on the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
Note1
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.   Principles of consolidation and basis of
presentation.The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of VNUS Medical Technologies,
Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.   Foreign Currency Translation.We transact
business in various foreign currencies. In general, the
functional currency of a foreign operation is the local
countrys currency except for our German subsidiary, whose
functional currency is the United States dollar. Non-functional
currency monetary balances are re-measured into the functional
currency of the subsidiary with any related gain or loss
recorded in other income, net, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations. Assets and liabilities of operations
outside the United States, for which the functional currency is
the local currency, are translated into United States dollars
using fiscal year-end exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each
fiscal month during the year. The effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments are included in stockholders
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Foreign
currency gains or losses included in other income, net, in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations were a loss
of $580,000 in 2008, and gains of $376,000 and $208,000 in 2007
and 2006, respectively.   Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.   Reclassifications.Certain balance sheet
amounts in the 2007 and 2006 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 2008 presentation.   Cash and Cash Equivalents.The Company
considers all highly-liquid investment instruments with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. As of December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the
Company held its cash and cash equivalents in checking accounts,
money market accounts and investment accounts with several
financial institutions. Some accounts exceeded FDIC insurance
limits. Certain accounts were held with financial institutions
outside the United States of America in Western European
countries.   Short-term and Long-term
Investments.Short-term and long-term
investments, which include money market instruments, debt
instruments of the United States government and its agencies and
high-quality corporate issuers, are reported at fair value using
the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses
are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of other
comprehensive income loss. Additionally, the Company assesses
whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on its
investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other
market conditions. The Company has not identified any such
impairment losses to date.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments.The
Companys financial instruments, including cash, cash
equivalents not accounted for under SFAS No. 157, prepaid
expenses and other current assets, accrued liabilities and
accounts payable are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value because of the nature of those instruments. Cash
equivalents not carried at cost and short-term and long-term
investments are carried at fair value see Note5.   Inventories.Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market, cost being determined using the
first-in,
first-out method. Lower of cost or market is evaluated by
considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory,
deterioration and other factors.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Shipping and Handling Costs.In accordance
with the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issue
00-10,
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, the
Company includes shipping and handling revenues in net sales and
shipping and handling costs in cost of goods sold.   Property and Equipment.Property and equipment
are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, or the lease term of the respective assets, if
applicable. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the asset or the term of the lease.   The depreciation and amortization period for property and
equipment categories are as follows   	
Furniture and fixtures   3years   Computer and office equipment   3years   Laboratory equipment   5years   Software   3 to 5years   Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Repairs and
maintenance are charged to operations as incurred.   Revenue Recognition.The Company sells its
disposable catheters and radio frequency, or RF, generators, to
end-users in the United States and in international markets.
Catheters and RF generators are also sold through distributors
in certain international markets. The Company also sells RF
generators to third-party leasing companies in the United
States. These third-party leasing companies provide long-term
lease financing to end-users. The Company does not provide such
long-term lease financing to end-users. The Company also
licenses its proprietary technology to third parties in exchange
for royalties.   The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with
SABNo104, Revenue Recognition
SAB104, when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, title has transferred, the sellers
price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
assured. For an arrangement with multiple deliverables, the
Company recognizes product sales in accordance with EITF
No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, with
revenues allocated among the different elements, and in
accordance with EITF
No03-05,
Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position
97-2 to
Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing
More-Than-Incidental Software.   For product revenues, we generally use contracts and customer
purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. We
use shipping documents and third-party proof of delivery to
verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the terms of the agreement associated with
the transaction. In order to determine whether collection is
reasonably assured, we assess a number of factors, including
past transaction history with the customer and the
credit-worthiness of the customer. If we determine that
collection is not reasonably assured, we defer the recognition
of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is
generally upon receipt of payment.   The Companys domestic sales return policy allows customers
to return unused products for a period within 30days
subject to restocking fees. The Companys international
sales return policy allows customers to return unused products
for a period within 60days subject to restocking fees. The
Company makes provisions for estimated returns and allowances
based on historical levels. To date, returns and allowances have
not been significant.   For royalty revenue, we use negotiated royalty licensing
agreements to determine the existence of an arrangement and
transfer of title. Royalty licensing agreements typically cover
products shipped by the licensee after the date that the license
agreement has been entered into and until the patent has expired
or when the agreement expires, whichever is shorter. The
Companys royalties are computed per unit shipped, are paid
quarterly in arrears and recognized as revenue at the time the
amount of the quarterly royalty payment becomes determinable and
collection is reasonably assured.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Deferred revenue, net.Deferred revenue, net,
consists of ideferred revenue on sales related to
distributors pending sell-through information or sales where
collectability was not reasonably assured at the time of
shipment, offset by deferred cost of revenue, and
iideferred warranty and training revenue.   Warranty.The Company generally provides a one
year limited warranty on its RF generator which is included in
the sales price of the generator. The Company provides for the
estimated future costs of repair, upgrade or replacement upon
shipment of the product. The warranty accrual is based upon
historical trends in the volume of product returns within the
warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment.
In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals are
made for specific technical problems.   Research and Development Costs.Costs related
to research, design and development of products are charged to
research and development expense as incurred.   Advertising Expenses.Advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses incurred in the years
ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $558,000,
$664,000, and $262,000 respectively.   Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting
Principle.Upon the adoption of
SFASNo123R on January1, 2006, the Company
elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method of
SFASNo123R, except for those options that were
measured using the minimum value method under
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, for which the Company applied the prospective
transition method. The impact of the adoption has resulted in an
adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.   Accordingly, during the year ended December31, 2006, the
Company recorded stock-based compensation cost totaling the
amount that would have been recognized had the fair value method
been applied since the effective date of SFASNo123.
Previously reported amounts have not been restated. The
cumulative effect, through December31, 2005, was a
decrease in share-based compensation expense and a corresponding
increase to equity of $73,000 to reflect the application of the
estimated forfeiture rates to deferred share-based compensation
related to the intrinsic value of restricted stock units granted
in 2005.   Comprehensive Income Loss.Comprehensive
income loss is defined as the change in equity of a company
during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances, excluding transactions resulting from investments
by owners and distributions to owners, and is to include
unrealized gains and losses that have historically been excluded
from net income and loss and reflected instead in equity.
Unrealized gains and losses on short-term and long-term
investments and foreign currency translation gains and losses
are recorded in other comprehensive income loss as a component
of equity.   Income Taxes.The Company accounts for income
taxes under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or
liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet
date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, FASB issued SFASNo157, Fair
Value Measurements SFAS157.
SFAS157 defines fair value, establishes a framework and
gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair
value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFAS157 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. FASB Staff Position
FSP
FAS157-2
Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP
FAS157-2,
delayed the effective date for all nonfinancial assets and
liabilities until January1, 2009, except those that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS157
on January1, 2008 did not have a material effect on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. See
Note5 for further discussion and disclosure.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159, The
Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No115 SFAS159, which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. This
statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified
election dates. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items
for which the fair value option has been elected will be
reported in earnings. The adoption of SFAS159 did not have
a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial
statements.   In March 2008, the FASB issued SFASNo161,
Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities SFAS161, which is intended to
improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and
hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable
investors to better understand their effects on an entitys
financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
SFAS161 is effective for the Company in the second quarter
of fiscal year 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS161 to have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   In May 2008, the FASB issued SFASNo162, The
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
SFAS162, which identifies the sources of
accounting principles and the framework for selecting the
principles used in the preparation of financial statements of
nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
SFAS162 will become effective 60days following the
SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board amendments to AU Section411, The Meaning of
Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS162 to have a material effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB

Net
Income Loss Per Share   The Company computes basic net income loss per share by
dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Basic net income loss per share excludes the
dilutive effect of potential stock including stock options and
restricted stock unitsRSUs. Diluted income
per share reflects the dilution of potential common shares
outstanding during the period. In computing diluted income per
share, the Company adjusts share count by assuming that all
in-the-money options are exercised and that the Company
repurchases shares with the proceeds of these hypothetical
exercises. The Company further assumes that any unamortized
deferred stock-based compensation for in-the-money options and
RSUs is also used to repurchase shares. In determining the
hypothetical shares repurchased, the Company uses the average
stock price for the period.

Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash
equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and accounts
receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand
and money market accounts in several financial institutions in
the United States and internationally. Deposits held with
financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance
provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any
material losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to short-term and
long-term investments are limited due to the Companys cash
investment policies which limit cash investments to low-risk
investments and limit concentration of investments with any one
issuer. Short-term and long-term investments include money
market instruments, certificates of deposits, debt instruments
of the United States government and its agencies and
high-quality corporate issuers, all with maturity dates less
than three years.   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are limited due to the large number of customers
comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion
across many geographies. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral from its customers. The Company maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected
collectability of all accounts receivable. No single customer
represents more than 10% of the accounts receivable amount or
revenues for any period presented.

Fair
Value Measurements   On January1, 2008, the Company adopted the methods of fair
value described in SFAS157 to value its financial assets
and liabilities. As defined in SFAS157, fair value is the
price that would be received for asset when sold or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date exit price.   The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring
fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best
information available to it. Accordingly, the Company utilizes
valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible, and considers the security issuers and the
third-party insurers credit risk in its assessment of fair
value.   SFAS157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1
measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
Level3 measurement. The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy defined by SFAS157 are as follows   Level1:Quoted prices are available in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions
for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and
volume to provide the most reliable pricing information and
evidence of fair value on an ongoing basis.   Level2:Pricing inputs are other than quoted
prices in active markets included in Level1, which are
either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
date. Level2 includes those financial instruments that are
valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These
models are primarily industry-standard models that consider
various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for
commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market
and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well
as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these
assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the
full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data
or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are
executed in the marketplace.   Level3:Pricing inputs include significant
inputs that are generally less observable from objective
sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed
methodologies that result in managements best estimate of
fair value from the perspective of a market participant.
Instruments subject to Level3 measurements include those
that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to
customers needs. At each balance sheet date, the Company
performs an analysis of all instruments subject to
SFASNo157 and includes in Level3 all of those
whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs.
The market approach uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or
comparable assets.

STATEMENTSContinued   The Companys cash equivalents and marketable investments
are classified within Level1 or Level2 of the fair

Commitments
and Contingencies   Product Warranty Commitment.The Company
generally provides a one year limited warranty on its RF
generator which is included in the sales price of the generator.
The Company provides for the estimated future costs of repair,
upgrade or replacement upon shipment of the product. The
warranty reserve is based upon historical trends in the volume
of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to
repair or replace the equipment. In addition, from time to time,
specific warranty accruals are made for specific technical
problems including software bugs, component or other
manufacturing defects. Costs are estimated and accrued for
specific warranty issues in the period in which the warranty
issue becomes known to management and the costs are reasonably
estimable. The increase in the warranty reserve during the year
ended December31, 2006 was for the estimated costs of a

a patent infringement lawsuit the 2005 Patent
Lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California against Diomed, AngioDynamics
and Vascular Solutions, for infringement of certain United
States Patents owned by the Company. The 2005 Patent Lawsuit is
entitled VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc.v. Diomed
Holdings, Inc., et al., N.D. Cal. Case
No.C05-02972MMC.
The defendants market endovenous laser ablation products for use
in methods which the Company believes are covered by several of
its patents. On March14, 2008, Diomed filed a petition for
Chapter11 Bankruptcy protection in the United States
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. As a
result, an automatic stay was imposed on the 2005 Patent Lawsuit
with respect to Diomed only.   In June 2008, the Company settled and resolved the 2005 Patent
Lawsuit against AngioDynamics and Vascular Solutions by entering
into a Settlement Agreement the Agreement with
those two defendants. The Agreement results in the Company
granting to AngioDynamics and Vascular Solutions a
non-exclusive, non-sublicensable patent license that covers
certain products such as disposable endovenous laser fiber kits,
laser fibers, and lasers used in the field of endovenous laser
ablation. As part of the Agreement, AngioDynamics and Vascular
Solutions stipulated that the Companys
patents-in-suit
are valid, enforceable, and were infringed by the licensees.   As a result of the Diomed bankruptcy and the Settlement
Agreement, the 2005 Patent Lawsuit remained pending, but stayed,
against Diomed only. In June 2008, most of the assets of Diomed
were acquired by AngioDynamics. On or about June20, 2008,
the Company filed claims against the Diomed bankruptcy estate
for monetary damages attributable to Diomeds alleged
patent infringement, both prior to and since its bankruptcy
petition date. The Companys claims comprised an
administrative expense claim of $26million and a general
unsecured claim of $407million.   In September 2008, the Massachusetts bankruptcy court approved a
stipulation entered into by the Company and Diomed, under which
the two parties settled the Companys claims against the
Diomed bankruptcy estate. The stipulation provided for
settlement of the Companys administrative expense claim
for $300,000 and the Companys general unsecured claim for
$3,000,000. In September 2008, the Company received a payment of
$300,000 from Diomed for the settled administrative expense
claim. Due to the nature of bankruptcy proceedings the Company
cannot presently estimate how much, if any, of the $3,000,000
settled general unsecured claim will eventually be paid to the
Company. As such, no amount related to the potential gain, if
any, from this claim has been recorded in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.   In June 2008, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit
the First 2008 Patent Lawsuit in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California against
biolitec Inc. Biolitec, Dornier MedTech America,
Inc. Dornier and NewStar Lasers, Inc. d/b/a

Lawsuit is entitled VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc.v.
Biolitec, Inc. et al., N.D. Cal. Case
No.C08-03129MMC.
Biolitec, CoolTouch and Dornier market endovenous laser ablation
products for use in procedures which VNUS believes infringe
several of its patents. VNUS is seeking an injunction
prohibiting these companies from selling these products, in
addition to monetary damages.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   In September and November 2008, the defendants filed answers to
the First 2008 Patent Lawsuit in which the defendants deny that
they infringe, allege that the asserted patents are invalid and
unenforceable, and assert counterclaims seeking declarations
that the patents are not infringed, invalid and unenforceable.   In September 2008, the Company filed a patent infringement
lawsuit the Second 2008 Patent Lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California against Total Vein Solutions LLC d/b/a Total Vein
Systems TVS. The Second 2008 Patent Lawsuit is
entitled VNUS Medical Technologies, Inc.v. Total Vein
Solutions, LLC d/b/a Total Vein Systems, N.D. Cal. Case
No.C08-04234MMC.
In the Second 2008 Patent Lawsuit the Company has sued TVS for
infringement of the same patents as have been asserted in the
First 2008 Patent Lawsuit.   In December 2008 and January 2009, TVS filed answers to the
Second 2008 Patent Lawsuit. In its answers TVS denies that it
infringes, alleges that the asserted patents are invalid and
unenforceable, and asserts counterclaims seeking declarations
that the patents are not infringed, invalid and unenforceable.
TVS also asserted antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims
against the Company relating to the Companys enforcement
of its patents against TVS. In January 2009 TVS and the Company
agreed to bifurcate and stay TVSs antitrust and unfair
competition counterclaims pending resolution of the threshold
issue of patent enforceability.   In November 2008, the Court consolidated the First and Second
2008 Patent Lawsuits. As a result, the two lawsuits will be
effectively treated as one proceeding by the Court for the
remainder of their pendency. As of December31, 2008, both
the First and Second 2008 Patent Lawsuits remained pending.   If any of the defendants in the 2008 Patent Lawsuits succeeds in
obtaining a declaration or order from the Court that one or more
of the patents asserted in the Lawsuits or one or more of the
claims of such patents is invalid, not infringed, or
significantly narrowed in scope, or that one or more of the
patents asserted in the Lawsuits is unenforceable, such a result
could adversely affect the strength of the Companys patent
portfolio and the Companys ability to exclude competitors
from the endovenous ablation market. In addition, under some
circumstances such a result, if sustained on appeal, could
affect the Companys ability to recover future royalties
due under the June 2008 Settlement Agreement.   Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of litigation, the
Company cannot provide any assurances regarding the eventual
outcome of the 2008 Patent Lawsuits.   The Company is also involved in other legal proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of business. While there can be no
assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation
involving the Company, management does not believe any such
other pending legal proceeding will result in a judgment or
settlement that would have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   Leases.The Company leases office space and
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various
expiration dates through 2014. Rent expense for the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $12million,
$12million, and $14million, respectively. The
Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease period, and has accrued for rent expense incurred but
not paid.

contract, less the portion that would still be used by the
Company for storage for the remainder of the lease period. The
Company did not offset these lease payments by estimated
sublease rental income. Management concluded that subleasing the
Zanker facility was not probable.   Purchase Commitments.At December31,
2008, the Company had approximately $46million in
purchase commitments for the next twelve months with suppliers,
of which $38million was inventory related.   The Company relies on Byers Peak, Inc. to manufacture its RF
generators. The initial term of the supply agreement with Byers
Peak expired in February 2007, however, the contract continues
indefinitely until terminated by either party upon
180days notice. The Company expects that Byers Peak,
Inc. will be a sole-source supplier of the RF generators for the
foreseeable future. The Company also relies on sole-source
suppliers to manufacture some of the components used in its
disposable catheters. The Companys manufacturers and
suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a
variety of reasons, including failure to follow specific

or impede its ability to meet demand.   Indemnifications.In the normal course of
business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and provide for
general indemnifications. The Companys exposure under
these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may
be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been
made. To date, the Company has not paid any claims or been
required to defend any action related to its indemnification
obligations, and accordingly, the Company has not accrued any
amounts for such indemnification obligations. However, the
Company may record charges in the future as a result of these
indemnification obligations.

Share-Based
Compensation   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS123R which establishes accounting for
share-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly,
share-based compensation expense is measured at grant date,
based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as
expense over the employees requisite service period. The
Company has no awards with market conditions. The Company
previously applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion 25,
Accounting for Shares Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations and provided the required pro-forma disclosures
of SFAS123.   The Company awards a limited number of stock options and
restricted stock units to non-employees. Non-cash share-based
expense from instruments issued to non-employees is accounted
for in accordance with the provisions of
EITF96-18,
Accounting for Equity Investments that are Issued to
Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling,
Goods or Services In 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company
recorded non-employee share-based compensation expense of
$83,000, $0, and $10,000, respectively.   Impact
of the adoption of SFASNo123R   The Company elected to adopt the modified prospective
application method as provided by SFAS123R, except for
those options that were measured using the minimum value method
under SFAS123, for which the Company has adopted the
prospective transition method. Under the modified prospective
application, prior periods are not revised for comparative
purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS123R apply to
new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective
date and subsequently modified or cancelled. Estimated
compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for awards
outstanding at the effective date will be recognized over the
remaining service period.   On November10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FASNo123R-C,
Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of
Share-Based Payment Awards. The Company has elected to adopt
the alternative transition method provided in this FASB Staff
Position for calculating the tax effects of share-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS123R. The alternative
transition method includes a simplified method to establish the
beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool APIC
pool related to the tax effects of employee share-based
compensation, which is available to absorb tax deficiencies
recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS123R.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
recorded a cumulative adjustment for share-based compensation
costs to expense the amount that would have been recognized had
the fair value method been applied since the effective date of
SFAS123, to adjust for application of a forfeiture rate to
restricted stock unit awards granted during 2005. The previously

variables.   The weighted average estimated fair value of options granted
during the twelve month periods ended December31, 2008,
2007 and, 2006, were calculated under the Black-Scholes model,
using the following weighted-average assumptions   	
Years Ended December31   2008   2007   2006   Risk free interest rates   173%-302   352%-484   455%-500   Expected life in years   485-56   485-525   525-625   Dividend yield          Volatility   767%-790   797%-869   638%-962   The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, consistent with
the provisions of SFAS123R, SAB107 and the
Companys prior period pro forma disclosures of net
earnings, including share-based compensation. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of short-lived exchange traded options that have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the options expected life and the
price volatility of the underlying stock. In connection with the
adoption of SFAS123R, the Company reassessed its valuation
technique and related assumptions.   Expected volatility was determined using the historical
volatility of the Companys common stock and the historical
volatility of a number of peer companies to approximate expected
volatility over the expected term of the options.   The Company determined the expected term of employee options
granted based upon a blended average of the Companys
historical experience and historical experience of a number of
peer companies. Prior to the adoption of
SFASNo123R, the Company was estimating the expected
term based on its historical exercise and post-vesting
cancellation experience.   The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual
life of the option is based on the monthly average risk-free
zero-coupon interest rate that corresponds to the expected term.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and
does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.   The Company has used forfeiture rates in its calculation of
share-based compensation expense for the twelve months ending
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, depending on the
stratification of the optionees, based on historical experience
over the term. Share-based compensation expense recognized in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the twelve month
period ending December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is based on
awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. SFAS123R requires forfeitures to be
estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. If pre-vesting forfeitures occur in the future, the
Company will true up expense related to such forfeitures as the
forfeitures occur.   The fair value of each restricted stock unit award is estimated
on the date of grant based on the closing price of the
Companys stock on the grant date. Share-based compensation
expense related to RSUs is recognized over the requisite service
period, adjusted for forfeiture rates depending on the
stratification of the awardees as described above.   Equity
Incentive Program   The Company grants incentive and nonqualified stock options and
RSUs to employees, directors and consultants under the
Amended and Restated 2000 Equity Incentive Plan the 2000
Plan. This plan replaces the 1995 Stock Option Plan.
Stock options expire 10years from the date they are
granted and generally vest over service periods that range from
three months to four years. RSUs give the recipient the
right to receive shares upon the lapse of the instruments
related restrictions. Restrictions on RSUs lapse, in
various increments and on various dates, beginning on the date
of grant through four years. Employees may surrender a portion
of their RSU shares to pay for related employee payroll taxes.   The Company annually increases the number of shares issuable
under the 2000 Plan using a predetermined formula. The maximum
number of shares that can be issued by the 2000 Plan is
6,378,666. As of December31, 2008 the 2000 Plan had issued
4,836,912shares.

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of deferred tax
assets through future taxable income, the Company has provided a
full valuation allowance, and, therefore, no benefit has been
recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax
assets. Approximately $143,000 of these deferred tax assets
pertain to certain net operating loss carryforwards resulting
from the exercise of employee stock options. When recognized,
the tax benefit of these loss carryforwards are accounted for as
a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction
of the income tax provision.   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards in the case of an ownership
change of a corporation. Any ownership changes, as
defined, may restrict utilization of carryovers although the
Company believes that loss carryovers utilized to offset taxable
income in the current year are not subject to restriction.   Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and,
accordingly, no provision for federal and state income taxes
have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings
in the form of a dividend or otherwise, the Company could be
subject to both United States income taxes subject to an
adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes
payable to various foreign countries.   Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes FIN48. This interpretation clarifies
the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under FASB
Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and
requires additional disclosures about uncertain tax positions.
Under FIN48 the financial statement recognition of the
benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being
more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the
applicable taxing authority. If this threshold is met, the tax
benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount
that is greater than 50percent likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. A reconciliation of the beginning and
ending amount of the consolidated liability for unrecognized
income tax benefits during the tax year ended December31,
2008 and 2007 is as follows

on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.
As of December31,2008 and 2007, the Company had
approximately $21,000 and $14,000 of accrued interest related to
uncertain tax positions, respectively.   Since the Company has a full valuation allowance on its deferred
tax assets, recognition of uncertain tax benefits will not
result in an impact on the Companys effective tax rate
except for $47,000 and $21,000 as of December31, 2008 and
2007 respectively, which relate to items that have resulted in
prior period tax expense.   The Companys only major tax jurisdictions are the United
States, Germany and the United Kingdom. The tax years 1995
through 2008 remain open and subject to examination by the
appropriate governmental agencies in the United States, the tax
years 2004 through 2008 remain open and subject to examination
by the appropriate governmental agencies in Germany and the tax

required disclosures. We have carried out an evaluation under
the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and timely reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2008. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Based on our assessment management concluded that, as of
December31, 2008, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on these criteria.   The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report appearing in Item8 of this Annual Report
