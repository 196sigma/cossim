Videonics, Inc.
Campbell, California
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Videonics, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related statements of
income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended  December 31, 1996.  These  financial  statements  are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial  position of Videonics,  Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                       /s/ COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P. San Jose, California

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  Business    Videonics, Inc. the Company was incorporated on July 3, 1986. The
Company is a designer of digital video post-production equipment. The
Company products are used by videographers,  business,  industry,
education and videophiles; they are also used in the broadcast, cable,
video  presentation  and video  conferencing  markets.  The Company
manufactures standalone and personal-computer-based hardware and software
products that edit and mix raw video footage, add special effects and
titles, and process audio and video signals.
2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     Principles of Consolidation     The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of
Videonics, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition     The Company recognizes revenues from gross sales, less a provision for
estimated future customer returns and exchanges, upon shipment of
product.
Research and Development Expenditures     Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as
incurred.
Advertising     The Company expenses the production costs of advertising as the
expenses are incurred. The production costs of advertising consist
primarily of magazine advertisements, agency fees and other direct
production costs.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued     Advertising, continued     Advertising expense for the period ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and
1994 was $947,000, $502,000 and $447,000, respectively.
Income Taxes     Prior to an initial public offering on December 15, 1994, the Company
elected to be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under those provisions, the Company was not
subject to corporate federal taxation. The Company was subject only to
a 15% state surcharge tax. Accordingly, no provision for taxes on
income earned through December 15, 1994 had been made, except for the
state surcharge, because the remaining taxes are the obligation of the
shareholders.
Upon conversion to a C corporation on December 15, 1994, the Company
received a one-time tax benefit of $650,000 see Note 8. In addition,
for the period December 16 through December 31, 1994, the Company was
taxed as a C corporation, and a current tax provision utilizing
statutory rates is accordingly reflected for this period. The Company
uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Cash and Equivalents     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original
maturities at time of purchase of three months or less.
Marketable Securities     Marketable  securities are classified as  available-for-sale  and
therefore are carried at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and
losses on such securities are reported net of related taxes as a
separate component of shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses
on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings and computed
using the specific identification cost method.
Inventories     Inventories  are stated at the lower of  standard  cost which
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
Continued
33                 VIDEONICS, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued     Property and Equipment     Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets
ranging from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on
a straight-line basis over the lesser of the term of the lease or the
estimated useful life of the asset.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets     Capitalized  purchased  technology  and goodwill  relating to an
acquisition see Note 3 are amortized over a seven year life.
Product Warranty     Since 1994, the Company warrants all parts and labor on domestic sales
for two years. The Company provides for the estimated cost to repair or
replace these products at the time of sale.
Concentrations of Credit Risk     Financial  instruments that  potentially  subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable.
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions located in California and in high grade commercial paper
with original maturities of less than three months. As part of its cash
management process, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the
relative credit standing of these financial institutions.
The Company  customer base is dispersed across many different
geographic areas throughout the world and consists principally of
distributors and dealers in the electronics industry. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains an
allowance for potential credit losses. The Company generally receives
confirmed letters of credit or cash in advance of shipping to
distributors located outside North America.
Continued
34                 VIDEONICS, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued     Distributions to Shareholders     The Company made  dividend  distributions  to its S corporation
shareholders in 1994 to cover certain of the income tax liabilities
incurred by such shareholders with respect to the Company earnings.
Since the above  mentioned  distribution  to its S  corporation
shareholders, the Company has not declared or paid dividends on its
common stock.
Computation of Earnings Per Share     Net income per share is calculated using the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the
period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of common shares
issuable upon exercise stock options using the treasury stock method.
Pursuant to Securities and Exchange  Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 83, options to purchase common stock granted with exercise
prices below the assumed initial public offering price per share during
the twelve months preceding the date of the initial filing of the
Registration Statement are included in the calculation of common
equivalent shares, using the treasury stock method, as if they were
outstanding for all periods presented.
Pro Forma Net Income Per Share     For 1994, pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share have
been determined assuming the Company had been taxed as a C corporation
for federal income tax purposes for all periods presented. Pro forma
net income per share has been computed using the weighted average
number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding for
the period. If Net Operating Loss carryforwards were not available for
the year ending December 31, 1994, pro forma net income and pro forma
net income per share  would  have been  $3,424,000  and $079,
respectively.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued     Fair Value of Financial Instruments     Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued 9.  Shareholders' Equity, continued    The Company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic
value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is
measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
Company stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay
to acquire the stock.
The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Had compensation cost for the years ended December 31, 1996
and 1995 been determined based on the fair value at the grant date,
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and been included in the
Company operations, the Company net income and net income per share
for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 would have been reduced to
the pro forma amounts indicated below                            1996      1995

Net income per share - pro forma      $  002    $   063
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes method with the following weighted average
assumptions by subgroup                        1996           1995
