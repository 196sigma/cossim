REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Shareholders SonoSite, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
SonoSite, Inc. andsubsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December31, 2011. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SonoSite, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, SonoSite Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March15, 2012 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. /s/KPMG LLP

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
SonoSite, Inc.: We have
audited SonoSite, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. SonoSites management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
companys annual or interim financial statement will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses related to the lack of appropriate monitoring and review controls over the modification of employment-related agreements
and over the statement of cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards have been identified and included in managements assessment. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of SonoSite, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity and comprehensive
income loss for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2011. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December31, 2011, and this report does not affect our report dated March15, 2012, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. 
In our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned material weaknesses on the achievement of the objectives of the control
criteria, SonoSite, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the criteria established in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. /s/ KPMG LLP Seattle, Washington March15, 2012

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. Business Overview 
SonoSite develops, manufactures, and distributes high performance, innovative ultrasound technology and hand-carried
ultrasound systems for use across medical specialties and in a range of treatment settings. We commenced operations as a
division of ATL Ultrasound, Inc. ATL. On April6, 1998, we became an independent, publicly owned company through a distribution of one new share of our stock for every three shares of ATL stock held as of that date. ATL retained
no ownership in SonoSite following the spin-off. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of presentation and use of estimates 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of SonoSite, Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management must
make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents 
Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts with major U.S. banks and highly liquid debt instruments with maturities at
purchase of three months or less. Investment securities 
Historically, we have held investment securities; however no amounts were held at December31, 2011 and 2010. Investment securities
have primarily consisted of high-grade corporate debt. We classified all securities as available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may have been required prior to maturity to implement management strategies. These securities were carried at
fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, were determined on a specific identification
basis. A decline in market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that was determined to be other than temporary
resulted in a revaluation of its carrying amount to fair value. The impairment related to credit losses was charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security was established. The impairment related to other factors was recognized in other
comprehensive income. Premiums and discounts were amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Interest income was recognized when earned. 
Accounts receivable We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables
based on a combination of factors, including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non-payment, and evaluation of the customers current financial situation. In the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to
meet its full obligation to us, we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon
payment history and our assessment of the customers current credit worthiness. We continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific
customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the
future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, for example as a result of the recent financial and economic turmoil or otherwise, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required. In the ordinary course of business, we grant credit to a broad customer base. Of the accounts receivable balance at
December31, 2011, 71% and 29% were receivable from international and domestic customers, respectively, prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts. The same percentages as of December31, 2010 were 66% and 34% prior to any allowance for
doubtful accounts. Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying value of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain
long-term other assets, approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Financial instruments included in other long-term assets approximate fair
value as interest rates on these items approximate market. 
39 Table of Contents
The fair value hierarchy is followed in calculating fair values. Quoted market prices are
used to calculate the fair value for assets or liabilities with an active market Level 1. Other quoted prices are used for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or with inputs other than quoted prices that are observable and
market corroborated inputs Level 2. Where quoted market prices or other quoted prices are unavailable significant unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value Level 3. 
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates
underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded in other expenses. Historically,
we also utilized foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations, however we ceased using these instruments in 2011. These contracts also did not qualify for
hedge accounting and accordingly were marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded in other expenses. 
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out method. Included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing
department. Adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material, shrinkage, earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product. If market conditions change
or if the introduction of new products by us or our competitors impacts the markets for our previously released products, we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories. 
Property and equipment Property and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, and additions and improvements to property and
equipment are capitalized. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives as follows:  Asset
Estimated Useful Lives Equipment and computers
35 years
Software
3 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Building
25 years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term
The carrying value of long-lived asset groups is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. For depreciable property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset group by comparing the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition with the asset groups net book value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are less than the net
book value of the asset group, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair market value of the asset group. Goodwill and other intangible assets We perform goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests in the fourth quarter and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate reporting unit carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values. Intangible assets subject to amortization,
which consist mainly of customer relationships, acquired technology, trademarks, and non-compete agreements, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to twenty-five years. 
The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is subjective and requires
significant judgment at many points during the analysis, including the identification of our reporting units, identification and allocation of the assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units and determination of fair value. In estimating
the fair value of each reporting unit for the purposes of our annual or periodic impairment analyses, we relied upon estimates and significant judgments about the future cash flows and considered the market value of our publicly traded stock.
Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment charges. We believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management. 
40 Table of Contents
We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. This analysis requires similar significant judgments as those discussed above regarding goodwill, except for cash flows are based on an undiscounted cash flow to determine the
fair value of the intangible. Concentration of credit and supply risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. We depend on some single-source suppliers to provide highly specialized parts and other components, and may
experience an interruption of supply if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our time, quantity and quality requirements. There are relatively few alternative sources of supply for some of these items. A change in demand for some parts by other
companies in our industry could also interrupt our supply of components. Our circuit boards are produced by a large
electronic manufacturing services supplier who produces the boards in their manufacturing facility in Malaysia. If we experience delays in the receipt or deterioration in product yields of these components, we may experience delays in manufacturing
or an increase in costs resulting in lost sales or deterioration in gross margin. Revenue recognition
We recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer, risk of
loss and title have passed to the customer, sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue is recorded net of any discounts, trade-in allowances, and estimated returns. We estimate returns by
reviewing our historical returns, considering customer reaction to new product introductions and current economic conditions. We make product software upgrades or features available for purchase to our customers and recognize revenue in accordance
with software revenue recognition guidance. We recognize licensing revenue using the proportional performance method, a ratable recognition approach over the life of the license. In addition to a standard warranty, we offer extended warranty and
service contracts for coverage beyond the standard warranty period or coverage above what is covered by a standard warranty. Those service contracts are recorded as deferred revenue. For extended warranty and service contracts, revenue is recognized
as services are provided or over the term of the contract. Sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard
distributor agreements. We recognize revenue when risk of loss and title has transferred to the distributor and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Our only significant post-shipment obligation to distributors is our
standard product warranty covering materials and workmanship. The distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error, generally within 30 days of receipt, and in such cases, replacement products would be sent. Since the
distributors remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit and returns are estimable, we do not defer revenue associated with these sales. Costs associated with the repair of returned, defective products are captured in
our warranty liability. Our standard distributor arrangements do not have any other return provisions. Our sales arrangements
may contain multiple elements, which include hardware and software products, as well as services. For the vast majority of our shipments, all deliverables are shipped together. However, in some cases certain elements of a multiple element
arrangement are not delivered as of a reporting date. We allocate consideration in multiple element arrangements using estimated selling prices ESP of deliverables if vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE or third-party
evidence TPE of selling price is unavailable. When the undelivered element represents services under extended service contracts, revenue equal to the stated price is deferred and recognized evenly over the contract term as those
services are provided. Warranty expense We generally offer a five year warranty for our products. We accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties. This provision for
warranty expense is made using managements judgment based upon our historical and anticipated product failure rates and service repair costs. Our warranty period for certain older generation products is one year. We periodically assess the
adequacy of the warranty reserve and adjust the amount as necessary. The warranty is included with the original purchase. 
41 Table of Contents
Research and development 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of equipment acquired for research and development activities
that has alternative future uses. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software-related products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established
are not material, and accordingly, we expense all software-related research and development costs when incurred. 
Advertising costs We expense costs for advertising and promotional activities as incurred. Advertising and promotional expenses for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $190 million, $100 million,
and $97 million. Income taxes Deferred income taxes are provided based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards arising since our inception or obtained through acquisition. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount, if any, expected to be realized. 
The determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of
complex tax laws. Judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements
only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from tax authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the
financial statements as appropriate. Stock-based compensation 
We recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. For
stock options, we utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life,
expected term, and a risk free rate. We estimate volatility by considering our historical stock volatility. We estimate expected life and expected term based on historical trends. The risk free rate is estimated using comparable published federal
funds rates. Further, we estimate future forfeitures for both stock options and restricted stock units granted, which are not expected to vest. We estimate forfeitures using historical forfeiture trends, employee turnover rates as well as our
judgment of future forfeitures. Our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from our estimate. 
Net income per share Basic net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common and
dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common equivalent shares consist of common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options, warrants, and unvested restricted stock units using the treasury stock
method. Diluted net income per share is also impacted to reflect shares issuable upon conversion of our convertible senior notes when our share price exceeds $3820 per share. The call option we purchased is anti-dilutive and, therefore, excluded
from the calculation of diluted net income per share.

The computation of diluted net income per share includes potential dilutive common shares associated with
our convertible senior notes. The convertible senior notes became dilutive for the first time during the fourth quarter of 2011. The following common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive in thousands: Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Stock options and unvested restricted stock 305 679 875 Warrants outstanding 1 1,121 1,121 1,121

As further detailed in note 9, in July 2007 we issued warrants to purchase up to 25million shares of our common stock with a strike price of $46965, which are
anti-dilutive since the strike price of the warrants is greater than the average market price of our common stock. In 2009 and 2008, we repurchased warrants that were for the purchase of up to 04million and 10million shares
respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
Unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments are included in accumulated other
comprehensive income. The following are the components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in thousands:

Accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted 
In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220-Presentation of
Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-05, to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of
comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. ASU 2011-05 is effective for us in the first quarter of
fiscal 2012 and will be applied retrospectively. While ASU 2011-05 will require us to change the manner in which we present other comprehensive income and its components on a retrospective basis, we believe there will be no significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements as a result of adoption. In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
No2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards Topic 820-Fair Value Measurement ASU 2011-04, to provide a
consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles
and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and will be applied prospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU
2011-04, but currently believe there will be no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
3. Acquisition by FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation 
On December15, 2011, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement with
FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, a Japanese corporation, FUJI, and Salmon Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of FUJI, Purchaser, which provides for the acquisition of us
by FUJI in two steps. The first step was a cash tender offer by Purchaser to acquire all of the outstanding shares of our common stock at a price of $5400 per share. The tender offer was completed on February15, 2012. Pursuant to the tender
offer, Purchaser acquired a total of 12,697,279 shares of our common stock, which constitute approximately 8994% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The second step is, following the consummation of the tender offer and subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will merge with and into us, with us as the surviving corporation in the merger the Merger. In the Merger, each outstanding share of our common
stock will be converted into the right to receive $5400 in cash without interest and subject to applicable withholding and transfer taxes. Consummation of the Merger is subject to approval by our shareholders and certain closing conditions. On March29, 2012 a special meeting of our shareholders will be held for the purpose of approving
the Merger Agreement and the related Plan of Merger for the Merger. As a result of the consummation of the tender offer, FUJI beneficially owns and has the right to vote a sufficient number of outstanding shares of our common stock such that
approval of the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger at the special meeting is assured without the affirmative vote of any other shareholder. We expect to complete the Merger shortly after the special meeting, as a result of which, SonoSite will
cease to be a standalone business and will continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of FUJI from and after the effective time of the Merger. On February16, 2012, upon consummation of the tender offer, all unvested stock options and restricted stock units were accelerated to fully vest and terminated. The acceleration of unvested stock
options and restricted stock units were not determined probable of occurring as of December31, 2011 given the uncertainty of the tender offer process. On February21, 2012, we entered into a loan agreement with FUJI for approximately
$681 million, the proceeds of which were used to finance our obligations with respect to the termination of our outstanding options and restricted stock units. For the initial term through March31, 2012 and each successive three-month periods
ending on June30,September30,December31 and March31 of each year, the interest rate per annum is equal to LIBOR plus 08%. Stock options were cashed out on February22, 2012 for an amount equal to the
difference between the exercise price per share of the applicable stock option and $5400 per share. Restricted stock units were cashed out on February22, 2012 for an amount equal to $5400 per share. Total cash paid for the stock options and
restricted stock was approximately $681 million. Upon the closing of the tender offer, certain contingent expenses became
payable. These expenses include approximately $327 million primarily related to investment banking fees. Following the
consummation of the Merger, the warrant holders will be paid approximately $207 million. Upon closing of the tender offer,
which is a fundamentalchange for the senior convertible notes, the note holders may require us to repurchase the notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a
fundamentalchange. The repurchase of convertible notes was not determined probable of occurring as of December31, 2011 given the uncertainty of the tender offer process. In addition, we will adjust the conversion rate for holders who
elect to convert notes in connection with the fundamental change. The principal amount of the outstanding senior convertible notes is $1147 million and the estimated value of conversion adjustment is $546 million.

6. Investment in affiliate 
During 2010, we invested $80 million in Carticept Medical Inc. Carticept, a privately held company that
develops innovative products for the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries. Concurrently, we entered a joint distribution arrangement with Carticept. Additionally, our chief executive officer is on the board of directors. This investment is
accounted for as a cost basis investment as we own less than 20% of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence.We will regularly evaluate the carrying value of this cost-method investment for impairment and
whether any events or circumstances are identified that would significantly impair the fair value of the investment. No event has occurred that would adversely affect the carrying value of this investment. 
In December 2011 Carticept completed a spin-off of its wholly owned subsidiary, Cartiva Inc. Cartiva, through a stock
dividend of Cartiva stock to the Carticept stockholders. We do not have a seat on the board of directors of Cartiva. At the same time of the Cartiva stock dividend there was a sale of stock to the current Carticept investors. We invested on a
pro-rata basis with all other investors $17 million in this issuance of Carticept stock. This additional investment did not affect our percentage ownership in Carticept. Because we hold 14% of the voting equity interests and are a distributor of Carticept they represent a related party. During 2011 and 2010, we have recognized revenue from Carticept of $47 million and
$13 million, respectively. Accounts receivable from Carticept as of December31, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $16 million and $03 million, respectively. 
46 Table of Contents 7. Acquisitions 
VisualSonics, Inc. On June30, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of VisualSonics, Inc. VisualSonics, a leader in the development, manufacturing, and marketing of ultra high-resolution,
ultrasound-based imaging technology micro-ultrasound designed to enable discovery research, medical diagnosis and imaging small physiological structures in humans and animals. VisualSonics micro-ultrasound product platform
currently serves the pre-clinical research market. We intend to integrate VisualSonics micro-ultrasound technology with our miniaturization competency and user design to deliver ultra high-frequency micro-ultrasound into clinical medicine.
Cash consideration of $645 million was transferred for the shares of VisualSonics. During 2010, the results of
VisualSonics operations are included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Operating
expenses include acquisition related charges of $42 million for the year ended December31, 2010. The following table
summarizes the acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with the business combination as revised in thousands:  June30,2010 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 3,322 Accounts receivable 4,538 Inventories 5,002 Deferred income taxes 1,224 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,160

Total current liabilities 5,807 Long-term debt 8,828 Deferred tax liabilities 2,403 Other non-current liabilities 371 
Total liabilities 17,409 
Net assets acquired 64,762 
During the measurement period for the year ended December31, 2011 we obtained information related
to the tax effects of the acquisition and the ability to utilize pre-acquisition tax credits to offset tax liabilities arising on the distribution of certain assets acquired. This resulted in an increase to deferred tax liabilities of $12 million
and an increase to goodwill of $12 million, which is reflected in the table above. The measurement period ended on June30, 2011. These assets and liabilities were recorded at the acquisition-date fair value. We used an income approach, which is a measurement of the present value of the net economic benefit or cost
expected to be derived from an asset or liability, to measure the acquired assets and liabilities excluding inventory, and property and equipment. Inventory was measured using a cost approach. Property and equipment were valued using a combination
of the market and cost approaches. 
47 Table of Contents
We used the following methods to measure fair value of intangible assets:  Developed technology and customer relations were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method  Trademarks were valued using the relief from royalty method The fair value of the identified intangible assets was estimated by performing a discounted cash flow analysis using the income approach. This method includes a forecast of direct revenues and
costs associated with the respective intangible assets and charges for economic returns on tangible and intangible assets utilized in cash flow generation. Net cash flows attributable to the identified intangible assets were discounted to their
present value at a rate commensurate with the perceived risk. The projected cash flow assumptions considered contractual relationships, customer attrition and the tax amortization benefit. 
Intangibles assets acquired consisted of the following in thousands: Amount AmortizationPeriodinyears Trademarks 3,060 25 Developed technology 22,620 3to10 Customer relationships 7,230 5 to 7 
Total intangibles 32,910 The total fair value of trade receivables acquired amounted to $45 million which equated the amount due
on these receivables. We recognized a warranty liability of $01 million related to VisualSonics products, representing
potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that we could be required to make under the warranty arrangements. We incurred the majority of these costs by the end of 2011. 
We recognized a deferred tax asset of $83 million, which includes foreign net operating loss carryforward of $10 million, foreign
research and experimentation expense carryforward of $51 million, and foreign research and experimentation tax credit carryforward of $18 million. Additionally, deferred tax liabilities of $83 million were recorded relating to acquired intangible
assets. A valuation allowance was established of $04 million on the net deferred tax assets of VisualSonics. The net operating loss was generated in 2010 and will expire in 2030. The research and experimentation expense carryforward has an
indefinite life and the research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards expire from 2025 through 2030. The results of
VisualSonics operations has been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. For comparability purposes, the following table presents our pro forma revenue and net income loss for the twelve months ended
December31, 2010 and 2009, had the VisualSonics acquisition date been January1, 2009 in thousands:  Unaudited Revenue Netincomeloss VisualSonics Actual from June30, 2010 to December31, 2010 17,626 958 Supplemental pro forma from the combined entity for the period January1, 2010 to December31, 2010 1 291,010 8,379 January1, 2009 to December31, 2009 266,520 2,191

Pro forma net income loss excluded acquisition and integration charges of $42 million. 
Because VisualSonics fiscal year end was September, three months prior to our year-end, revenue and net income loss in the pro forma
disclosures have been adjusted to reflect our fiscal year. Additionally, VisualSonics earnings were adjusted to reflect the statutory tax rate utilized by VisualSonics in the pro forma periods presented. Pro forma net income loss excludes
non-recurring charges including acquisition costs and expenses-related to long-term debt and liability classified equity instruments, but includes amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation resulting from this acquisition.
CardioDynamics International Corporation In August 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of CardioDynamics International Corporation CDIC, a leader in impedance cardiography ICG for noninvasive hemodynamic
assessment that develops, manufactures, and markets ICG devices and sensors. The ICG product line provides non-invasive assessment of cardiac output and other hemodynamic parameters. The business combination enables us to expand our distribution
platform and product offerings into primary care.

Concurrently with this acquisition, we obtained full control of Medis Medizinische
Messtechnik GmbH Medis, which develops, manufactures, and markets ICG diagnostic and monitoring devices. CDIC had previously owned 80% of Medis, based in Germany. 
Cash consideration of $107 million was transferred for the shares of CDIC and Medis. The results of CDICs operations have been
included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The following table summarizes the
acquisition-date fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with the business combination in thousands:  August14,2009 Assets Current assets Cash and cash equivalents 2,511 Accounts receivable 2,627 Inventories 2,885 Deferred income taxes 5,376 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 95

These assets and liabilities were recorded at the acquisition-date fair value. We used an income
approach, which is a measurement of the present value of the net economic benefit or cost expected to be derived from an asset or liability, to measure the acquired assets and liabilities excluding inventory, internally developed software, and
property and equipment. Inventory and internally developed software were measured using a cost approach. Property and equipment were valued using a combination of the market and cost approaches.

We used the following methods to measure fair value of intangible assets:  Developed technology and customer relations were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method  Trademarks were valued using the relief from royalty method  Internally developed software was valued using the cost approach 
The total fair value of short-term and long-term receivables acquired amounted to $27 million. The contractual amount due on these
receivables was $38 million, of which a reduction of $11 million was taken for credit risk. We recognized a warranty
liability of $03 million related to CDICs products. As of December31, 2011, the remaining liability was $015 million. We recognized a deferred tax asset of $54 million, which includes $39 million related to CDICs federal net operating loss NOL carryforward. CDIC had federal NOL carryforwards of
$526 million based on tax returns filed through November30, 2008 which expire between 2010 and 2028. The NOL carryforward that will be available for utilization during this period is limited to $115 million, resulting from change in
ownership limitations under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We recognized an additional $15 million deferred tax asset and a $46 million deferred tax liability related to differences in the book and tax bases of acquired assets and
liabilities. We assumed $56 million in long-term debt, of which $53 million was repaid immediately. As of December31,
2011, we had no long-term debt as the $03 million was repaid during the year. LumenVu, Inc. 
In July 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of LumenVu, Inc. LumenVu, a private development stage company that
developed, in conjunction with a leading academic research institution, a patented technology to improve the accuracy of catheter placement. The technology was exclusively licensed to LumenVu by a leading academic research institution. We intend to
integrate this technology in a new product line that can be sold along with existing product lines in certain clinical markets. 
The results of LumenVus operations were included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. The
acquisition, which was an asset purchase, had a purchase price that consisted of cash consideration of $29 million, note receivable forgiveness of $01 million, assumed liabilities of $06 million, which were paid at closing, and contingent future
cash payments up to $100 million, which had an estimated fair value of $40 million at the date of acquisition. The future cash payments are contingent upon the continued development of the product and recognizing revenue from the sale of products
incorporating this technology. The liability for contingent consideration is accreted to other expense over the expected payment period. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we determined that, based upon our projected product development and release dates, maximum liability for future contingent consideration would not be required. We
determined the fair value of future contingent consideration was $22 million. Accordingly, we reduced the liability for contingent consideration by $40 million as well reduced the deferred tax liability by $23 million and intangible assets by
$63 million. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $02 million, $05 million and $10 million, respectively, of accretion
expense. The fair value of assets acquired determined as of July 2007 was $118 million. Based upon the revised fair value of future contingent consideration determined in fourth quarter of 2010, the fair value of the assets acquired was $55
million. This amount was allocated to an intangible technology asset, which will be amortized over ten years commencing with sales of products incorporating this technology. No amortization expense has been recorded as no products using this
technology are available for sale as of December31, 2011. The amortization of this intangible technology asset is not deductible for tax purposes accordingly we have recorded a deferred tax liability of $20 million. Additionally, we recorded
a deferred tax asset associated with net operating losses of LumenVu of $02 million. SonoMetric Health, Inc.
In May 2004, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of SonoMetric Health, Inc. SonoMetric. The
results of SonoMetrics operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. We purchased all of SonoMetrics outstanding common shares for an immediate cash payment of $15 million, plus future cash
payments of up to $45 million contingent upon the amount of revenue recognized from the sale of the purchased software over the five-year period following the closing date of the acquisition. We accrued contingent payments of $01 million as of
December31, 2009 as a result of revenue recognized on the sale of the software. These contingent payments, which were measured and required through April 2009, were recorded as goodwill. We made the final contingent payment in the first
quarter of 2010.

Total intangible assets 40,139 47,423 
The goodwill associated with VisualSonics has been recorded in the functional currency of VisualSonics,
which is the Canadian dollar. The translated balance of Goodwill decreased by $074 million in 2011 and increased by $24 million in 2010, due to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar value against the US dollar. As of December31, 2011 definite
lived intangible assets had a remaining weighted average useful life of 87 years. Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $65 million, $53 million and $15 million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $54 million in 2012, $46 million in 2013, $41 million in 2014, $29 million in 2015 and $19 million in 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed our annual impairment
assessments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that they were not impaired. If an impairment arose, these assets would be measured at fair value. 
9. Hedging activities 
We are exposed to foreign currency risk from both trade receivable balances denominated in a currency other than the
local currency and intercompany receivable balances denominated in currencies other than US Dollar USD and from translation of our foreign subsidiaries operating results. We enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
reduce the impact of fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. These foreign currencies include the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the European Union euro, and the Japanese yen. We
use foreign exchange contracts to mitigate risk and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Currently our foreign exchange contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. We seek to manage the counterparty risk associated with
engaging in foreign currency contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a substantial portion of our intercompany receivable balances denominated in currencies other than the USD. As of December31, 2011, and 2010 we had
$342 million and $418 million, respectively, in notional amount of foreign currency contracts that expired or will expire January31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Gains and losses in the fair value of these contracts are intended to offset
the losses and gains, resulting from the changes in the underlying intercompany balances. The fair value of these contracts as of December31, 2011 and 2010 was not material to our results of operations or our financial position. 
We have used foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translation of the
financial statements of our foreign operations. As of December31, 2011, we had no foreign currency contracts for this purpose. As of December31, 2010, we had $84 million in notional amount of foreign currency contracts expiring at
various dates through September 2011. The fair value of these contracts, which were Level 2 securities, as of December31, 2010 was a liability of $04 million. Recognized gains and losses, which are included in other expense on the consolidated statements of income, are as follows in thousands: Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Hedges of intercompany balances Loss on foreign currency hedges 1,496 4,003 3,384 Gain loss on translation of intercompany receivables 813 1,511 3,047 Hedges of translation of foreign operations Loss on foreign currency hedges 198 783 337

51 Table of Contents 10. Long-term debt 
In July 2007, we completed the offering of $2250 million aggregate principal amount of 375% convertible senior notes
Notes, which are due in 2014. The Notes may be converted, under certain circumstances described below, based on an initial conversion rate of 261792 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes which is equivalent to
an initial conversion price of approximately $3820 pershare. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $2176 million, after deducting debt issuance costs. The Notes have no restrictive covenants and the if-converted value is
approximately equivalent to the current principal outstanding. To account for the Notes, we bifurcated a component of the
conversion option which is required to be classified in equity. The accretion of the resulting discount on the debt is recognized as part of interest expense in our consolidated statement of income in a manner that reflects the issuers
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized. We calculated the fair value of the liability component of the Notes using a discount rate of similar liabilities without conversion features and determined the carrying amount of
the equity component by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial carrying value of the convertible debt. This resulted in an initial recognition of $639 million of debt discount, to be amortized over a seven year period
at an effective interest rate of 85%, and a corresponding deferred tax liability of $236 million. Additionally, $21 million of debt issuance costs, which were included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet, were classified as equity
on a proportionate basis as the equity component. The following table summarizes the carrying value of the debt and equity
components in thousands:  As of December31 2011 2010 Equity component 33,957 33,957 
Senior convertible debt Outstanding 114,745 114,745 Debt discount 12,902 17,647 
Senior convertible, net 101,843 97,098 
We pay cash interest on the Notes at an annual rate of 375%, payable semi-annually on January15
and July15 of each year, which began on January15, 2008. In connection with the offering, we used a portion of
the offering proceeds to enter into a convertible note hedge transaction whereby we purchased a call option for up to 25million shares of our common stock at a price of $381982 per share. These options, which hedge approximately 42% of the
risk of additional share issuance, expire on July15, 2014 and must be settled in net shares. The cost of the call option was $286 million and has been recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity. The tax benefit from the deduction
related to the purchase of the call option as part of the convertible note hedge transaction is recorded to additional paid in capital over the term of the hedge transaction. Additionally, to partially offset the cost of the convertible note hedge transaction, we sold warrants to purchase up to 25million shares of our common stock at a price of $46965 per share. The
warrants expire on various dates from October15, 2014 through the 60th scheduled trading day following October15, 2014 and must be settled in net shares. We received approximately $195 million in cash proceeds from the sales of these
warrants and they were recorded as an increase to stockholders equity. The debt discount and debt issuance costs are being
amortized through July 2014. Interest expense for the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs was $51 million, $49 million and $50 million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Interest expense for the
contractual coupon was $45 million, $43 million and $49 million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. 
In 2008, we repurchased $803 million in principal amount of our senior convertible notes for $624 million. As a result of these
repurchases, we recorded a gain, net of deferred financing costs and costs to complete the repurchase transaction, of $82 million in other income,. The payment received from partially unwinding the associated convertible note hedges resulted in
proceeds to us of approximately $64 million, offset by $59 million we paid for the repurchase of warrants. The transaction also resulted in a write off of $15 million of debt issuance costs. Following the repurchases, debt issuance costs
approximated $27 million. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, net of issuance costs, the convertible note hedge transaction, and the warrant transaction were $2085 million. 
In 2009, we repurchased $300 million in principal amount of our Notes for $252 million. As a result of these repurchases, we recorded a
gain of $11 million in other income, net of deferred financing costs of $05 million and costs to complete the repurchase

transaction. We also partially unwound the associated convertible note hedges, which resulted in proceeds to us of approximately $16 million for the sale of call options, offset by $15 million
we paid for the repurchase of warrants. Following the repurchases, unamortized debt issuance costs approximated $18 million. The total remaining discount in 2009 after these activities was $177 million which is being amortized over 35 years.
Repurchases in 2009 also resulted in the reduction of the carrying value of the equity component by $35 million, the
allocated amount from repurchases of our senior convertible debt, and $02 million from the write-off of the deferred tax asset related to debt issuance costs,offset by a $17 million reduction of the deferred tax liability related to the debt
discount. These were noncash items from the repurchase transaction. Holders of our remaining outstanding Notes may convert
their Notes based on an initial conversion rate of 261792 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment, at their option at any time prior to April15, 2014 under the following circumstances:
1during any fiscal quarter beginning after September30, 2007 and only during such fiscal quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day of such preceding fiscal quarter; 2during the five business day period after any
ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note foreach day of that ten consecutive trading day period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such
day; or 3upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions. On or after April15, 2014, holders may convert their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the
maturity date. Upon conversion, we will pay cash and shares of our common stock, if any, based on a daily conversion rate
multiplied by a volume weighted average price of our common stock during a specified period following the conversion date. Conversions will be settled in cash up to the principal amount of the Notes, with any conversion value above the principal
amount settled in shares of our common stock. Holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest upon the occurrence of a
fundamentalchange. In addition, we will adjust the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert notes in connection with a fundamental change. We may not redeem any of the Notes at our option prior to maturity. 
Our senior convertible debt is measured for disclosure only at fair value using quoted market prices Level 1. As of December31,
2011 and 2010, the fair value of our senior convertible debt was $1672 million and $1260 million. 
11. Shareholders equity 
Stock compensation plans At December31, 2011, we had seven stock-based employee compensation plans: the 1998 Nonofficer Employee Stock Option Plan 1998 NOE Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan 1998
Plan, the Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan Director Plan, the Amended and Restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan 2005 Plan, the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2005 ESPP Plan, 2010 Equity
Incentive Plan VisualSonics Plan and the 2011 Non Plan 2011 Non Plan. Total stock-based
compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income consisted of the following in thousands:  Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Stock options 1,624 1,210 972 Restricted stock units 6,286 5,167 5,362 Employee stock purchase plan 218 
Total stock-based compensation 7,910 6,377 6,552 
The related deferred tax benefit was $29 million, $23 million and $24 million for the years ended
December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. As part of the acquisition of VisualSonics, we assumed options to purchase common
shares and restricted stock units granted by VisualSonics under the VisualSonics Plan prior to the acquisition.The number of shares of our common stock underlying the assumed options is 287,750, and the exercise prices for the assumed
options are equal to the fair market value of VisualSonics 
53 Table of Contents
common shares at the date of grant, adjusted upon acquisition pursuant to an agreed upon exchange ratio that reflected the fair market value of our common stock on the date of acquisition and the
consideration attributable to each VisualSonics common share in the acquisition.The assumed stock options began to vest and become exercisable with respect to 25% of each grant beginning on June30, 2011 and on each of the three
anniversaries thereafter, and have a seven year term from the grant date.The number of shares of our common stock underlying the assumed RSUs is 345,689.Most of the assumed restricted stock units will vest with respect to one-third
1/3of each grant beginning on June30, 2013 and on each of the two anniversaries thereafter; however, certain assumed restricted stock unit grants will vest entirely on June30, 2013. No shares are available for grant under the
VisualSonics Plan. Under the 1998 NOE Plan, 1998 Plan, 2005 Plan, 2011 Non Plan and option grants outside our stock
option plans, as of December31, 2011, 8,285,730 total shares of common stock were authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock options and release of restricted stock units at prices equal to the fair market value of our common
shares at the date of grant. As of December31, 2011, 1,791,888 of those shares granted under the plans were still outstanding, and 1,447,096 shares were still available for grant under these stock option plans. In most cases, stock options
vest 25% each year over a four year vesting period. Certain stock options vest 25% after one year of employment and then monthly over the next three years, and certain grants made to employees after their first year of employment vest monthly over
four years. All options have either a seven or ten year term from the grant date. Under the Director Plan, as of
December31, 2004, 125,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance of stock options at prices equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant. At December31, 2005, there were no longer shares available
for grant under this Plan. Stock options are exercisable and vest in full one year following their grant date provided the optionee has continued to serve as our director. Each option expires on the earlier of ten years from the grant date or 90
days following the termination of a directors service as our director. The 2005 ESPP Plan, which qualifies under
Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code, permits all U.S. based employees to purchase shares of our common stock. Participating employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at the end of each participation period at a
purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or the end of the participation period. The 2005 ESPP was discontinued in 2009. As of December31, 2011 1,000,000 shares of common stock were
authorized for issuance under the 2005 ESPP Plan. During the year ended December31, 2009 66,498 shares of common stock were issued under this plan. Prior to the spin-off from ATL, we had no stock option plans specifically identified as our plans. All stock options granted through that date were part of ATL option plans. 
The fair value for stock option awards and shares associated with the employee stock purchase plan was estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  Stock Options ESPP YearEndedDecember31 YearEndedDecember31 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Expected term in years 40 50 05 Expected stock price volatility 34 34 46 Risk-free interest rate 095 23 11 Expected dividend yield 00 00 00 Weighted average fair value of options granted 761 731 567
The expected term of the options and ESPP represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is
based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock over the
historical period commensurate with the expected term assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term. We have not paid dividends in the past and do
not plan to pay any dividends in the near future.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is based on our stock price of $5386 on
December31, 2011, which would have been received by the optionees, without reduction for applicable income taxes, had all options been exercised on that date. As of December31, 2011, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense
related to nonvested stock options was $28 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 227 years. During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the total intrinsic value of stock
options exercised was $57 million, $33 million and $01 million, respectively. We issue new shares of common stock upon
exercise of stock options. The following is a summary of stock options outstanding as of December31, 2011 shares

Restricted stock units 
We have granted restricted stock unit RSU awards to employees under the 1998 Plan, 2005 Plan VisualSonics Plan and the
2011 Non Plan. Under the 1998 Plan and 2005, the vesting period for our RSU awards is three years from the date of grant excluding Director RSU grants, which vest annually over three years. Under the VisualSonics Plan, awards vest annually
over three years starting three years after date of grant. As of December31, 2011, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSU awards was $14 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of approximately 245 years. The following table presents summary RSU award activity for the year ended

Non-vested, end of year 751 3152 
We issue new shares of common stock upon the vesting of restricted stock units. 
Stock repurchases We received authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to $1500 million of our common stock or convertible debt. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time
without notice. During 2010, we repurchased 4,240,974shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate price of $1261 million at an average price of $2972. These repurchases were made using existing cash resources. 
Stock purchase rights In April 1998, we and First Chicago Trust Company of New York First Chicago entered into a Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement was subsequently amended in October 2001 to reflect that
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. had succeeded First Chicago as the rights agent, and in August 2003, and again in November 2007, to reflect that Computershare Trust Company N.A. had succeeded EquiServe and to adopt certain changes approved by our
Board of Directors. The Rights Agreement has certain anti-takeover provisions, which will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us. Under the Rights Agreement, each of our shareholders has one share purchase right
for each share of common stock held, with each right having an exercise price approximating our board of directors estimate of the long-term value of one share of our common stock. The rights are triggered if an acquiror acquires, or
successfully makes a tender offer for, 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. In such event, each shareholder other than the acquiror would have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, a number of newly issued shares of our capital stock
at a 50% discount. If the acquiror were to acquire 50% or more of our assets or earning power, each shareholder would have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, a number of shares of acquirors stock at a 50% discount. Our board of
directors may redeem the rights at a nominal cost at any time before a person acquires 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, which allows board-approved transactions to proceed. In addition, our board of directors may exchange all or part of
the rights other than rights held by the acquiror for such number of shares of our common stock equal in value to the exercise price. Such an exchange produces the desired dilution without actually requiring our shareholders to purchase shares.
The Rights Agreement expires on April5, 2013. On December15, 2011, in connection with the Merger, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Rights Agreement, which, among other things, amended the definition of Acquiring
Person to exclude FUJI and Purchaser.

Net deferred tax assets 11,026 10,363 
The total valuation allowance of $32 million includes a $11 million valuation allowance established
against state NOL carry forwards and $01 million of AMT credit carry forward acquired from CDIC, a $03 million valuation allowance established against capital loss carry forwards, and $17 million related to the net deferred tax asset of
VisualSonics. Our increase in valuation allowance of $12 million in 2011 is mainly attributable to the valuation allowance recorded for the full year research credit and NOL generated by VisualSonics. We considered the positive and negative
evidence related to the realization of the net deferred tax assets at this entity and concluded that it is not more likely than not that these assets will be realized, therefore a full valuation allowance has been recorded. 
During 2009, a deferred tax asset amounting to $39 million was recorded related to CDICs federal NOL carryforwards, which were
based on tax returns filed through November30, 2008, and which expire between 2010 and 2028. In 2010, we increased the deferred tax asset related to CDICs federal NOL carryforward by $02 million. The CDIC federal NOL carryforwards that
will be available for utilization during this period are limited to $115 million, resulting from change in ownership limitations under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Through December31, 2011, the Company has recognized $25
million of the CDIC federal NOL as utilized. The deferred tax asset at December31, 2011 is $32 million. In 2011, a deferred tax asset continues to be recorded related to CDICs state NOL carry forwards of $12 million for which future
utilization is not considered more likely than not based on the weight of all positive and negative factors. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded with respect to CDICs state NOLs. 
During 2010, we acquired VisualSonics which had the following tax attribute carry forwards at acquisition: net operating loss carry
forward of $10 million, research and experimentation expense carry forward of $51 million, and research and experimentation tax credit carryforward of $18 million. A valuation allowance was established of $04 million on the net deferred tax
assets of VisualSonics. The NOL was generated in 2010 and will expire in 2030. The NOL generated in 2011 will expire in 2031. The research and experimentation expense carry forward has an indefinite life and the research and experimentation tax
credit carry forwards expire from 2025 through 2031. We have a deferred tax asset of $06 million related to foreign NOL
carryforwards, which do not expire. Under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the availability and utilization of our domestic NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to further limitation if it should be
determined that there has been a change in ownership of more than 50%. US income and foreign withholding taxes have not been
provided on approximately $46million of cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and equity investees. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the US, in the form
of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any,
is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. 
58 Table of Contents
We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such
earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested. Determination of unrecorded deferred taxes on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries is not practicable. The amount of unremitted foreign earnings deemed permanently reinvested at December31, 2011
and 2010 is $134 million and $83 million, respectively. Our unrecognized tax benefits relate to various foreign
jurisdictions and U.S. federal and state tax position. A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands:  AsofDecember31 2011 2010 Beginning of year 3,496 5,178 Prior year tax positions increases 1,423 Prior year tax positions decreases 292 683 Current year tax positions 192 429 Current year tax positions decreases 14 Settlements with taxing authorities 113 1,408 Acquired unrecognized tax benefits 92 Foreign currency translation 34 98 
End of year 4,672 3,496 
Of the $47 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2011, $35 million would reduce
income tax expense if ultimately recognized. We do not expect any other significant increases or decreases to our unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date. 
Interest and penalties incurred associated with unresolved income tax positions are included in income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties amounted to approximately $08 million at the end of 2011 and was $04 million at the end of 2010. In the normal course of
business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the U.S., Canada, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax
examinations for years after 2003. However, carry forward attributes that were generated prior to 2004 may still be adjusted by a taxing authority upon examination if the attributes have been or will be used in a future period 
13. Employee Benefit Plan 
401k Retirement Savings Plan All our employees in the U.S. are eligible to participate in our 401k Plan. Terms of the 401k Plan permit an employee to contribute up to a maximum permissible by the Internal Revenue Service during
any plan year. At our discretion, we match each employees contribution in increments equivalent to 100% for the first 3% and 50% for the second 3% of the employees contribution percentage. In February 2009, we suspended matching
contribution to the 401k Plan for 2009 and 2010. In 2011, 2010 and 2009 we contributed $07 million, $00 million and $03 million in matching contributions to the 401k Plan in accordance with the plans terms. Employees immediately vest in
the contributions the employee makes. Vesting in our contribution on behalf of the employee occurs at equal increments at the end of each year of the first five years of an employees service with us. 
14. Commitments and contingencies 
Indemnification Obligations and Guarantees excluding product warranty 
We provide iindemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property
infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products; iiindemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products; iiiindemnifications of
varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us; and ivguarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments. These indemnifications and guarantees
require only disclosure. To date, we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements
related to these indemnifications or guarantees.

Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $45 million, $40 million and
$35 million. Other commitments As part of our agreements with our suppliers, suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to
them. In the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing, material changes or design changes, we may be responsible for compensating our
suppliers for these procurements. In the U.S., we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group
purchasing agreements with major healthcare GPOs. Typically, a GPO negotiates with medical suppliers, such as us, on behalf of the GPOs member healthcare facilities, providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions. In
exchange, the GPO identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members. Member facilities participating in the GPOs purchasing program can consist of hospitals, medical group practices, nursing homes, surgery centers, managed care
organizations, long term care facilities, clinics and integrated delivery networks. These agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we
recorded fees related to these agreements as sales, general and administrative expenses of $28 million, $24 million and $19 million, respectively. Contingencies On May15, 2007, GE Healthcare GE filed a
lawsuit against us in the federal district court in the Western District of Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that certain of our products willfully infringed certain of GEs U.S. patents relating to ultrasound technology. We filed a counterclaim
against GE and certain of its affiliates, and filed an answer denying all of GEs claims and alleging that the asserted patents are either invalid, not infringed, or both. In rulings issued on July24, 2008, the trial judge granted summary
judgment motions in our favor on five of the six patents that GE had asserted against us. The court ruled that one of the GE patents is invalid and that our products do not infringe the other four GE patents. The trial judge also granted summary
judgment in GEs favor on two of our four asserted patents finding that GEs accused products did not infringe our asserted patents. On July28, 2008 the parties filed a stipulation for dismissal without prejudice for the remaining
claims and counterclaims for the three remaining patents that have yet to be ruled on by summary judgment in this case, thereby negating the need for a trial. On July31, 2008, the court granted the parties request for dismissal of the
remaining claims and counterclaims that had not been ruled on by the judge. The parties appealed certain of the trial
courts summary judgment decisions and other rulingsto theCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.Oral argument at the Federal Circuit took place in early July 2009. 
On May22, 2008, GE filed a second suit in the same federal court in Wisconsin seeking to invalidate our U.S. patent 5,722,412
the 412 patent. We counterclaimed that the new ultrasound systems GE proposes to market and sell infringe this patent. The trial was held in early June 2009 and post trial briefing took place during the month of July. 
In October 2009, we settled all pending patent litigation worldwide with GE. Under the settlement agreement, both parties agreed to
dismiss their claims against each other in all pending litigation. The parties entered into worldwide cross-licenses of the patents in litigation, including a license of the 412 patent by us to GE, and provided each other with mutual releases.
In exchange for the 412 license, GE paid an upfront fee of $21 million to us and will also make ongoing royalty payments on US sales and production of hand-carried ultrasound systems. We will receive these royalty payments until the 412
patent expires in June 2016. As part of the

settlement, we also entered an arrangement with GE to create a foundation to fund research, education and training of best practices for point-of-care ultrasound. We recognize licensing revenue
using the proportional performance method, a ratable recognition approach over the life of the license. During 2010, we took
action to ensure compliance with certain contractual pricing agreements.We paid $08 million and recorded a liability of $03 million that we believe represents our obligation. Final settlement has not been reached with the customer.
On December21, 2011, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Washington in Snohomish County
in connection with the planned acquisition of SonoSite by FUJI. The plaintiff, David Raul as custodian for Pinchus E. Raul Utma NY, purports to bring this suit as a class action on behalf of the public stockholders of SonoSite. The complaint names
SonoSite and each of our eight directors then in office as defendants and alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to follow a proper sales procedure and failing to procure a fair price for the shareholders of SonoSite,
and that SonoSite aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by the directors. The complaint does not name FUJI or Purchaser as a defendant. A second purported class action lawsuit was filed in connection with the planned acquisition of SonoSite by FUJI in the Superior Court of Washington in King County on December 21, 2011. An amended
complaint was filed on January 23, 2012. The plaintiff, Rohit Sangal, purports to bring this suit as a class action on behalf of the public stockholders of SonoSite. In addition to SonoSite and each of its eight directors then in office, the
complaint also names FUJI and Purchaser as defendants. The complaint alleges that SonoSites directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to follow a proper sales procedure and failing to procure a fair price for the shareholders of
SonoSite. The complaint also alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties through materially inadequate disclosures and material omissions. In addition, the complaint alleges that each of SonoSite, FUJI and Purchaser aided and abetted
the breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board of Directors of SonoSite. A third purported class action lawsuit was filed in
connection with the planned acquisition of SonoSite by FUJI in the Superior Court of Washington in King County on February 2, 2012. The plaintiffs, Raymond Montminy, Sr. and Brian Snow, purport to bring this suit as a class action on behalf of the
public stockholders of SonoSite. The complaint alleges that SonoSites directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to follow a proper sales procedure and failing to procure a fair price for the shareholders of SonoSite. The complaint
also alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties through materially inadequate disclosures and material omissions. In addition, the complaint alleges that SonoSite aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board of
Directors of SonoSite. The complaint names SonoSite and each of its eight directors then in office as defendants, but does not name FUJI or Purchaser as a defendant. All plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, damages in an unspecified amount, and attorneys fees and costs. On January 5, 2012, the Snohomish County court approved the transfer of the Raul action to King County. On February 6, 2012, the parties filed with the King County Superior Court a stipulation and
proposed order to consolidate the three lawsuits. Also on February 6, 2012, the King County Superior Court entered an order formally consolidating the three lawsuits under the caption In re SonoSite, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, Case No.
11-2-44110-5 SEA, and appointing lead counsel for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint in the consolidated action on February 7, 2012. While SonoSite, the individual defendants, FUJI and Purchaser all believe that each of the aforementioned lawsuits is entirely without merit and that they have valid defenses to all claims, in an effort
to minimize the cost and expense of any litigation relating to such lawsuits, on February 8, 2012, they entered into a memorandum of understanding the MOU with the plaintiffs in the three purported class action lawsuits pending in King
County Superior Court, pursuant to which the parties agreed to settle the lawsuits. Subject to court approval and further definitive documentation, the MOU resolves the claims brought by the plaintiffs in all of the aforementioned lawsuits against
the defendants in relation to the planned acquisition of SonoSite by FUJI and provides a release and settlement by the purported class of SonoSites shareholders of all claims against the defendants and their affiliates and agents in connection
with the planned acquisition of SonoSite by FUJI. In exchange for such release and settlement, pursuant to the terms of the MOU, the parties agreed, after arms-length discussions between and among the parties and their counsel, that SonoSite
would provide additional supplemental disclosures to its Schedule 14D-9 as set forth in the Amendment No. 2 to its Schedule 14D-9. In addition, SonoSite also agreed in the MOU to pay $475,000 in fees and expenses to plaintiffs lead counsel
after the settlement contemplated by the MOU becomes final. The settlement, including the payment by SonoSite of attorneys fees and expenses to plaintiffs lead counsel, is also contingent upon, among other things, the approval of the
King County Superior Court. In the event that the settlement contemplated by the MOU is not approved and all other conditions are not satisfied, FUJI and Purchaser will continue to vigorously defend against the second complaint described above and
any other actions in which they are named as defendants. 
15. Segment reporting 
Public companies are required to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments
as required by FASB ASC Topic No280, Segment Reporting. We market our products in the United States and internationally through our direct sales force and our indirect distribution channels. During 2010, the business activities of CDIC were
integrated into the core business of SonoSite and we are currently in the process of integrating VisualSonics into our business. Our chief executive officer reviews financial information presented on a company wide basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic regions for purposes of allocating
resources and evaluating financial performance. Each of our geographic regions reports directly to our chief operating officer. We do not separately allocate operating expenses to geographic regions, nor do we allocate specific assets. Therefore,
geographic region information reported includes only revenues. Accordingly, we have a single operating and reporting segment. 
Geographic regions are determined by the shipping destination. Revenue by geographic region is as follows in thousands: Years ended December31 2011 2010 2009 United States 159,287 134,964 104,257 Europe, Africa and the Middle East 68,037 70,749 60,382 Latin America and Canada 29,302 21,573 20,849 Asia Pacific 49,348 48,076 41,901

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES a
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures As required by Rule 13a-15b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the
Exchange Act, our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated, as of December 31, 2011, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of
the Exchange Act. This evaluation included consideration of the processes and procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, as a result of the material weaknesses described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
Because of these material weaknesses in preparing our financial statements at December 31, 2011, we performed additional procedures to
ensure that our financial statements were fairly presented in all material respects in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. b Managements report on internal control over financial reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 as required by the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15c, using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of our evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting we identified the following material weaknesses and therefore concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2011:  Control activities related to modification of employment-related agreements. The Company lacked appropriate monitoring and review
controls for account reconciliations and transaction analyses over modifications to employment-related agreements, including stock-based awards. This material weakness resulted in misstatements in sales, general and administrative expenses and
additional paid in capital in the preliminary consolidated financial statements that were corrected prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements.  Control activities related to statement of cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits from stock-based awards. The Company lacked
appropriate monitoring and review controls by personnel with the appropriate technical knowledge over the account reconciliation of the excess tax benefit from exercise of stock-based awards presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
This material weakness resulted in a misstatement in net cash provided by used in operating activities and net cash provided by used in financing activities in the preliminary consolidated financial statements that was corrected prior to
issuance of the consolidated financial statements. As a result of these material weaknesses, there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued audit reports on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our consolidated financial statements. Their reports
may be found in Item8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K. c Changes in internal control over financial reporting
Other than the identification of material weaknesses described above, there have been no changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
d Managements Remediation Intentions 
Since signing the definitive agreement to be acquired by FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, we have devoted substantial time and resources to
the integration with Fujifilm and as part of that integration, management is evaluating the appropriate remediation activities to address the material weaknesses described above. Item1.

Section16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10%
of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all
Section16a forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written
representations from certain reporting persons that no forms were required for those persons, we believe that during the 2011 fiscal year, all filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were
complied with, except for a Form 4 for Dr.Martin and a Form 4 for Mr.Parzybok, a former Director, which were each filed three days late. Code of Conduct and Ethics We have adopted a code of conduct to guide our
officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and controller, in complying with the law and maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct. All of our employees and directors must
carry out their duties in accordance with the policies set forth in the code of conduct and with applicable laws and regulations. The code of conduct also sets forth our procedures for reporting possible wrongdoing to executive management and
establishes a confidential procedure for reporting to the audit committee. A copy of the code of conduct can be accessed on the Internet via our website at  Director Independence In accordance with the Merger Agreement, following
the consummation of the tender offer, on February 16, 2012, each of Carmen L. Diersen, Steven R. Goldstein, M.D., William G. Parzybok, Jr. and Robert G. Hauser, M.D. resigned from our Board. At the time of their resignations, Ms.Diersen was a
member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Dr.Goldstein, Mr.Parzybok and Dr.Hauser were members of the Compensation Committee, and Ms.Diersen was a member of the Audit Committee. Also on February 16, 2012,
the following designees of Purchaser were appointed to our Board to fill the vacancies created by the resignations of the above-listed directors: KouichiTamai, ToruTakahashi, RyutaroHosoda, NaohiroFujitani and
KenjiSukeno.  With the director
resignations and appointments on February 16, 2012, Messrs. Haack, Hochman and Martin are the only Directors who meet the independence standards as defined under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605b1; as a result, we are no longer in compliance
with the Board composition requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605b1. On February 17, 2012, we sent a letter to Nasdaq notifying Nasdaq of the foregoing facts. On February 22, 2012, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that, as a result of
the director resignations and appointments, we no longer comply with the majority independent board requirement for continued listing. On March 2, 2012, we sent a letter to Nasdaq notifying Nasdaq that a we are a controlled company as
such term is defined in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5615c1 and that b due to the controlled company status, we are seeking exemption with regard to the majority independent board requirements of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605b1. On March 7,
2012, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating that, given our controlled company status, we are deemed to be in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605b1. We expect that as a result of the Merger, our common stock will cease to be
traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Audit Committee The members of the audit committee in 2011 were Mr.Haack, Ms.Diersen and Dr.Martin; Ms.Diersen resigned on February16, 2012 in connection with the closing of the tender offer
