ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Valero Energy
Corporation Valero is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for
Valero. Valeros management evaluated the effectiveness of Valeros internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004. In its evaluation, Valeros management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management believes that as of December31, 2004, Valeros internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria. Valeros independent registered public accounting
firm has issued an attestation report on managements assessment of Valeros internal control over
financial reporting, which begins on page 57 of this report on Form 10-K. 55 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Valero Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for the year then ended. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the effectiveness of Valero
Energy Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March
11, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of, and the effective
operation of, internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP San Antonio, Texas
March11, 2005 56 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries We have audited
managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting for the year ended December31, 2004, that Valero
Energy Corporation and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment
and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. 57 Table of Contents We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the consolidated balance sheet
of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for the year then
ended, and our report dated March11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP San Antonio, Texas
March11, 2005 58 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Valero Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders equity, cash flows and comprehensive
income for each of the two years in the period then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries at
December31, 2003, and the consolidated results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the
two years in the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP San Antonio, Texas

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation As used in this report, the term Valero may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its
consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. Valero, an independent refining and
marketing company, owns and operates 15 refineries six in Texas, two each in California and
Louisiana, and one each in Colorado, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Aruba and Quebec, Canada with a
combined total throughput capacity as of December31, 2004 of approximately 25million barrels per
day. Valero markets refined products through an extensive bulk and rack marketing network and a
network of more than 4,700 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the United States and eastern
Canada under various brand names including primarily Valero, Diamond
Shamrock, Shamrock, Ultramar and Beacon.
Valeros operations are affected by   
company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance
turnarounds     
seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving
season and heating oil during the winter season; and     
industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the
effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of
refined products, industry supply capacity and competitor refinery maintenance turnarounds. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which
Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in 50% or less owned entities are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting see Note 9 for a discussion of the reporting change in 2003 for Valeros investment
in Valero L.P., a related party which was consolidated by Valero until March2003. Share and per share data except par value presented for all periods reflect the effect of a
two-for-one stock split, which was effected in the form of a common stock dividend distributed on
October7, 2004, as discussed in Note 15 under Common Stock Split. The term UDS Acquisition refers to the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation UDSinto
Valero effective December31, 2001. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates based on
currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates. Cash and Temporary Cash Investments Valeros temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments which generally
have a maturity of three months or less when acquired. Cash and temporary cash investments exclude
cash that is not available to Valero due to restrictions related to its use. Such amounts are
segregated in the consolidated balance sheets in restricted cash see Note 3. 65 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased
for processing and refined products are determined under the last-in, first-out LIFOmethod.
Valero uses the dollar-value LIFO method with any increments valued based on average purchase
prices during the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of
materials, supplies and convenience store merchandise are determined principally under the
weighted-average cost method. Property, Plant and Equipment Additions to property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and certain costs
allocable to construction and property purchases, are recorded at cost. The costs of minor property units or components of property units, net of salvage value, retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation under the composite method of
depreciation. Gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are
recorded in income and are reported in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated
statements of income. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related facilities primarily using the composite method of
depreciation. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using
the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the
related asset. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets
acquired less liabilities assumed. Intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance
excluding financial assets. Goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be
impaired. Valero uses October 1 of each year as its annual valuation date for the impairment test. Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets, net include the following   
refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance activities at Valeros refineries and which are deferred when incurred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the
next turnaround occurs     
fixed-bed catalyst costs, which represent the cost of catalyst that is changed out at
periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed
function and which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful life of the specific catalyst     
investments in certain 50% or less owned entities which are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting; and     
other noncurrent assets such as notes receivable, long-term investments, debt issuance
costs and various other costs. Valero evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that it may
not be able to recover the carrying amount of its investments or the investee is unable to sustain
an earnings capacity that 66 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is other than a
temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference between the
estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. After considering the
impairment of Valeros equity investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. discussed in Note
10, Valero believes that the carrying amounts of its equity method investments as of December31,
2004 are recoverable. Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, investments in 50%
or less owned entities, and deferred tax assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A long-lived
asset is not recoverable if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If
an asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying
amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value, with fair value determined based on
discounted estimated net cash flows. Valero believes that the carrying amounts of its long-lived
assets as of December31, 2004, are recoverable. Taxes Other than Income Taxes
Taxes other than income taxes includes primarily liabilities for ad valorem taxes, excise taxes
and payroll taxes. Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued Staff Position No.FAS
109-1, Application of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on
Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which
clarifies that the deduction for qualified production activities included in the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 the 2004 Act should be   
accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with Statement No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Asset Retirement Obligations
Effective January1, 2003, Valero adopted Statement No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for obligations
associated with
the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The
provisions of this statement apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal
operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. On January1, 2003, Valero recognized an asset retirement obligation of $300million, which is
included in other long-term liabilities, and an increase to net property, plant and equipment of
$258million. The implementation of Statement No143 resulted in a pre-tax loss of $42million,
which was included in the consolidated statements of income in other income expense, net versus
presentation as a cumulative effect of an accounting change due to immateriality. This asset
retirement obligation relates to the removal of underground storage tanks from Valeros retail
sites. Valero also determined at that time that an asset retirement obligation exists related to
its refinery assets. However, the fair value of the asset retirement obligation associated with
these refinery assets cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement dates are indeterminate;
therefore, no obligation was recorded for these refinery assets. In 2004, Valero voluntarily
decided to decommission and remediate certain waste water ponds at one of its refineries, thereby
requiring the closure of the ponds in accordance with applicable state law. At the time of this
decision, an asset retirement obligation of $155million was recorded in other long-term
liabilities. For the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, the changes in Valeros asset
retirement obligations were as follows in millions

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currencies of Valeros Canadian and Aruba operations are the Canadian dollar and the
Aruban florin, respectively. The translation into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet
accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense
accounts using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year. Adjustments resulting from
this translation are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Revenue Recognition
Revenues for products sold by both the refining and retail segments are recorded upon delivery of
the products to their customers, which is the point at which title to the products is transferred,
and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. Revenues for
services are recorded when the services have been provided. Revenues include the sales portion of certain buy/sell arrangements, which involve linked purchases
and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location, quality or grade
requirements. In some cases, to obtain crude oil of a specific grade and quantity for certain of
Valeros refineries, Valero must agree to sell crude oil of a different grade and quantity to its
supplier at another location. Valero generally does not have the specific crude oil to satisfy its
suppliers needs and therefore must purchase that crude oil from a third party. Valero sells the
crude oil acquired from the third party to its crude oil supplier and recognizes revenue on the
sale and cost of sales at that time. Currently, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITFis
addressing the accounting for linked purchase and sale arrangements in EITF Issue No04-13,
Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty. Valero will monitor
the progress of EITF Issue No04-13 to ensure that Valeros accounting for its linked purchases
and sales complies with the EITFs final consensus opinion. If the final consensus opinion were to
require presentation of such linked purchases and sales on a net basis, operating revenues would be
reduced and cost of sales would be reduced by an equal amount in Valeros consolidated statement of
income. Valero enters into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with its
customers by accessing refined products in markets where it does not operate its own refinery.
These refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no
revenues are recorded on these transactions. Product Shipping and Handling Costs
Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales in the
consolidated statements of income. Environmental Matters
Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time
period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as Valeros
own internal environmental policies. The environmental liabilities have not been reduced by
possible recoveries from third parties of amounts payable by Valero. 69 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Derivative Instruments
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
measured at their fair value. When Valero enters into a derivative instrument, it is designated as
a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge or a trading instrument. For Valeros
economic hedging relationships hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges and for
derivative instruments entered into by Valero for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is
recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized
currently in income. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a
fair value hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the
hedged risk, are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the
gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is reported
as a component of other comprehensive income and is recorded in income in the same period or
periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The remaining ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized currently
in income. Gains and losses on trading instruments are reflected on a net basis in the
consolidated statements of income. Financial Instruments
Valeros financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, restricted cash,
receivables, payables, debt, interest rate swaps, commodity contracts and foreign currency
contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying
amounts as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, except for certain long-term debt as
discussed in Note 12. The fair value of Valeros debt, interest rate swaps, commodity contracts
and foreign currency contracts was estimated based on year-end quoted market prices. Earnings per Common Share
Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Earnings per common share -
assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution of Valeros outstanding stock options and
performance awards granted to employees in connection with Valeros stock compensation plans, as
well as the 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock discussed in Note 15 and the PEPS Units prior
to the settlement of the related purchase contract obligations as discussed in Note 14. Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders
equity that, under United States generally accepted accounting principles, are excluded from net
income, such as foreign currency translation adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments and
gains and losses related to certain derivative instruments. Stock-Based Compensation
Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting set forth in APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations as currently permitted by Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. 70 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued The weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 was $1603, $1529 and $955 per stock option, respectively. The fair value of each
stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions

Because Valero accounts for its employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method,
compensation cost is not recognized in the consolidated statements of income for Valeros fixed
stock option plans as all options granted have an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for Valeros fixed stock
option plans been determined based on the grant-date fair value of awards consistent with the
alternative method set forth in Statement No123, Valeros net income applicable to common stock,
net income and earnings per common share, both with and without dilution, for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued For stock-based compensation awards other than fixed stock option awards, the after-tax
compensation cost reflected in net income for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$235million, $80million and $90million, respectively. See New Accounting Pronouncements below for a discussion of FASB Statement No123 revised
2004, which requires changes to the accounting for stock-based compensation beginning in 2005. Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits
In May2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No.FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which
provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 the Act for sponsors of postretirement health care plans. Staff
Position No.FAS 106-2 is effective for interim or annual financial statements for periods
beginning after June15, 2004, and supersedes the guidance of Staff Position No.FAS 106-1 on the
same subject, which allowed employers to defer accounting for the effects of the Act, including the
effect of a federal subsidy provided for in the Act. For sponsors of postretirement health care
plans that provide prescription drug benefits, Staff Position No.FAS 106-2 requires the sponsor to
determine whether those benefits are actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug
benefit, and, if so, to remeasure the postretirement benefit obligation, and the effect of such
remeasurement on the net periodic postretirement benefit cost, on a retroactive or prospective
basis at the election of the sponsor. Valero concluded that the enactment of the Act did not
constitute a significant event under Statement No106, and therefore, in lieu of remeasuring plan
obligations at the beginning of the third quarter, Valero incorporated the effects of the Act into
the regular measurement of plan obligations as of December31, 2004. See Note 22 for a further
discussion of the effect of the Act on Valero. New Accounting Pronouncements
FASB Statement No151
In November2004, the FASB issued Statement No151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
material and requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges. Statement No151
also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities. Statement No151 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2005, and is not expected to affect Valeros financial position or results
of operations. FASB Statement No153
In December2004, the FASB issued Statement No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. Statement No153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets, which
was previously provided by APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and
replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. Statement No.
153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement No153 is
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15,
2005. The adoption of Statement No153 is not expected to affect Valeros financial position or
results of operations. 72 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued FASB Statement No123 revised 2004
In December2004, the FASB issued a revision to Statement No123, which will become effective for
Valero on July1, 2005. The revised statement eliminates the alternative to use APB Opinion No.
25s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in Statement No123 as originally
issued and requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. Under the revised
Statement No123, Valero will transition to the fair-value-based method using a modified
prospective application. Under that transition method, compensation cost is recognized commencing
on the effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not
yet been rendered. As permitted by Statement No123, Valero currently accounts for share-based payments to employees
using Opinion No25s intrinsic value method, and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation
cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of the revised Statement No123s fair
value method will reduce Valeros results of operations, but it will not impact Valeros overall
financial position. The magnitude of the impact of adoption of the revised Statement No123
cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted
in the future. However, had Valero adopted the revised Statement No123 in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No123 as described in the
disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Stock-Based Compensation above. The revised Statement No123 also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
required under current literature. This requirement will reduce cash flows from operating
activities and increase cash flows from financing activities in periods after adoption. While
Valero cannot estimate the magnitude of such amounts in the future because they depend on, among
other things, when employees exercise stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized
in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $535million, $152million and $187million
for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Reclassifications
Certain previously reported amounts in the 2003 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. 2. ACQUISITIONS Aruba Acquisition
On March5, 2004, Valero completed the purchase of El Paso Corporations refinery located on the
island of Aruba in the Caribbean Sea Aruba Refinery, and related marine, bunkering and marketing
operations collectively, Aruba Acquisition. The purchase price for the Aruba Acquisition was
$465million plus approximately $168million for working capital. The working capital amount
excludes amounts related to certain refined product inventories owned by a third-party marketing
firm under an agreement in existence on the date of acquisition, pursuant to which Valero paid
$678million upon termination of the agreement on May4, 2004. The Aruba Acquisition, the purpose
of which was to strengthen Valeros geographic and product diversification, ensure a more secure
supply of intermediate feedstocks and blendstocks to certain of its other refineries, and increase
Valeros potential ability to take advantage of positive heavy sour crude oil fundamentals, was
funded with $200million in existing cash, approximately $27million in borrowings under Valeros
bank credit facilities and approximately $406million in net proceeds from the sale of 156million 73 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued shares of Valero common stock through a public offering discussed in Note 15 under Common Stock
Offerings. The amount paid to the third-party marketing firm described above was funded through
borrowings under Valeros bank credit facilities. The results of the Aruba Refinerys operations
are non-taxable in Aruba through December31, 2010. The purchase price has been preliminarily allocated among the assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed at the date of acquisition, based on their fair values as determined by an independent
appraisal and other evaluations. The final allocation of the purchase price is pending the
resolution of certain employee benefit plan matters. As of December31, 2004, the purchase price

St. Charles Acquisition
On July1, 2003, Valero completed the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery St. Charles
Acquisition from Orion Refining Corporation Orion. Total consideration for the purchase,
including various transaction costs incurred and the release of certain escrowed amounts discussed
below, was $5290million and included the issuance of 10million shares of mandatory convertible
preferred stock with a fair value of $22 per share. The purchase agreement required 844,000 shares
of the mandatory convertible preferred stock to be held in escrow pending the satisfaction of
certain conditions. The purchase agreement also provided for the assumption of certain
environmental and regulatory obligations as well as for potential earn-out payments up to an
aggregate of $175million as discussed in Note 23 under Contingent Earn-Out Agreements. As of
December31, 2003, the escrowed shares had been converted to cash, which was held in escrow and
reflected in restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet. Through December31, 2004,
Valero paid a total of $173million of the escrowed cash as prescribed by the purchase
agreement. The total potential earn-out payments of $175million discussed above were recognized in property,
plant and equipment with $50million recorded as a current liability in accrued expenses and
$125million recorded in other long-term liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation
since the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeded the cost of the
acquisition by an amount greater than the potential earn-out amount. During the second quarter of
2004, an independent appraisal was completed and the resulting final purchase price allocation for
the St. Charles Acquisition is summarized below in millions. The amounts reflected include the
accrual of the potential earn-out payments.

Valero maintains an accounts receivable sales facility with three third-party financial
institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $600million of eligible trade and credit card
receivables, which matures in October2005. Under this program, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Valero sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without
recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Valero remains responsible for servicing the
transferred receivables and pays certain fees related to its sale of receivables under the program.
Under the facility, Valero retains the residual interest in the designated pool of receivables.
This retained interest, which is included in receivables, net in the consolidated balance sheets,
is recorded at fair value. Due to ia short average collection cycle for such receivables, ii
Valeros collection experience history, and iiithe composition of the designated pool of trade
and credit card accounts receivable that are part of this program, the fair value of Valeros
retained interest approximates the total amount of the designated pool of accounts receivable
reduced by the amount of accounts receivable sold to the third-party financial institutions under
the program. The
costs incurred by Valero related to this facility, as well as a
similar facility assumed in the UDS Acquisition that was terminated in October 2002, which were included in other income
expense, net in the consolidated statements of income, were $117million, $62million and $68
million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Proceeds from
collections under these revolving accounts receivable sales facilities of $176billion, $124
billion and $85billion for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
reinvested in the programs by the third-party financial institutions. 76 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued However, the third-party
financial institutions interests in Valeros accounts receivable were never in excess of the sales
facility limits at any time under these programs. No accounts receivable included in these
programs were written off during 2004, 2003 or 2002. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, $14billion and $11billion, respectively, of Valeros accounts
receivable comprised the designated pools of trade and credit card accounts receivable included in
the program. Of these amounts, $600million was sold to the third-party financial institutions and

As of December31, 2004 and 2003, Valero had crude oil processing facilities, pipeline and terminal
facilities, and certain buildings and other equipment under capital leases totaling $80million
and $61million, respectively. Accumulated amortization on assets under capital leases was $08
million and $01million, respectively, as of December31, 2004 and 2003. On February28, 2003, Valero exercised its option under certain capital leases with El Paso
Corporation to purchase the Corpus Christi East Refinery and related refined product logistics
business, which had been operated by Valero since June1, 2001. In connection with the exercise of
the purchase option, the original purchase price for the assets was reduced by approximately $5
million to $2893million and the lease payment of approximately $5million due in the first
quarter of 2003 was avoided. No gain or loss was recorded on this transaction. Depreciation expense for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $4180million 3407million and $3163million, respectively. During 2004, net gains of $127million were
recorded on the disposition of various facilities, primarily resulting from a $151million gain on
the sale in December2004 of a pipeline grid system at Mont Belvieu and the tankage and idle MTBE
plant at Morgans Point for $27million. During 2003, net gains of $146million were recorded on
the disposition of various facilities, primarily resulting from the sale of certain retail stores
and Valeros home heating oil business in the northeastern United States and southern Ontario in
Canada. Valeros prior headquarters facility consisted of two buildings: One Valero Place OVPand Two
Valero Place TVP. In December2003, Valeros board of directors authorized the sale of OVP and
TVP for $273million. As a result, a $258million impairment charge was recognized in December
2003 to write down the carrying amount of OVP and TVP to their fair values less selling costs. The
impairment charge was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December31, 2003, and was included in the corporate
category for segment reporting purposes as shown in 78 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Note 21. On June30, 2004, Valero completed
the sale of both of its prior headquarters buildings for $273million, resulting in no significant
gain or loss in 2004. See Note 23 under Structured Lease Arrangements for a discussion of Valeros purchases during
2003 and 2004 of OVP, TVP, and other property, plant and equipment, which had been leased under
structured lease arrangements. 7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consisted of the following in millions

The settlements and adjustments related to tax contingencies reflected in the table above relate to
various income tax contingencies assumed in the UDS Acquisition, the effects of which were recorded
as purchase price adjustments. All of Valeros goodwill has been allocated among four reporting units that comprise the refining
segment. These reporting units are the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Northeast and West Coast
refining regions. Valero completed its annual test for impairment of goodwill as of October1,
2004, 2003 and 2002. Based on the results of the tests, there was no impairment of goodwill. 9. INVESTMENT IN AND TRANSACTIONS WITH VALERO L.P. As of December31, 2002, Valero owned 736% of Valero L.P., a limited partnership that owns and
operates crude oil and refined product pipeline, terminalling and storage tank assets. A wholly
owned subsidiary of Valero serves as the general partner of Valero L.P. As of December31, 2004
and 2003, Valero owned 457% of Valero L.P. Effective March18, 2003, Valero L.P. issued 5,750,000 common units to the public for aggregate
proceeds of $2113million and completed a private placement of $250million of debt. The net
proceeds, after issuance costs, of $2003million and $2473million, respectively, combined with
borrowings under Valero L.P.s credit facility and a contribution of $43million by Valero to
maintain its 2% general partner interest in Valero L.P., were used to fund a redemption of common
units from Valero and the acquisition of certain storage tanks and a pipeline system from Valero
discussed further below. Subsequent to Valero L.P.s equity and debt offerings, Valero L.P. redeemed 38million of its
common units from Valero for $1370million, including $29million representing the redemption of
a proportionate amount of Valeros general partner interest. The proceeds from the redemption are
reflected as a reduction to Valeros investment in Valero L.P. This redemption, combined with the
common unit issuance discussed above, reduced Valeros ownership of Valero L.P. to 495% as of
March18, 2003. At the same time, Valero L.P. amended its partnership agreement to reduce the
minimum vote required to remove the general partner from 80 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 66-2/3% to 58% of Valero L.P.s outstanding common and subordinated units, excluding the units
held by affiliates of Valero see discussion below for subsequent revisions to this minimum vote
which were effective on March11, 2004. As a result of the issuance and redemption of Valero L.P.
common units and the partnership agreement changes, effective March18, 2003, Valero ceased
consolidation of Valero L.P. and began using the equity method to account for its investment. Subsequent to the equity and debt offerings and the common unit redemption by Valero L.P. discussed
above, Valero contributed to Valero L.P. 58 crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks
located at Valeros Corpus Christi West, Texas City and Benicia Refineries for $200million.
Valero also contributed to Valero L.P. a refined products pipeline system for $150million. This
three-pipeline system connects Valeros Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West and Three Rivers
Refineries to markets in Houston, San Antonio and the Texas Rio Grande Valley. The contribution of
the storage tank assets and the pipeline system resulted in proceeds in excess of the carrying
amounts of the contributed assets of $1812million for Valero. Based upon Valeros continuing
equity ownership interest in Valero L.P., $897million of this excess was recorded as a reduction
to Valeros investment in Valero L.P. and is being amortized over the lives of the contributed
assets. The remaining $915million was deferred and recorded in other long-term liabilities and
is being amortized over the life of certain throughput, handling, terminalling and service
agreements discussed below, which is approximately 10years. No immediate gain was recognized as a result of the transactions discussed above. In connection with the contribution of the crude oil and intermediate feedstock storage tanks and
the three-pipeline system discussed above, Valero entered into certain throughput, handling,
terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P. In addition, Valero has other related-party
transactions with Valero L.P. for the use of Valero L.P.s pipelines, terminals and crude oil
storage tank facilities. Under various agreements, Valero has agreed to use Valero L.P.s
pipelines to transport crude oil shipped to and refined products shipped from certain of Valeros
refineries and to use Valero L.P.s refined product terminals for certain terminalling services.
In addition, Valero provides personnel to Valero L.P. to perform operating and maintenance services
with respect to certain assets for which Valero receives reimbursement from Valero L.P. Valero has
indemnified Valero L.P. for certain environmental liabilities related to assets sold by Valero to
Valero L.P. that were known on the date the assets were sold or are discovered within a specified
number of years after the assets were sold as a result of events occurring or conditions existing
prior to the date of sale. Beginning March18, 2003, the date Valero ceased consolidating Valero
L.P., Valero recognized in cost of sales both its costs related to the throughput, handling,
terminalling and service agreements with Valero L.P. and the receipt from Valero L.P. of payment
for operating and maintenance services provided by Valero to Valero L.P. Valero provides Valero L.P. with the corporate functions of legal, accounting, treasury,
engineering, information technology and other services for an annual fee Administrative Fee,
which was originally established at $52million. On March11, 2004, an amendment to the
Administrative Fee was approved. Under the amendment, which became effective on April1, 2004, the
new Administrative Fee is equal to the actual cost of Valeros corporate employees dedicated to
Valero L.P. matters plus an annual fee of $12million. The annual fee of $12million will be
increased by $12million per year through the expiration of the agreement in July2008. The
annual fee may also be adjusted to account for changed service levels due to Valero L.P.s
acquisition, sale or construction of assets. The Administrative Fee is reflected by Valero as a
reduction of general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December31, 2004 and
2003, the Administrative Fee charged to Valero L.P. was $97million and $52million,
respectively. 81 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued On April16, 2003, 581,000 additional common units of Valero L.P. were issued as a result of the
exercise by the underwriters of a portion of their overallotment option related to the March18,
2003 common unit issuance, reducing Valeros ownership interest from 495% to 482%. In August2003, Valero L.P. closed on a public offering of common units, selling 1,236,250 common
units to the public at $4115 per unit, before underwriters discount of $185 per unit. Net
proceeds from this common unit offering, which further reduced Valeros ownership interest in
Valero L.P. to slightly below 46%, were partially used by Valero L.P. to fund its purchase from
Valero of the Southlake refined products pipeline for $299million. Valeros gain on this sale of
$24million was deferred and is being recognized over future periods, with $12million recorded
as a reduction to Valeros investment in Valero L.P. and $12million recorded as a deferred credit
in other long-term liabilities. Effective March11, 2004, Valero L.P. amended its partnership agreement as follows   
capped the general partners distribution, including incentive distributions, at 25% for
all distributions in excess of $066 per unit per quarter and     
reduced the minimum vote required to remove the general partner from 58% to a simple
majority of Valero L.P.s outstanding common and subordinated units, excluding the units
held by affiliates of Valero. Proposed Merger
On November1, 2004, Valero L.P. announced a proposed merger valued at approximately $28billion
in which Valero L.P. will acquire Kaneb Services LLC Kaneb Services and Kaneb Pipe Line Partners,
L.P. Kaneb Partners. The boards of directors of the respective entities approved the terms
of the proposed transaction, and on March11, 2005, the proposed transaction was approved by
the shareholders of Kaneb Services and the unitholders of both Kaneb Partners and Valero L.P. The
completion of the proposed merger is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Valero expects to contribute approximately $28million to Valero L.P. to maintain Valeros 2%
general partner interest in Valero L.P., and Valeros total ownership interest in Valero L.P.,
including the 2% general partner interest, is anticipated to be reduced to approximately 23% as a
result of the merger. 82 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Highway Oil Pipeline Project. Enterprise Product Partners, L.P. and affiliates Enterprise have
since acquired GulfTerras interests in the project. The project involves the construction and
operation of a 390-mile crude oil pipeline that is expected to deliver up to 500,000 barrels per
day from the Gulf of Mexico to the major refining areas of Port Arthur and Texas City, Texas.
Enterprise will operate the pipeline, which began operations during the first quarter of 2005.
Valeros investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project is accounted for using the equity
method and is included in deferred charges and other assets, net in the consolidated balance
sheet. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, Valeros investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline
Project totaled $1404million and $1061million, respectively. Investment in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P.
As of December31, 2004, Valero and Hoechst Celanese Chemical Group, Inc. Celanese each held a
50% ownership interest in Clear Lake Methanol Partners, L.P. Clear Lake, a limited partnership
formed in 1994 for the purpose of refurbishing and operating Celaneses methanol production
facility in Clear Lake, Texas. Under the terms of the limited partnership arrangement, Valero and
Celanese historically have each provided 50% of the natural gas processed at the facility and have
taken 50% of the methanol produced by the facility. In December2004, Valero secured a more
economical supply of methanol from other sources and made the 84 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued decision to discontinue its
participation in the Clear Lake joint venture beginning in the second half of 2005. As a result,
an impairment charge of $572million was recognized in December2004 to write off the carrying
amount of Valeros equity investment in Clear Lake. The impairment charge was reflected in other
income expense, net in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December31,
2004. This equity investment was
previously included in the refining reporting segment as shown in Note 21. As of December31, 2004, no additional costs have been accrued by Valero in connection
with the termination of its participation in the Clear Lake joint venture. As of December31, 2004
and 2003, Valeros investment in the Clear Lake joint venture totaled zero and $606million,
respectively. Tesoro Notes Receivable
In conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, the Federal Trade Commission approved a consent decree
requiring the divestiture of certain UDS assets. Those assets and their related operations were
referred to as the Golden Eagle Business and included the 168,000 barrel-per-day Golden Eagle
Refinery, the related wholesale marketing business and branded retail stores located in northern
California. In May2002, the Golden Eagle Business was sold to Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company Tesoro.
Valero received cash proceeds of $925million and two ten-year junior subordinated notes with face
amounts totaling $150million as follows   
a $100million note, due July17, 2012, which was non-interest bearing for the first
five years and carried a 75% interest rate for the remaining five-year period, and     
a $50million note, due July17, 2012, which bore no interest during the first year and
carried interest at approximately 75% for years two through ten. The two notes were recorded with an initial fair value of $589million using a discount rate of
16%, which represented Valeros best estimate of the fair value of the notes at the closing date of
the sale. The discount was being amortized over the life of the notes and was reported as interest
income in other income expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. The notes
receivable were included in Valeros consolidated balance sheet in deferred charges and other
assets, net. In November2003, the Tesoro notes were sold to various investors. Valero received net proceeds of
$896million. The net book value of the notes at the time of sale was $726million, resulting in
a gain of $170million, which was reported in other income expense, net in the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December31, 2003. 85 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

in derivative liabilities is related to an increase in unrealized losses on cash flow hedge
derivative activity primarily related to forward sales of distillates
and associated crude oil purchases. Accrued expenses for
contingent earn-out payments resulted from the purchase price allocation for the St. Charles
Acquisition as discussed in Notes 2 and 23. Included in other accrued expenses are accruals for capital expenditures, legal and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Revolving Bank Credit Facilities
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, Valero had two revolving bank credit facilities which provide for
commitments of $750million for a five-year term and $750million for a three-year term. Subject
to the commitment amounts and terms, Valeros two revolving bank credit facilities provide for
borrowings to be made at various amounts, maturities and interest rates, at the option of Valero.
Valero will also be charged various fees and expenses in connection with these facilities,
including facility fees and various letter of credit fees. The interest rates and fees under these
facilities are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to Valeros long-term
debt. These facilities include certain covenants, including a coverage ratio and a
debt-to-capitalization ratio. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, letters of credit outstanding
under these committed facilities totaled $2789million and $2450million, respectively. In addition to Valeros two $750million revolving bank credit facilities, a Canadian subsidiary of
Valero has a committed revolving credit facility under which it may borrow and obtain letters of
credit up to Cdn. $115million. As of December31, 2004 and
2003, Valero had Cdn. $82million and Cdn. $78million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under the Canadian revolving credit
facility. Valero also has various uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities. As of December31, 2004 and
2003, Valero had no borrowings outstanding under its uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities;
however, there were $2181million and $2561million, respectively, of letters of credit
outstanding under such facilities. Valeros uncommitted credit facilities have no commitment or

On June4, 2003, Valero issued $300million of 475% notes due June15, 2013 under its prior shelf
registration statement. Interest is payable semi-annually. The notes are unsecured and are
redeemable, in whole or in part, at Valeros option. The net proceeds from this offering of $2968
million were used to redeem $200million of TOPrS discussed below in Note 14 and $100million of 8%
debentures due 2023. A premium of $38million was paid and expensed in the second quarter of 2003
as a result of the early redemption of the 8% debentures. In August2003, $136million of 6797% notes became outstanding as a result of the cash settlement
of certain purchase contract obligations associated with Valeros PEPS Units. See Note 14 below
for a further discussion of the PEPS Units and the resulting $136million of outstanding notes. On March22, 2004, Valero issued $200million of 350% Senior Notes due April1, 2009 and $200
million of 475% Senior Notes due April1, 2014 under its prior shelf registration statement
together, the Notes. Interest is payable on the Notes on April 1 and October 1 of each year
beginning October1, 2004. The Notes are unsecured and are redeemable, in whole or in part, at
Valeros option. The net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under Valeros
revolving bank credit facilities. On March25, 2004, Valero entered into additional interest rate swap contracts with a total
notional amount of $200million to hedge against changes in interest rates. These interest rate
swap contracts have the effect of converting the $200million of 475% Senior Notes from fixed rate
to floating rate debt. On March29, 2004, Valero borrowed $200million under a five-year term loan, with a maturity date
of March31, 2009 and bearing interest based on Valeros debt rating. Principal payments were
scheduled to 88 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued begin March2007 with a $500million principal payment due at that time and
semi-annual payments of $375million due thereafter until maturity. Valero used the net proceeds
from this borrowing to repay borrowings under its revolving bank credit facilities. In December
2004, Valero repaid the entire outstanding balance of the term loan. In December2004, Valero repurchased $405million of the 7375% notes due in March2006 and $279
million of the 6125% notes due in April2007. A premium of $37million was paid and expensed in
the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of the early redemption of these notes. During January
2005, Valero repurchased $395million of its 7375% notes due in 2006 and $421million of its
6125% notes due in 2007 at a premium of $40million. In addition, during February2005, Valero
made a scheduled debt repayment of $460million related to its 744% medium-term notes. Valeros revolving bank credit facilities and other long-term debt arrangements contain various
customary restrictive covenants, including cross-default and cross-acceleration clauses. The aggregate stated maturities of long-term debt as of December31, 2004 were as follows in

Environmental liabilities reflect the long-term portion of Valeros estimated remediation costs for
environmental matters as discussed in Note 24. The liability for
contingent earn-out payments resulted from the purchase price allocation for the St. Charles
Acquisition as discussed in Note 2. Deferred gain reflects the
unamortized balance of a portion of the proceeds in excess of the carrying amount of assets
contributed and sold by Valero to Valero L.P. as discussed in Note 9. Insurance liabilities reflect reserves established by Valeros two captive insurance
subsidiaries, self-insured liabilities and obligations for losses related to Valeros participation
in certain mutual insurance companies. See Note 1 under Asset
Retirement Obligations for a discussion of the liability related to asset retirement obligations
reflected in the table above. Tax liabilities other than income taxes include long-term
liabilities for franchise taxes and excise taxes as well as interest accrued on all tax-related
liabilities, including income taxes. Unfavorable lease obligations reflect the fair value of liabilities assumed in connection with the
UDS Acquisition related to lease agreements for retail facilities and vessel charters. In June
2003, Valero purchased certain convenience stores which were subject to structured lease
arrangements for approximately $215million. Approximately $88million of the payment was recorded
as a reduction of the unfavorable lease obligation that was recorded in connection with the UDS
Acquisition. Included in other are liabilities for various matters including legal and regulatory liabilities,
derivative obligations and various contractual obligations. 14. COMPANY-OBLIGATED PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS TOPrS
In conjunction with the UDS Acquisition, Valero assumed $200million of 832% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities TOPrS 8,000,000 units at $2500 per unit, which were issued by UDS Capital
I the Trust. Distributions on the TOPrS were cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears if and
when the Trust had funds 90 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued available for distribution. In June2003, the TOPrS were redeemed with
proceeds from the issuance of $300million of 475% notes as described in Note 12. PEPS Units
In June2000, Valero issued $1725million of Premium Equity Participating Securities PEPS Units
under a shelf registration statement 6,900,000 units at $2500 per unit. Upon issuance, each
PEPS Unit consisted of a trust preferred security issued by VEC Trust I and an associated purchase
contract obligating the holder of the PEPS Unit to purchase on August18, 2003 a number of shares
of common stock from Valero for $25 per purchase contract. The number of shares of common stock
issuable for each purchase contract was to be determined at a price based on the average price of
Valero common stock for the relevant 20-day trading period. Under the original agreement, holders
of PEPS Units could settle their purchase contracts by paying cash to Valero or by remarketing
their pledged trust preferred securities and using the proceeds from the remarketing to settle the
purchase contracts. In accordance with the original agreement, the distribution rate on the trust
preferred securities, which was 775% on date of issuance, was to be reset on August18, 2003 based
on the price for which the trust preferred securities were remarketed. In accordance with the
terms of the trust, on August12, 2003, Valero dissolved the trust and substituted its senior
deferrable notes for the trust preferred securities. As a result, Valeros senior deferrable notes
were scheduled to be remarketed in place of the trust preferred securities, with the interest rate
on the senior deferrable notes to be reset on August18, 2003 based upon the price for which the
senior deferrable notes were remarketed. The remarketing of the senior deferrable notes was scheduled for August13, 2003. The holders of
approximately 636million PEPS Units opted to settle their purchase contract obligations by
remarketing the senior deferrable notes totaling $1589million, while holders of approximately
054million PEPS Units elected to settle their purchase contract obligations with cash and retain
their senior deferrable notes totaling $136million in lieu of participating in the remarketing.
On August13, Valero received notice from the remarketing agent that a failed remarketing as
defined in the prospectus supplement related to the PEPS Units of the senior deferrable notes was
deemed to have occurred. The $1589million of senior deferrable notes surrendered to Valero to
satisfy the holders purchase contract obligations were retained by Valero in full satisfaction of
the holders obligations under the purchase contracts and were canceled on August18, 2003. The
remaining $136million of senior deferrable notes mature on August18, 2005 and bear an interest
rate of 6797%. Valero, in turn, issued 99million shares of its common stock at a price of
$17475 per share in settlement of the 69million purchase contracts. Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon settlement of the purchase contract
obligations, the number of shares of Valero common stock included in the calculation of earnings
per common share assuming dilution for each reporting period was calculated using the treasury
stock method. For this purpose, the number of shares to be issued pursuant to the purchase
contract obligations was based on the applicable conversion formula in the PEPS Unit agreement,
using the average closing price of Valeros common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on
the third trading day prior to the end of the reporting period. 91 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

2% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock
In connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery from Orion, effective July1, 2003,
Valero issued 10million shares of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock. The mandatory
convertible preferred stock had a fair value of $22 per share, or an aggregate of $220million. Of
this amount, $213million was attributable to beneficial conversion terms of the preferred stock
and was recorded in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets, with the
remaining $1987million reflected as preferred stock. The resulting $213million preferred
stock discount is being amortized as additional preferred stock dividends through June30, 2006,
the day before the mandatory conversion of the preferred stock as discussed below. The mandatory convertible preferred stock will automatically convert to Valero common stock on July
1, 2006, unless converted sooner. Valero pays annual dividends of $050 for each share of
convertible preferred stock when and if declared by its board of directors. Dividends are paid
quarterly, provided that dividends will not accrue or be payable with respect to a particular
calendar quarter if Valero does not declare a dividend on its common stock during that calendar
quarter. The convertible preferred stock ranks with respect to dividend rights and rights upon
Valeros liquidation, winding-up or dissolution as follows   
i
senior to all common stock and to all other capital stock of Valero issued in the
future that ranks junior to the convertible preferred stock     
ii
on a parity with any of Valeros capital stock issued in the future the terms of which
expressly provide that it will rank on a parity with the convertible preferred stock; and 92 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   
iii
junior to all of Valeros capital stock the terms of which expressly provide that such
capital stock will rank senior to the convertible preferred stock. The holders of the convertible preferred stock will generally be entitled to vote with Valero
common stock and not as a separate class and have a number of votes equal to the mandatory
conversion ratio that would be in effect if the mandatory conversion date was the record date of
such vote. The affirmative vote of holders of 66-2/3% of the convertible preferred stock is
necessary to make any change to the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws that would adversely
affect any power, preference or special right of the convertible preferred stock. Upon automatic conversion of the convertible preferred stock on July1, 2006, the number of shares
of common stock to be received for each share of convertible preferred stock shall be based on the applicable market value of Valeros
common stock, which is two times the
average closing price of Valeros common stock over the 20-day
trading period ending on the second
trading day prior to July1, 2006, as follows   
1338 shares if the applicable market value is less than or
equal to $3737     
a fractional number of shares having a value of $25 if the
applicable market value is
between $3737 and $5045; or     
0991 shares if the applicable market value is greater than
$5045. Each share of convertible preferred stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
before July1, 2006 into 0991 shares of Valero common stock.
The number of shares to be received upon conversion of a share of the
convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of certain events. During the third quarter of 2003,
Valero filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC
to register the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon the
conversion of the convertible preferred stock. The registration statement was declared effective
on October16, 2003. During January and February of 2005, 927,512 shares of the preferred stock
were converted into 919,162 shares of Valero common stock. Prior to the issuance of shares of Valero common stock upon conversion of the convertible preferred
stock, the number of shares of Valero common stock included in the calculation of earnings per
common share assuming dilution for each reporting period will be based on the above conversion
formula using the average closing price of Valeros common stock over the 20-day trading period
ending on the second trading day prior to the end of the reporting period. Common Stock Offerings
On March28, 2003, Valero sold in a public offering 126million shares of its common stock at a
price of $20125 per share and received net proceeds of $2503million. These shares were issued
under Valeros prior shelf registration statement. The proceeds were used for repayment of
borrowings under Valeros revolving bank credit facilities. On February5, 2004, Valero sold in a public offering 156million shares of its common stock,
which included 20million shares related to an overallotment option exercised by the underwriter,
at a price of $2663 per share and received proceeds, net of underwriters discount, commissions
and other issuance costs, of
$4058million. These shares were issued under Valeros prior shelf registration statement to
partially fund the Aruba Acquisition discussed in Note 2. 93 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Common Stock Split
On July15, 2004, Valeros board of directors approved a two-for-one split of Valeros common stock
that was effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on October
7, 2004 to stockholders of record on September23, 2004. In connection with the stock split,
Valeros shareholders approved on September13, 2004, an amendment to Valeros certificate of
incorporation to increase the number of authorized common shares from 300million to 600million. All share and per share data except par value have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the
stock split for all periods presented. In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable
upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, the exercise of outstanding stock
options and the vesting of other stock awards, as well as the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under Valeros various employee benefit plans, were proportionately increased
in accordance with the terms of those respective agreements and plans. Common Stock Purchases
Valero purchases shares of its common stock in open market transactions to meet its obligations
under employee benefit plans. Valero also purchases shares of its common stock from its employees
and non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of
restricted stock and other stock compensation transactions. During the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, Valero purchased 97million, 34million and 21million shares of its common
stock at a cost of $3174million, $732million and $455million, respectively. Cash Dividends
On February3, 2005, Valeros board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of
$008 per common share payable March16, 2005 to holders of record at the close of business on
February16, 2005. Also on February3, 2005, Valeros board of directors declared a dividend on the mandatory
convertible preferred stock of $0125 per share payable on March31, 2005 to holders of record on

which are reflected separately in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the effect
of certain noncash investing and financing activities discussed below; and     
certain differences between consolidated balance sheet changes and consolidated
statement of cash flow changes reflected above result from translating foreign currency
denominated amounts at different exchange rates. Noncash investing activities for the year ended December31, 2004 included various adjustments to

Valero is exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product
prices, as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in its refining operations. To
reduce the impact of this price volatility, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments swaps,
futures and options to manage its exposure to   
changes in the fair value of a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product
inventories and a portion of its unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these
inventories fair value hedges     
changes in cash flows of certain forecasted transactions such
as forecasted feedstock and product purchases, natural gas purchases and refined product sales cash flow hedges; and     
price volatility on a portion of its refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and on certain
forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product
sales and natural gas purchases that are not designated as either fair
value or cash flow hedges economic hedges. In addition, Valero uses derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on its
fundamental and technical analysis of market conditions. Interest Rate Risk
Valero is exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to certain of its long-term
debt obligations. Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage Valeros fixed to floating
interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt. 97 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Foreign Currency Risk
Valero is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to its Canadian operations.
To manage its exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, Valero uses foreign currency exchange
and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Current Period Disclosures

The above amounts were included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. No
component of the derivative instruments gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. No amounts were recognized in income for hedged firm commitments that no longer
qualify as fair value hedges. For cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income in the consolidated balance sheets will be reclassified into income when the forecasted
transactions affect income. During the year ended December31, 2004, Valero recognized in
accumulated other comprehensive income unrealized after-tax losses of $1673million on certain
cash flow hedges, primarily related to forward sales of distillates and associated crude oil
purchases, with $487million of cumulative after-tax losses on cash flow hedges remaining in
accumulated other comprehensive income as of December31, 2004. Valero expects that all of these
losses will be reclassified into income in 2005 as a result of hedged transactions that are
forecasted to occur. The amount ultimately realized in income, however, will differ as commodity
prices change. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were no amounts
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income as a result of the
discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting. Market and Credit Risk
Valeros price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments
into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in
market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. Valero closely monitors and manages its
exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by its board of
directors. Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with Valeros
stated risk management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact
Valeros overall exposure to credit risk, in that these customers may be similarly affected by
changes in economic or other conditions. Valero believes that its counterparties will be able to
satisfy their obligations under their price risk management contracts with Valero. 19. PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS Each outstanding share of Valeros common stock is accompanied by one preferred share purchase

Acquiring Person having beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valeros outstanding common
stock the earlier of these two options being called the Rights Separation Date, or     
the earlier redemption or expiration of the Rights. The Rights are not exercisable until the Rights Separation Date. At any time prior to the
acquisition by an Acquiring Person of beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valeros outstanding
common stock, Valeros board of directors may redeem the Rights at a price of $001 per Right. The
Rights will expire on June30, 2007, unless the Rights are extended or are earlier redeemed or
exchanged by Valero. If after the Rights Separation Date, Valero is acquired in a merger or other business combination
transaction, or if 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power is sold, each holder of
a Right will have the right to receive, upon the exercise of the Right at its then current exercise
price, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of the
transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In the event
that any Acquiring Person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of Valeros outstanding
common stock, each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person
which will thereafter be void, will thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise that
number of shares of common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the
Right. At any time after an Acquiring Person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valeros
outstanding common stock and prior to the acquisition by the Acquiring Person of 50% or more of
Valeros outstanding common stock, Valeros board of directors may exchange the Right other than
Rights owned by the Acquiring Person which have become void, at an exchange ratio of one share of
common stock, or 005 of a share of Junior Preferred Stock, per Right subject to
adjustment. Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no rights as a stockholder of Valero including,
without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. The Rights may have certain
anti-takeover effects. The Rights will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that
attempts to acquire Valero on terms not approved by Valeros board of directors, except pursuant to
an offer conditioned on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights should not
interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by Valeros board of directors
since the Rights may be redeemed by Valero prior to the time that an Acquiring Person has acquired
beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Valeros outstanding common stock. 99 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Valero has recorded a valuation allowance as of December31, 2004 and 2003, due to uncertainties
related to its ability to utilize some of its deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of
certain state net operating losses, state tax credits and foreign tax credits, before they expire.
The valuation allowance is based on Valeros estimates of taxable income in the various
jurisdictions in which it operates and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be
recoverable. The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December31, 2004 is
dependent upon Valeros ability to generate future taxable income in the United States, Canada
and Aruba. Subsequently recognized tax benefits related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as
of December31, 2004 will be allocated as follows in millions

U.S. federal deferred income taxes and Canadian withholding taxes have not been provided for on the
undistributed earnings of Valeros Canadian and Aruban subsidiaries based on the determination that
those earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. As of December31, 2004, the cumulative
undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately $10billion. If those earnings
were not considered indefinitely reinvested, U.S. federal deferred income taxes and Canadian
withholding taxes would have been recorded after consideration of
foreign tax credits. However, it is not practicable to estimate the
amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income
if distributed. Valeros separate tax years through 1999 and UDSs tax years through 1994 and for 1998 and 1999 are
closed to adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service. UDSs separate tax years 1995 through 1997,
2000 and 2001 are currently under examination. Valeros separate tax years 2000 and 2001 are
currently under examination. In addition, Valeros tax years 2002 and 2003 are currently under
examination. Valero believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION Valero has two reportable segments, refining and retail. Valeros refining segment includes
refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation
operations. The retail segment includes company-operated convenience stores, Canadian
dealers/jobbers and truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities and home heating oil operations.
Operations that are not included in either of the two reportable segments are included in the
corporate category. The reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.
They are managed separately as each business requires unique technology and marketing strategies.
Performance is evaluated based on operating income. Intersegment sales are generally derived from
transactions made at prevailing market rates. 102 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition, some of which are subject to collective bargaining
agreements. The Qualified Plans cover substantially all employees in the United States and
generally provide eligible employees with retirement income based on years of service and
compensation during specific periods. Effective March 1 and April1, 2002, certain classes of
former UDS retail employees ceased accruing benefits under Valeros qualified pension plan. 104 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Valero also has various nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans Supplemental Plans,
including plans assumed in the UDS Acquisition, which provide additional pension benefits to
executive officers and certain other employees. The Supplemental Plans and the Qualified Plans are
collectively referred to as the Pension Plans. Valero also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees,
referred to as other postretirement benefits. Substantially all of Valeros employees may become
eligible for these benefits if, while still working for Valero, they either reach normal retirement
age or take early retirement. Valero offers health care benefits through a self-insured plan and a
health maintenance organization while life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance
company. Valero funds its postretirement benefits other than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Individuals who became Valero employees as a result of an acquisition by Valero became eligible for
other postretirement benefits under Valeros plan as determined by terms of the relevant
acquisition agreement. As discussed in Note 1 under Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, the FASB has provided
guidance on accounting for the effects of the Act for sponsors of postretirement health care plans.
Valero incorporated the effects of the Act into the regular measurement of plan obligations as of
December31, 2004, which resulted in a $154million reduction in the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation as of December31, 2004 and a $18million reduction in the estimated net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2005. Valero uses December31 as the measurement date for its Pension Plans and other postretirement
benefit plans. 105 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Equity securities in the Qualified Plans include Valero common stock in the amounts of
approximately $94million 16% of total Qualified Plan assets and $48million 10% of total
Qualified Plan assets as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The investment policies and strategies for the assets of Valeros Qualified Plans incorporate a
well-diversified approach which is expected to earn long-term returns from capital appreciation and
a growing stream of current income. This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and
the market value of the Qualified Plans assets may fluctuate from year to year. Risk tolerance is
determined based on Valeros financial ability to withstand risk within the investment program and
the willingness to accept return volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk
parameters, the Qualified Plans mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity and
fixed-income investments. Equity investments include international stocks and a blend of domestic
growth and value stocks of various sizes of capitalization. The aggregate asset allocation is
reviewed on an annual basis. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Qualified Plans is estimated
using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the
assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient. Three methods are used to derive
the long-term expected returns for each asset class. Since each method has distinct advantages and
disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted average of the methods results is used. Although Valero has no minimum required contributions to its Qualified Plans during 2005 under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Valero expects to contribute $60million to its Qualified
Plans during 2005. 107 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Valero is the sponsor of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan, which is a qualified employee
profit-sharing plan. Participation in the Thrift Plan is voluntary and is open to Valero employees
who become eligible to participate upon the completion of one month of continuous service. This
service may include prior employment with other companies acquired by Valero. Thrift Plan participants can make basic contributions from 2% up to 8% of their total annual
compensation, which includes overtime and cash bonuses. In addition, participants who make a basic
contribution of 8% can also make a supplemental contribution of up to 22% of their total annual
compensation. During 2002 and 2003,
the maximum match by Valero was 75% of each participants basic contributions up to 8% based on the
participants total annual compensation, with the exception of the period from January1, 2002
through February1, 2002 during which employer contributions were equal to 100% of employee
contributions up to 8%. Effective December31, 2003, the Thrift Plan was amended to exclude cash
bonuses payable for periods after December31, 2002, from the participants total annual
compensation for purposes of calculating Valeros matching contribution. Valeros contributions to the Thrift Plan for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$266million, $240million and $209million, respectively. 109 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Valero Savings Plan
In connection with the UDS Acquisition, Valero became the plan sponsor of the Valero Savings Plan
Savings Plan, formerly the UDS 401k Retirement Savings Plan. The Savings Plan is a defined
contribution plan that previously covered all eligible employees of UDS. Under the Savings Plan,
participants can contribute from 1% to 30% of their compensation. Valero contributes $060 for
every $100 of the participants contribution up to 6% of compensation. Effective January1, 2002,
the company matching contributions for certain non-store employees of UDS was changed to 75% of up
to 8% of employee contributions. Effective April1, 2002, certain non-store employees of UDS were
no longer eligible to participate in the Savings Plan, but became eligible to participate in the
Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan. Valeros contributions to the Savings Plan for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $47million, $44million and $76million, respectively. Stock Compensation Plans
Valero has various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans, which are summarized as
follows   
The 2001 Executive Stock Incentive Plan the ESIP authorizes the grant of various stock
and stock-related awards to executive officers and other key employees. Awards available
under the ESIP include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that
vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock which
vests over a period determined by Valeros compensation committee. As of December31,
2004, a total of 1,733,592 shares of Valero common stock remained available to be awarded
under the ESIP.     
Valero formerly maintained its Executive Incentive Bonus Plan to provide bonus
compensation to key employees based on individual contributions to company profitability.
Bonuses were payable either in cash, Valero common stock, or both. Effective with the
issuance of certain new rules by the New York Stock Exchange in June2003 which prohibit
the issuance of shares under plans that are not approved by a companys shareholders, no
additional shares of Valero common stock have been or will be issued under this plan.     
A non-employee director stock option plan provides non-employee directors of Valero
automatic grants of stock options to purchase Valeros common stock upon their election to
Valeros board of directors and annual grants of stock options upon their continued service
on the board. As of December31, 2004, a total of 165,000 shares of Valero common stock
remained available for issuance under this plan.     
A restricted stock plan for non-employee directors provides non-employee directors, upon
their election to the board of directors, a grant of Valeros common stock valued at
$45,000 that vests in three equal annual installments, with similar grants issued after
full vesting of prior grants. As of December31,
2004, a total of 144,032 shares of Valero common stock remained available to be awarded
under this plan.     
The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of various stock and
stock-related awards to employees and prospective employees. Awards include options to
purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an
objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock which vests
over a period determined by Valeros compensation committee. As of December31, 2004, a
total of 4,260,044 shares of Valero common stock remained available to be awarded under
this plan.     
Valero GP, LLCs 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, 2002 Unit Option Plan and 2003 Employee
Unit Incentive Plan provide for grants of restricted common units of Valero L.P. and/or
options to purchase common units of Valero L.P. These restricted common unit and option
awards vest over a period 110 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

related equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal
vessels, dock facilities and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation,
production and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Certain leases for production equipment and feedstock and refined product storage facilities
provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in excess
of a base amount. Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which
vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on
usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage.
Leases for convenience stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on
sales volumes. In most cases, Valero expects that in the normal course of business, its leases
will be renewed or replaced by other leases. As of December31, 2004, Valeros future minimum rental payments and minimum rentals to be received
under subleases for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one
year were as reflected in the following table in millions.

113 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Structured Lease Arrangements
During 2002, 2003 and the early part of 2004, Valero had various long-term operating lease
commitments that were funded through structured lease arrangements with non-consolidated third
party entities the lessors. These leases were for land, office facilities and equipment, retail
facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and
equipment used in the production of refined products. The lessors constructed or purchased the
related assets and then leased them to Valero. The assets held by these lessors were funded
through equity contributions of the lessors ranging from 3% to 5% of the fair market value of the
asset and borrowings from various financial institutions. Neither Valero, its affiliates nor any
related parties held any interest in these lessors. For each lease, Valero had the option to
purchase the leased assets at any time during the lease term for a price that approximated fair
value. In the second quarter of 2003, Valero purchased TVP and certain convenience stores, which were
subject to structured lease arrangements, for approximately $23million and $215million,
respectively. Of the payment for the convenience stores, approximately $127million was recorded
as an increase to property, plant and equipment and approximately $88million reduced an
unfavorable lease obligation that was recorded in conjunction with the UDS Acquisition. In
December2003, Valero purchased OVP for $34million. In March2004, Valero exercised its option to purchase the leased properties under each of its four
remaining structured lease arrangements, and these leased properties, which totaled $5671million,
were purchased through borrowings under Valeros existing bank credit facilities. Other Commitments
Valero has various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply
arrangements such as hydrogen supply arrangements, crude oil and other feedstock supply
arrangements and various throughput and terminalling agreements. Valero enters into these
contracts to ensure an adequate supply of utilities, feedstock and storage to operate its
refineries. Many of Valeros purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based
on market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on Valeros usage requirements. The purchase obligations
reflected below include both short-term and long-term obligations as of December31, 2004, and are
based on minimum quantities to be purchased and/or estimated prices to be paid under the agreements
based on current market conditions. These purchase obligations are not reflected in the
consolidated balance sheets. Estimated future annual purchase obligations as of December31, 2004 were as follows in millions

Accounts Receivable Sales Facility
As discussed in Note 4, as of December31, 2004, Valero had an accounts receivable sales facility
with three third-party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $600million of
eligible trade and credit card 114 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued receivables, which matures in October2005. As of December31,
2004, the amount of eligible receivables sold to
the third-party financial institutions was $600million. Guarantees
In connection with the sale of the Golden Eagle Business in 2002, Valero guaranteed certain lease
payment obligations related to a lease assumed by Tesoro, which totaled approximately $34million
as of December31, 2004. This lease expires in 2010. Valero was not required to, and did not,
make any payments under this guarantee for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Contingent Earn-Out Agreements
In connection with Valeros acquisitions of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the Paulsboro
Refinery in 1998 and Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997, the sellers are entitled to receive payments in
any of the seven, five and ten years, respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average
refining margins during any of those years exceed a specified level. The following table

No future earn-out payments related to the acquisition of the Paulsboro Refinery will be due as the
term of the earn-out arrangement expired in September2003. For the acquisitions of the Paulsboro Refinery and Basis Petroleum, Inc., Valero accounts for
payments under these arrangements as an additional cost of the respective acquisition when the
payments are made. As of December31, 2004, $593million of the aggregate earn-out payments
related to these acquisitions had been attributed to property, plant and equipment and is being
depreciated over the remaining lives of the assets to which the additional cost was allocated and
$1155million had been attributed to goodwill and is not being amortized. As discussed in Note 2, a liability for the aggregate limit of potential earn-out payments totaling
$175million related to the St. Charles Acquisition was accrued as of December31, 2004. The
offsetting amount is reflected in property, plant and equipment and is being depreciated over the
remaining lives of the assets to which the cost was allocated as part of the purchase price
allocation. In January2005, Valero made an earn-out payment of $500million related to the St.
Charles Acquisition. 24. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude 115 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a
formal plan of action. Environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable
undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as
well as Valeros own internal environmental policies. The balance of and changes in the accruals for environmental matters, which are principally
included in other long-term liabilities described in Note 13, were as follows in millions

In connection with its various acquisitions, Valero assumed several environmental liabilities
including, but not limited to, certain remediation obligations, site restoration costs and certain
liabilities relating to soil and groundwater remediation. The additional accrual related to the
UDS Acquisition in 2002 was primarily to conform the assessment of environmental liabilities
resulting from the UDS Acquisition by utilizing the same 20-year time period over which
environmental liabilities are determined under Valeros policy. Valero believes that it has adequately provided for its environmental exposures with the accruals
referred to above. These liabilities have not been reduced by potential future recoveries from
third parties. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
factors such as the timing and extent of remediation, the determination of Valeros obligation in
proportion to other parties, improvements in remediation technologies, and the extent to which
environmental laws and regulations may change in the future. In 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPAissued to a majority of refiners operating
in the United States a series of information requests pursuant to Section114 of the Clean Air Act
as part of an enforcement initiative. Valero received a Section114 information request pertaining
to all of its refineries owned at that time. Valero completed its response to the request, and it
has not been named in any enforcement proceeding by the EPA. Several other refiners, however, have
either reached global settlements with the EPA regarding this enforcement initiative or have been
subject to enforcement proceedings by the 116 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued EPA. Valero believes that it will be able to reach a
settlement with the EPA during 2005 applicable to all of its U.S. refineries. Valero expects to
incur penalties and related expenses in connection with a potential settlement, but Valero believes
that any settlement penalties will be immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and
financial position. In addition, Valero expects that a settlement of this matter will require
significant capital improvements or changes in operating parameters, or both, at most of Valeros
refineries. However, Valero expects that most of the required capital improvements or changes in
operating parameters will be consistent with many of Valeros existing or forecasted strategic
capital projects or emission reduction projects already planned for the next several years. 25. LITIGATION MATTERS Unocal
In 2002, Union Oil Company of California Unocal sued Valero alleging patent infringement. The
complaint seeks a 575 cent per gallon royalty on all reformulated gasoline infringing on Unocals
'393 and '126 patents. These patents cover certain compositions of cleaner-burning gasoline. The
complaint seeks treble damages for Valeros alleged willful infringement of Unocals patents and
Valeros alleged conduct to induce others to infringe the patents. In a previous lawsuit involving
its '393 patent, Unocal prevailed against five other major refiners. In 2001, the Federal Trade Commission FTCbegan an antitrust investigation concerning Unocals
misconduct with a joint industry research group and regulators during the time that Unocal was
prosecuting its patents at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office PTO. In 2003, the FTC filed a
complaint against Unocal for antitrust violations. The FTCs complaint seeks an injunction against
future '393 or '126 patent enforcement activity by Unocal against any person or entity with respect
to gasoline to be sold in California. The trial for the FTCs antitrust charges against Unocal
began before an administrative law judge ALJon October19, 2004. Closing arguments are expected
to occur in May2005, with an initial decision from the ALJ expected in mid to late June2005. The
ALJs decision will likely be appealed to the full Commission. In addition to the FTC proceedings, the '393 and '126 patents are being reexamined by the PTO. The
PTO has issued notices of rejection of all claims of each of these patents. These rejections are
subject to additional proceedings, including administrative appeal by Unocal, followed by an appeal
in federal district court or the court of appeals. Ultimate invalidation would preclude Unocal
from pursuing claims based on the '393 or '126 patents. Unocals patent lawsuit against Valero is indefinitely stayed as a result of the PTO reexamination
proceedings. Notwithstanding the judgment against the other refiners in the previous litigation,
Valero believes that it has several strong defenses to Unocals lawsuit, including those arising
from Unocals misconduct, and Valero believes it will prevail in the lawsuit. However, due to the
inherent uncertainty of litigation, it is reasonably possible that Valero will not prevail in the
lawsuit, and an adverse result could have a material effect on Valeros results of operations and
financial position. An estimate of the possible loss or range of loss from such an adverse result
cannot reasonably be made. MTBE Litigation
As of February28, 2005, Valero was named as a defendant in 63 cases alleging liability related to
MTBE contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water providers, governmental
authorities and private water companies alleging that refiners and marketers of MTBE and gasoline
containing MTBE are 117 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. Valero is named
in these suits together with many other
refining industry companies. Valero is being sued primarily as a refiner and marketer of MTBE and
gasoline containing MTBE. Valero does not own or operate gasoline station facilities in most of
the geographic locations in which damage is alleged to have occurred. The suits generally seek
individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys fees. All but one of
these cases have been removed to federal court by the defendants and have been, or soon will be,
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. Four of these cases have been selected by the court as focus cases for discovery and
pre-trial motions. Activity in the non-focus cases is generally stayed pending certain
determinations in the focus cases. Valero believes that it has strong defenses to these claims and
is vigorously defending the cases. Valero believes that an adverse result in any one of these
suits would not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position.
However, Valero believes that an adverse result in all or a substantial number of these cases could
have a material effect on Valeros results of operations and financial position. An estimate of
the possible losses or range of losses from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these
cases cannot reasonably be made. Other
Valero is also a party to additional claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
business. Valero believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or
proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse effect on its financial position,
results of operations or liquidity; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the
range of any possible loss cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of precision and Valero
cannot provide assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have
an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 118 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
