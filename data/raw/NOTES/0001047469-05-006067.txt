The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
NitroMed,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of NitroMed,Inc. as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of operations, redeemable convertible
preferred stock and stockholders' equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of NitroMed,Inc. at December31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. s/

NITROMED,INC.      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts    
1. The Company 
NitroMed is an emerging pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of proprietary pharmaceuticals based on the therapeutic
benefits of nitric oxide. The Company is currently developing it lead nitric oxide-enhancing drug candidate, BiDil, to treat African Americans diagnosed with heart failure. The Company goal is to
become a leading, multi-product pharmaceutical company by developing additional innovative nitric oxide products and by building on the Company BiDil development experience and infrastructure to
identify and market additional products for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases for the African American population. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
The financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. The majority of the Company cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are maintained with well-known, established financial institutions. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Investments with
maturities in excess of three months at the time of acquisition are classified as marketable securities and designated as available-for-sale. Cash equivalents consist of
institutional money market funds. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value, as reported by the custodian, and unrealized gains and losses are reported as
a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses were not material for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Financial instruments mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. The carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair
values. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range between
three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and recognizes an impairment 
55  loss
when the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. The asset is written down to its fair value determined by either a quoted market price or by a discounted
cash flow technique. 
Research and Development Expenses 
Research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees paid to consultants and outside service providers and
materials used in clinical trials and research and development. The Company charges research and development expenses, including costs associated with acquiring patents, to operations as incurred. 
The
Company enters into contracts with professional service providers to conduct clinical trials and related services. These professional service providers render services over an
extended period of time, generally one to three years. Typically, the Company enters into two types of vendor contracts, patient-based or time-based. Under a patient-based contract, the
Company first determines an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract, which include the estimated number of patients, the cost assigned to each patient based
on a patient number of visits and the total dollar value of the contract. The Company then records expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled during the period and the status of each
patient. Under a time based contract, using critical factors contained within the contract such as the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided, the Company records the
contractual expense for each service provided ratably over the period during which the Company estimates the service will be performed. On a monthly basis, the Company reviews both the timetable of
services to be rendered and the timing of services actually received based on regular communications with its vendors in order to gauge the reasonableness of its estimates. Based upon this review,
revisions may be made to the forecasted timetable or the extent of services performed, or both, in order to reflect the Company most current estimate of the contract. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is deemed earned when all of the following have occurred: all obligations of the Company relating to the revenue have been met and the earnings process is
complete; the monies received or receivable are not refundable irrespective of research results; and there are neither future obligations or milestones to be met by the Company with respect to such
revenue. The Company recognizes revenue from nonrefundable, up-front licenses and related payments, not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, ratably over the period that the
Company is obligated to participate on a continuing and substantial basis in the research and development activities outlined in each contract. When payments are specifically tied to a separate
earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment has been satisfied. Performance obligations typically consist of contracted services or
development milestones. Revenue from services performed under collaborative research agreements is recognized as reimbursable costs are incurred. Revenue from significant milestones in the development
lifecycle of the related technology, including initiation of clinical trials or filing for and obtaining approvals with regulatory agencies are considered earned when the payor acknowledges the
milestone achievement, which is generally by payment of amounts due. 
56  Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related Interpretations, rather than the alternative fair value accounting
provided under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS123. In accordance with
EITF96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for Acquiring, or in Connection with Selling, Goods or
Services EITF96-18, the Company records compensation expense equal to the fair value of the option granted to non-employees over the vesting
period, which is generally the period of service. 
FAS123
requires pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based awards to employees under the fair value
method of FAS123. The fair value of the Company stock options used to compute pro forma net loss is the estimated fair value at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions: December 31 2004
2003
2002 Risk-free interest rate
36 28 35 Expected volatility
94 80 80 Expected lives
4 years
4 years
4 years Expected dividend The
per-share, weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $966, $649 and $328,
respectively. 
For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the option vesting period. Had compensation expense for the Company stock-based
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans 
57  consistent
with the method of FAS123, the Company net loss and net loss per share would have been as follows: Years Ended December 31 2004
2003
2002 Net loss attributable to common stockholders as reported 29,773 30,920 20,039 Add: Stock-based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss 1,512 722 522 Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method 2,645 850 319 FAS 123 Pro forma net loss 30,906 31,048 19,836 Basic and diluted net loss per share As reported 114 695 2066 FAS 123 Pro forma 118 698 2045 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss 
The Company presents comprehensive income loss in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. Accumulated other comprehensive income is comprised entirely of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable
securities. 
Income Taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as
net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization. 
Net Loss Per Share 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the dilutive potential
common stock equivalents then outstanding. Potential common stock equivalents consist of stock options, warrants and redeemable convertible preferred stock. Since the Company has a net loss for all
periods presented, the effect of all potentially dilutive securities is antidilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share is the same. 
58  Segment Information 
During the three years ended December31, 2004, the Company operated in one reportable business segment, developing nitric oxide enhancing medicines, under
the management approach of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information.
New Accounting Standard 
On December16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123 revised 2004
FAS123R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. FAS123R supersedes Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally,
the approach in FAS123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS123, detailed below. However,
FAS123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. FAS123R must be adopted in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial
statements have not yet been issued. The Company expects to adopt FAS123R on July1, 2005, the commencement of its third quarter of fiscal 2005. 
FAS123R
permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods. A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date abased on the requirements of FAS123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and bbased on the requirements of SFAS123 for all
awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of FAS123R that remain unvested on the effective date. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified
prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either aall
prior periods presented or bprior interim periods of the year of adoption. The Company has yet to determine which method to use in adopting FAS123R. 
As
permitted by SFAS123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB 25 intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of FAS123R fair value method may have a significant impact on the Company result of operations, although it will
have no impact on the Company overall financial position. The impact of adoption of FAS123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted
in the future. However, had the Company adopted FAS123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS123 as described in the disclosure of
pro forma net loss and net loss per share in Note2 to these financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of FAS123R on its financial position
and results of operations, including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards.

4. Note Receivable from Stock Purchase Agreement 
On December31, 1997, the Company executed a $252,000 loan to an officer that was used to purchase 350,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company
at a purchase price of $072 per share. These shares were granted under the Company 1993 Equity Incentive Plan. The loan was due and payable in full in September2002, bore interest at a rate
of 602% per annum which interest was forgiven and was secured, pursuant to the terms of a Pledge Agreement, by the restricted shares. Twenty percent of the shares vested at the date of issuance and
an additional 20% of the shares vested annually each September. Based on the terms of the arrangement, the award was required to be accounted for as variable compensation. Accordingly, the Company
recorded noncash stock compensation charges for the year ended December31, 2002 of $392,000. In addition, during September2002, the Company forgave the loan and recorded an additional
noncash compensation charge of $252,000 for the year ended December31, 2002.

7. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and Stockholders' Equity Deficit 
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock  Public Offerings 
On November10, 2003, the Company completed its initial public offering and sold 6,000,000 shares of common stock for $1100 per share for net proceeds of
approximately $601million. In connection with the initial public offering all of the outstanding shares of the Company redeemable convertible preferred stock SeriesA, B, C, D, E
and F, including accrued but unpaid SeriesE dividends of $64million, converted into 18,398,496 shares of the Company common stock based upon the conversion ratios then applicable. On
December20, 2004, the Company closed a second public offering and sold 3,579,476 shares of common stock, including the underwriters' over-allotment of 331,598
shares, for $2446 per share for net proceeds of approximately $818million. 
SeriesE and F 
On August1, 2003, the Company completed the sale of 2,776,347 shares of SeriesE redeemable convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of
$199million. These shares automatically converted to common stock upon the closing of the Company initial public offering of common stock on November10, 2003. These shares contained
a beneficial conversion feature based on the fair value of the common stock into which the shares were convertible. In accordance with EITF 98-5, Accounting for
Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion Ratios, the value of such beneficial conversion feature of approximately
$83million was recognized as a deemed dividend in the three month period ended September30, 2003. 
The
SeriesF conversion ratio provided for additional shares of common stock when the Company issued equity securities, as defined, for consideration of less than $14 per share,
the purchase price of SeriesF. As a result of the above sale of these SeriesE shares, the SeriesF conversion ratio was increased from 1:1 to 1:1073364. The adjustment to the
SeriesF conversion ratio is a beneficial conversion feature. In accordance with EITF 00-27, Application of Issue 98-5 to Certain Convertible
Instruments, the value of such beneficial conversion feature of approximately $37,000 was recognized as a deemed dividend in the three month period ended September30,
2003. 
Subsequent
to the August2003 sale of the SeriesE shares, the SeriesE stockholders and the Company agreed to increase the SeriesE conversion ratio from 1:1
to 1:11526 in consideration of the SeriesE stockholders waiving their rights to certain anti-dilution provisions. The adjustment to the conversion ratio, which was contingent on
the initial public offering, is a beneficial conversion feature. In accordance with EITF 00-27, the value of the SeriesE beneficial conversion feature of approximately
$110million was recognized as a deemed dividend in the period of issuance, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 as a result of the initial public offering. In addition, the conversion
of the SeriesE shares in the initial public offering caused the accrued but unpaid SeriesE dividends of approximately $64million to become payable through the issuance of
513,033 shares of common stock at the time of the initial public offering.

10. Research, License and Consulting Agreements 
The Company has entered into various research, license and consulting agreements to support its research and development activities. Johnson Johnson Agreements 
Prior to 2001, the Company had two principal research and development collaboration agreements, both dated April1997, in which the Company had licensed
its technology to Johnson Johnson and affiliates in return for initial license fees, reimbursement of qualified research expenditures and the purchase of 30million shares of
SeriesB for $30million. The agreements contained provisions for future payments to the Company upon the achievement of certain research and development milestones and future royalties
to the Company on sales of products developed under the agreements. One of the agreements with affiliates of Johnson Johnson was terminated in April2000, and the other agreement was
terminated in September2001. 
With
respect to one of the Johnson Johnson agreements noted above, during 2001, the Company reacquired the previously licensed technology in consideration of future payments
totaling $45million. The Company is required to make payments to Johnson Johnson contingent upon the occurrence of the following events: a portion of up-front and
milestone payments received in consideration for granting the rights to the technology; a percent of net sales revenue generated by the Company from product manufactured using the technology; and a
percentage of royalty payments received based upon the sale of products derived from the technology. Payments are only required upon the occurrence of such events. Through December31, 2004,
the Company had paid $375,000 to Johnson Johnson as a result of receiving payments for licensing the reacquired technology. 
Boston Scientific Corporation Agreement 
In November 2001, the Company entered into a development and license agreement with Boston Scientific Corporation BSC that granted a nonexclusive, nonroyalty
bearing right and license in certain technology, which had been reacquired from Johnson Johnson as noted above. In consideration of the license, the Company received a nonrefundable
up-front license payment of $15million. At the same time the Company sold to BSC 250,000 shares of SeriesF for $35million. Under the agreement, the Company
planned to deliver two drug compounds, as defined in the agreement, to BSC during the two year research term. Accordingly, the Company was recognizing the $15million license fee as revenue
ratably over the term of its contractual performance obligation. In January2003, the Company informally agreed to an extension of the research term to May2004. As a result, the Company
extended the period of revenue recognition for the unrecognized portion of the license payment at December31, 2002 to May31, 2004. In December2003 the Company executed an
amendment to extend the research term to December31, 2005 and received an additional $30million. The Company is recognizing the $30million extension fee and the remaining
deferred revenue related to the nonrefundable license payment of $15million over the extension period. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized
revenue of $1,592,000, $442,000 and $750,000, respectively. 
In
connection with the agreement, the Company may receive up to $83million in milestone payments if certain development events are achieved by BSC. The Company may receive
additional milestone payments for commercial success of any products derived from the licensed technology by 
67  BSC.
The Company also has the right to receive milestone payments for any individual product that exceeds certain sales levels in any consecutive 12-month period. In addition, the Company
may receive royalty payments on net sales of products derived from the licensed technology. The royalty term, which is on a country by country basis, related to each product derived by the licensed
technology will generally be 12years. 
BiDil License Agreement 
In connection with its development program for BiDil, the Company lead product candidate, the Company entered into an agreement to license certain technology
from an individual who is on the Company scientific advisory board. The Company also receives services from this individual in consideration of nominal payments and the grant of stock options. Upon
achieving certain development events, the Company is required to make milestone payments of up to $1million in the aggregate. In addition, upon commercial sale of products developed from the
technology, the Company is required to make royalty payments on net sales, which will vary depending on sales volume. The royalty term expires upon the later of the expiration of the patent rights or
ten years from the first commercial sale. The agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time. During the year ended December31,
2004, the Company recorded charges of $10million to research and development expense related to this agreement. Merck Agreement 
In December of 2002, the Company executed a research collaboration and license agreement with Merck Frosst Canada Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Merck Co. Merck, in which the Company granted an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain existing technology and any technology, pertaining to the licensed technology,
developed by the Company during a three-year period commencing January1, 2003. In consideration of this license, the Company received $10million in January of 2003. During
the three-year period, the Company was obligated to perform certain research and development activities in consideration of quarterly fees totaling $72million. The Company was
recognizing the license fee as revenue ratably over the term of its contractual performance obligation of three years. In
connection with this agreement, the Company could have received milestone payments associated with certain development and approval events and sales and marketing events. For the year
ended December31, 2003, the Company recognized revenue of $123million related to $150million of license and milestone payments that had been deferred and were being
recognized as revenue ratably over the contractual research and development term, a $50million milestone payment for advancing a lead nitric oxide enhancing COX-2 inhibitor into
Phase I human testing and $30million of research and development funding. 
In
November 2004, the Company agreed with Merck to terminate the collaboration agreement. Merck paid the Company a lump sum of $18million, representing the full amount of the
research funding owed to the Company for 2005. The Company will not receive any commercialization milestones or royalty payments from Merck. As a result of the termination of this agreement, the
Company accelerated the recognition of deferred license revenue of $53million, and recognized the lump sum payment of $18million as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the
year ended 
68  December31,
2004, the Company recognized revenue of $149million under the collaboration agreement. 11. Income Taxes

69  12. Commitments and Contingencies 
In connection with its pursuit of obtaining FDA approval of BiDil, the Company contracted with a consulting firm for services related to the development approval
process of BiDil. The agreement provides for payment of legal consulting fees if and when the Company receives written FDA approval of BiDil. In addition, the agreement requires the Company to pay
royalties on sales of BiDil product. The royalty term ends six months from the date of market introduction of an FDA approved generic version of the BiDil product. During the year ended

An
academic institution has asserted that patents and patent applications which relate to the nitric oxide stent program may require a license from such institution. It is the opinion of
the Company management and legal counsel that the disputed intellectual property has been validly licensed to, or is validly owned by, the Company. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements
do not include any provision related to this claim.

institutions who may have traded in the Company common stock prior to the July19, 2004 announcement. The Company has cooperated with this review and has identified certain persons on the
list provided to the Company by the NASD as having a relationship with the Company chief executive officer and others at the Company. The Company has established a special committee of its board of
directors to oversee the Company response to this review. The Company is presently unable to predict the outcome of this matter or the timing of its resolution. 
The
Company has engaged Schwarz Pharma under a five-year exclusive manufacturing and supply agreement solely for the three times daily immediate release dosage formulation of
NitroMed BiDil product candidate. Under the Supply Agreement, NitroMed will have the right to engage a backup manufacturer. The Company orders bulk materials from the same suppliers that were used

34 PART II Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December31, 2004. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the company management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its
judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2004,
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
No
change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
