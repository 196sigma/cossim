REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors of Heska Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Heska
Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997
and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the three years
ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Heska Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 1996,
1997 and 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                           Arthur Andersen LLP

1.  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS
Heska Corporation Heska or the Company is primarily focused on the
discovery, development and marketing of companion animal health products. In
addition to manufacturing certain of Heska companion animal health products,
the Company primary manufacturing subsidiary, Diamond Animal Health, Inc.
Diamond, also manufactures bovine vaccine products and pharmaceutical and
personal healthcare products which are marketed and distributed by third
parties. In addition to manufacturing veterinary allergy products for marketing
and sale by Heska, Heska subsidiaries, Center Laboratories, Inc. Center
and CMG-Heska Allergy Products S.A. CMG, a Swiss corporation, also
manufacture and sell human allergy products. The Company also offers diagnostic
services to veterinarians at its Fort Collins, Colorado location and in the
United Kingdom through a wholly-owned subsidiary.
From the Company inception in 1988 until early 1996, the Company
operating activities related primarily to research and development activities,
entering into collaborative agreements, raising capital and recruiting
personnel. Prior to 1996, the Company had not received any revenues from the
sale of products.  During 1996, Heska grew from being primarily a research and
development concern to a fully-integrated research, development, manufacturing
and marketing company. The Company accomplished this by acquiring Diamond, a
licensed pharmaceutical and biological manufacturing facility in Des Moines,
Iowa, hiring key employees and support staff, establishing marketing and sales
operations to support Heska products introduced in 1996, and designing and
implementing more sophisticated operating and information systems. The Company
also expanded the scope and level of its scientific and business development
activities, increasing the opportunities for new products. In 1997, the Company
introduced 13 additional products and expanded in the United States through the
acquisition of Center, a Food and Drug Administration FDA and United States
Department of Agriculture USDA licensed manufacturer of allergy
immunotherapy products located in Port Washington, New York, and internationally
through the acquisitions of Heska UK Limited Heska UK, formerly Bloxham
Laboratories Limited, a veterinary diagnostic laboratory in Teignmouth, England
and CMG formerly Centre Medical des Grand'Places S.A. in Fribourg,
Switzerland, which manufactures and markets allergy diagnostic products for use
in veterinary and human medicine, primarily in Europe. Each of the Company
acquisitions during this period was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and accordingly, the Company financial statements reflect the
operations of these businesses only for the periods subsequent to the
acquisitions. In July 1997, the Company established a new subsidiary, Heska AG,
located near Basel, Switzerland, for the purpose of managing its European
operations.
During the first quarter of 1998 the Company acquired Sensor Devices, Inc.
SDI, a manufacturer and marketer of patient monitoring devices used in both
animal health and human applications. The financial results of SDI have been
consolidated with those of the Company under the pooling-of-interests accounting
method for all periods presented.
The Company has incurred net losses since its inception and anticipates
that it will continue to incur additional net losses in the near term as it
introduces new products, expands its sales and marketing capabilities and
continues its research and development activities. Cumulative net losses from
inception of the Company in 1988 through December 31, 1998 have totaled $1168
million.
The Company ability to achieve profitable operations will depend
primarily upon its ability to successfully market its products, commercialize
products that are currently under development, develop new products and
efficiently integrate acquired businesses. Most of the Company products are
subject to long development and regulatory approval cycles and there can be no
guaranty that the Company will successfully develop, manufacture or market these
products. There can also be no guaranty that the Company will attain
profitability or, if achieved, will remain profitable on a quarterly or annual
basis in the future. Until the Company attains positive cash flow, the Company
may continue to finance operations with additional equity and debt financing.
There can be no guaranty that such financing will be available when required or
will be obtained under favorable terms.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and of its wholly-owned subsidiaries since their respective dates of
acquisitions when accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, and for
all periods presented when accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method
of accounting. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market, and
include short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of less
than three months. Cash equivalents consist of United States government
obligations.
Marketable Securities and Restricted Investments
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale
and, accordingly, carries such securities at aggregate fair value. Unrealized
gains or losses, if material, are included as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income.
At December 31, 1997 these securities had an aggregate amortized cost of
$187 million, which approximated fair market value, a maximum maturity of
approximately three years and consisted entirely of U.S. government obligations.
At December 31, 1998 these securities had an aggregate amortized cost of $462
million, a maximum maturity of approximately ten years and consisted entirely of
U.S. government agency obligations. The fair market value of marketable
securities at December 31, 1998 was approximately $463 million. The unrealized
gain of approximately $85,000 has been recorded as a component of accumulated
comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Marketable securities at
December 31, 1997 and 1998 included approximately $645,000 and $281,000 of
restricted investments held as collateral for capital leases See Note 4 and
$181 million and $460 million of short-term marketable securities,
respectively.
Inventories, net
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in,
first-out method. If the cost of inventories exceeds fair market value,
provisions are made for the difference between cost and fair market value.
Inventories, net of provisions, consist of the following in thousands                                         December 31,

Property, Equipment and Intangible Assets
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-
line or declining balance basis over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. Amortization of assets acquired under capital leases is included with
depreciation expense on owned assets.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the applicable lease period or
their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense when incurred, and major renewals and improvements are
capitalized.
Intangible assets primarily consist of various assets arising from business
combinations and are amortized using the straight-line method over the period of
expected benefit.
The Company periodically reviews the appropriateness of the remaining life
of its property, equipment and intangible assets considering whether any events
have occurred or conditions have developed which may indicate that the remaining
life requires adjustment. After reviewing the appropriateness of the remaining
life and the pattern of usage of these assets, the Company then assesses their
overall recoverability by determining if the net book value can be recovered
through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Absent any unfavorable
findings, the Company continues to amortize and depreciate its property,
equipment and intangible assets based on the existing estimated life.
Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands                                             December 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Revenue Recognition
Product revenues are recognized at the time goods are shipped to the
customer, or at the time services are performed, with an appropriate provision
for returns and allowances.
The Company recognizes revenue from sponsored research and development as
research activities are performed or as development milestones are completed
under the terms of the research and development agreements. Costs incurred in
connection with the performance of sponsored research and development are
expensed as incurred. The Company defers revenue recognition of advance
payments received during the current year until research activities are
performed or development milestones are completed.
Cost of Sales
Royalties payable in connection with certain research, development and
licensing agreements See Note 10 are reflected in cost of sales as incurred.
Unaudited Pro Forma Basic Net Loss Per Share
The Company has computed net loss per share in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which the
Company adopted in 1997. Also, the Company has adopted the guidance of
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No.
98 and related interpretations. Due to the automatic conversion of all shares
of convertible preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of the
Company initial public offering in July 1997 the IPO, historical basic net
loss per common share for fiscal 1996 and 1997 is not considered meaningful as
it would differ materially from the pro forma basic net loss per common share
and common stock equivalent shares given the changes in the capital structure of
the Company.
Pro forma basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss
per common share is not presented as the effect of common equivalent shares from
stock options and warrants is anti-dilutive. The Company has assumed the
conversion of convertible preferred stock issued into common stock for all
periods presented.
Prior to the current period and pursuant to SEC SAB No. 83 rules, common
stock and common stock equivalent shares issued by the Company during the 12
months immediately preceding the filing of the IPO, plus shares which became
issuable during the same period as a result of the granting of options to
purchase common stock SAB 83 Shares, were included in the calculation of
basic weighted average number of shares of common stock as if they were
outstanding for all periods presented using the treasury stock method,
regardless of whether they were anti-dilutive. In February 1998 the SEC issued
SAB No. 98 which replaced SAB No. 83 in its entirety. As a result, SAB 83
Shares which were originally included in the previously reported 1996 and 1997
weighted average common shares outstanding have now been excluded in the
restated 1996 and 1997 weighted average common shares outstanding. The effect
of the adoption of SAB No. 98 was as follows per share amounts for 1996 and
1997 have been restated to include the effects of the SDI acquisition recorded
under the pooling-of-interests accounting method. See Note 3                                   Year Ended December 31,

forward contracts or hedging transactions.
3. BUSINESS ACQUISITION
Acquisition of SDI - In March 1998 the Company completed its acquisition of
all of the outstanding shares of SDI, a manufacturer and marketer of medical
sensor products, in a transaction valued at approximately $89 million using the
pooling-of-interests accounting method. The Company issued 639,622 shares of
its common stock and also reserved an additional 147,898 shares of its common
stock for

The Company has entered into certain capital lease agreements for laboratory
equipment, office equipment, machinery and equipment, and computer equipment and
software. For the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company had
capitalized machinery and equipment under capital leases with a net book value
of approximately $31 million and $19 million, respectively. The capitalized
cost of the equipment under capital leases is included in the accompanying
balance sheets under the respective asset classes. Under the terms of the
Company lease agreements, the Company is required to make monthly payments of
principal and interest through the year 2003, at interest rates ranging from
405% to 2000% per annum. The equipment under the capital leases serves as
security for the leases.
The Company has a capital lease with a commercial bank which requires the
Company to pledge cash or investments as additional collateral for the lease.
The lease agreement, which has a borrowing limit of $20 million calls for a
collateral balance equal to 25% of the borrowed amount when the Company annual
revenues reach $280 million. The lease also requires the Company to maintain
minimum levels of cash and cash equivalent balances throughout the term of the
lease. As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company was in compliance with all
covenants of the master lease and held restricted U.S. Treasury Bonds of
approximately $645,000 and $281,000 as additional collateral under the lease,
respectively.

5. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
In December 1998 the Company completed a cost reduction and restructuring
plan. The restructuring was based on the Company determination that, while
revenues had been increasing steadily, management believed that reducing
expenses was necessary in order to accelerate the Company efforts to reach
profitability. In connection with the restructuring, the Company recognized a
charge to operations in 1998 of approximately $24 million. These expenses
related to personnel severance costs for 69 individuals and costs associated
with excess facilities and equipment, primarily at the Company Fort Collins,
Colorado location.

The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. As of December 31, 1998 the Company had
approximately $945 million of net operating loss NOL carryforwards for
income tax purposes and approximately $23 million of research and development
tax credits available to offset future federal income tax, subject to
limitations for alternative minimum tax. The NOL and credit carryforwards are
subject to examination by the tax authorities and expire in various years from
2003 through 2011. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that may
limit the NOL and credit carryforwards available for use in any given year upon
the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership
interest. A change in ownership of a company
48
HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS of greater than 50% within a three-year period results in an annual limitation
on the Company ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards from tax periods prior
to the ownership change. The acquisition of Diamond in April 1996 resulted in
such a change of ownership and the Company estimates that the resulting NOL
carryforward limitation will be approximately $47 million per year for periods
subsequent to April 19, 1996. In addition, the Company believes that its follow-
on public offering of common stock in March 1998 resulted in a further change
of ownership. This limitation will total approximately $125 million per year
for periods subsequent to the follow-on offering. The Company believes that
these limitations may affect the eventual utilization of its total NOL
carryforwards.
The acquisition of Diamond was completed on a tax free basis. Accordingly,
the basis of the assets for financial reporting purposes exceeds the basis of
the assets for income tax purposes. The Company has recorded a deferred tax
liability related to this basis difference. As the Company had previously
recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, the Company
reduced its valuation allowance in an amount equal to the deferred tax liability
at the date of the merger.
The Company NOLs represent a previously unrecognized tax benefit.
Recognition of these benefits requires future taxable income, the attainment of
which is uncertain, and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established
for the entire tax benefit and no benefit for income taxes has been recognized
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following in thousands                                                        December

9.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
In June 1994, the Company entered into agreements with Bayer AG Bayer, a
pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which Bayer is funding and assisting in the
development of certain technologies. In return, the Company granted Bayer the
option to license the technologies to manufacture certain products for sale, as
well as the right to distribute for all parts of the world, except Japan and
East Asia. To the extent the Company is determined to have manufacturing
capabilities, under the terms of the agreement, Bayer will be required to
purchase its requirements for such products from the Company.
49
HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In exchange for the above, Bayer agreed to provide research funding to the
Company, of which $500,000 was received in 1996, $550,000 in 1997 and $11
million in 1998. The Company expects to receive periodic research payments
until December 1999 as the related expenses are incurred and specified
milestones are reached. In connection with this contract, the Company
recognized research revenue of $13 million, $12 million and $850,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Additionally, the Company will receive royalties based on a percentage of
any net sales of products developed under the agreements not manufactured by the
Company.
Bayer may terminate the agreement for convenience at any anniversary, with
90 days notice, in which case, the product rights revert to the Company. In the
event of such a termination, the Company would be required to pay Bayer a
royalty at a modest rate on net sales of these products exceeding a specified
threshold. The total amount of this royalty would not exceed the amount of
research funding provided by Bayer.
In January 1993, the Company entered into an agreement with Eisai Co., Ltd.
Eisai pursuant to which Eisai obtained the exclusive right to market certain
products in Japan and East Asia. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
is to receive periodic payments for support of research, one half of which is
only to be received upon completion of certain milestones. No revenue was
recognized for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 or 1998. Although the
agreement does not expire until 2008, Eisai may terminate its research support
for any product with 90 days written notice.
In October 1996, the Company and Diamond entered into three related
agreements with a pharmaceutical company concerning the research, development,
licensing, manufacturing and marketing of certain products. Under the research
and development agreement, Diamond granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, paid-
up right and license to develop, manufacture and market certain of its bovine
products. In return, the pharmaceutical company agreed to fund certain research
costs associated with the development of these products, subject to the
achievement of certain milestones. In connection with this research funding,
the Company recognized research and development revenue of $210,000 during the
fourth quarter of 1996, and $11 million and $460,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. As additional consideration, the
Company received an exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license for certain
feline biological vaccines. The Company also has a three-year agreement with
the pharmaceutical company for the manufacture of these feline vaccines.
The Company estimates its future cash flows from its existing research and
development contracts, subject to scheduled completion of specified milestones,
are as follows in thousands         Year Ending

Common Stock
In July 1998, the Company issued 1165 million shares of the Company
common stock to Ralston Purina Company Ralston Purina, for $1475 million in
cash, and also issued, for an additional cash payment of $250,000, warrants to

exercise price of the warrants is $1267 for the first year of the warrants,
increasing by 20% per year for each of the second and third years of the
warrants. The warrants were exercisable immediately as of July 30, 1998 and
expire in three years with respect to any unexercised shares.
In July 1998, the Company issued 205,619 shares of common stock to Bayer
Corporation Bayer in consideration for the acquisition by Diamond of certain
assets, including land and buildings formerly leased by Diamond from Bayer, and
as repayment in full of certain indebtedness of Diamond to Bayer, in a
transaction valued at approximately $23 million.

HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   In March 1998, the Company completed its follow-on public offering of
5,750,000 shares of common stock including 500,000 shares offered by a
stockholder of the Company and an underwriters' over-allotment option exercised
for 750,000 shares at a price of $9875 per share, providing the Company with
net proceeds of approximately $486 million.
In July 1997, the Company completed its IPO of 5,637,850 shares of common
stock including an underwriters' over-allotment option exercised for 637,850
shares at a price of $850 per share, providing the Company with net proceeds
of approximately $439 million. Upon closing of the IPO, all of the outstanding
shares of Series A, B, C, D, E and F preferred stock were automatically
converted into 11,289,388 shares of common stock.
The Company has granted stock purchase rights to acquire 322,000 shares of
common stock to key executives and Directors pursuant to the 1994 Key Executive
Stock Plan. As of December 31, 1998, executives had exercised all of these
stock purchase rights by executing promissory notes payable to the Company. The
fair market value of the underlying common stock equaled the exercise price on
the date of grant and exercise. The notes mature in six years, bear interest at
75% and are secured by a pledge of the underlying shares of common stock.
Under the terms of the Key Executive Stock Plan, if the purchaser relationship
with the Company ceases for any reason within 48 months of the grant date, the
Company may, within 90 days following termination, repurchase at the original
exercise price all of the stock which has not vested. The stock vests ratably
over a 48 month period. During the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998,
250,834 and 310,520 shares had vested and been released from the purchase
option, respectively.
Stock Option Plans
The Company has a stock option plan which authorizes the grant of stock
options and stock purchase rights to employees, officers, directors and
consultants of the Company to purchase shares of common stock. In 1997, the
board of directors adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan and
terminated two prior option plans. However, options granted and unexercised
under the prior plans are still outstanding. All shares remaining available for
grant under the terminated plans were rolled into the 1997 Plan. In addition,
all shares which are subsequently cancelled under the prior plans are rolled
into the 1997 Plan on a quarterly basis. The number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 1997 Plan increases automatically on January 1 of each year
by a number equal to the lesser of a 1,500,000 shares or b 5% of the shares
of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31. The
number of shares reserved for issuance under all plans as of January 1, 1999 was
5,291,283.
The stock options granted by the board of directors may be either incentive
stock options ISOs or nonstatutory stock options NSOs. The purchase
price for options under all of the plans may be no less than 100% of fair market
value for ISOs or 85% of fair market value for NSOs. Options granted will
expire no later than the tenth anniversary subsequent to the date of grant or 90
days following termination of employment, except in cases of death or
disability, in which case the options will remain exercisable for up to twelve
months. Under the terms of the 1997 Plan, in the event the Company is sold or
merged, options granted will either be assumed by the surviving corporation or
vest immediately.
SFAS No. 123 SFAS 123
SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, defines a fair value
based method of accounting for employee stock options, employee stock purchases,
or similar equity instruments. However, SFAS 123 allows the continued
measurement of compensation cost for such plans using the intrinsic value based
method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25, provided that pro forma disclosures are made of net income
or loss, assuming the fair value based method of SFAS 123 had been applied. The
Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under APB
25; accordingly, for purposes of the pro forma disclosures presented below, the
Company has computed the fair values of all options granted during 1996, 1997
and 1998, using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following weighted
average assumptions                    52

options will be exercised at varying schedules after becoming fully vested
dependent upon the income level of the option holder. For measurement purposes,
options have been segregated into three income groups, and estimated exercise
behavior of option recipients varies from six months to one and one half years
from the date of vesting, dependent on income group less highly compensated
employees are expected to have shorter holding periods. All options are
initially assumed to vest. Cumulative compensation cost recognized in pro forma
basic net income or loss with respect to options that are forfeited prior to
vesting is adjusted as a reduction of pro forma compensation expense in the
period of forfeiture. Because the Company common stock has only recently been
publicly traded, the expected market volatility was estimated for 1996 using the
estimated average volatility of four publicly held companies which the Company
believes to be similar with respect to the markets in which they compete.
Actual volatility of the Company stock was used for 1997 and 1998
computations. Fair value computations are highly sensitive to the volatility
factor assumed; the greater the volatility, the higher the computed fair value
of the options granted.
The total fair value of options granted was computed to be approximately
$12 million, $50 million and $88 million for the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The amounts are amortized ratably over the
vesting periods of the options. Pro forma stock-based compensation, net of the
effect of forfeitures, was $367,000, $18 million and $39 million for 1996,
1997 and 1998, respectively.

HESKA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
During 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of a new accounting
standard, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement
of Position SOP No. 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities,
which requires that start-up costs, including organization costs, be expensed as
incurred rather than capitalized. The adoption of this Statement has had no
effect on the Company reported results of operations.
During 1998 , the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. The Statement establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive
income, as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period
from non-owner sources. The Company has reported comprehensive income loss in
the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity, and statements
of operations and comprehensive loss.
During 1998, the Company adopted the provisions SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair
value. The Statement requires that changes in the derivative fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedging criteria are met. The
adoption of this Statement has had no effect on the Company reported earnings
or comprehensive income.
The AICPA has also issued SOP No. 98-1, Software for Internal Use, which
provides guidance on accounting for the cost of computer software developed or
obtained for internal use. SOP No. 98-1 is effective for financial statements
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The Company does not expect
that that the adoption of SOP No. 98-1 will have a material impact on its
financial statements.
