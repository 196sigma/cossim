27           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Billing Concepts Corp.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Billing
Concepts Corp. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30,
1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September
30, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Billing Concepts
Corp. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998, 1997 AND 1996 NOTE 1. BUSINESS ACTIVITY
Billing Concepts Corp. BCC, formerly known as Billing Information
Concepts Corp., was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1996. BCC was
previously a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Long Distance Corp. USLD that,
upon its spin-off from USLD, became an independent, publicly held company. BCC
and its subsidiaries collectively, the Company primarily provide billing
clearinghouse and information management services in the United States to the
telecommunications industry. In addition to processing call records, the Company
provides a wide range of back office services including customer service, data
processing, tax filings, accounting services and an advance funding program. The
Company also develops, licenses and supports billing systems for
telecommunications service providers and provides direct billing services.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of BCC and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company 22% investment in the
capital stock of Princeton TeleCom Corporation PTC see Note 5 is accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
On August 2, 1996 the Distribution Date, USLD distributed all of
the outstanding common stock of BCC, pro rata to the stockholders of USLD the
Distribution with the result being that BCC became an independent, publicly
held company that owns and operates all of the assets of, and is responsible for
all of the liabilities associated with, the billing clearinghouse and
information management services business previously owned by USLD. The
accompanying financial statements include the operations of BCC which, until the
Distribution, were combined with and reported as part of the consolidated
financial statements of USLD.
Certain selling, general and administrative expenses of USLD were
historically accounted for on a consolidated basis with no allocation to
individual subsidiaries. The historical statements of BCC have been adjusted to
include all of the expenses that appropriately and fairly could have been
allocated to BCC except for income taxes. USLD federal income taxes have
historically been determined on a consolidated basis. For purposes of preparing
the BCC historical consolidated financial statements, income taxes have been
determined on a separate company basis. Deferred taxes have been recorded on
BCC consolidated financial statements, as appropriate. Tax assets and
liabilities are reflected in a manner consistent with the Tax Sharing Agreement
between USLD and BCC.
Certain intercompany transactions that had previously been eliminated
in consolidation are properly reflected in the historical consolidated financial
statements of BCC at amounts that are believed by management to reflect an
arm-length relationship. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified
for comparative purposes.
Estimates in the Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    32
33 Revenue Recognition Policies
The Company recognizes revenue from its billing services when records
that are to be billed and collected by the Company are processed. Revenue from
the sale of billing systems, including the licensing of software rights, is
recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer, provided that
the Company has no significant related obligations or collection uncertainties
remaining. If there are significant obligations related to the installation or
development of the system delivered, revenue is recognized in the period that
the Company fulfills its obligations. Services revenue related to the Company
billing systems is recognized in the period that the services are provided.
Billing Services
The Company provides billing services to operator services providers
and direct dial long distance companies through billing agreements with the
local telephone companies, which maintain the critical database of end-user
names and addresses of the billed parties. Bills are generated by the local
telephone companies and the collected funds are remitted to the Company, which
in turn remits these funds, net of fees, to its billing customers. The Company
records a trade accounts receivable and operating revenue for fees charged for
its billing services. When the customer receivables are collected by the
Company from the local telephone companies, the Company trade receivables are
reduced by the amount corresponding to the Company processing fees and the
remaining funds are recorded as an accounts payable to billing customers.
The Company offers participation in an advance funding program to
qualifying customers through its Advance Payment Agreement. Under the terms of
this agreement, the Company purchases the customer accounts receivable for an
amount equal to the face amount of the billing records submitted to the local
telephone companies by the Company for billing and collection less     o    all local telephone company charges, rejects, unbillables and
bad debt deductions     o    all credits and adjustments granted to end users     o    all of the Company processing fees and sales taxes, if
appropriate     o    all financing service charges assessed by the Company; and
o    any and all losses, costs or expenses incurred by the Company
in processing or collecting the customer accounts from all
previously billed records.
The purchase price is remitted by the Company to its customers in two
payments. Within five days from receiving a customer records, an initial
payment is made to the customer based on a percentage of the face amount of the
customer call records submitted by the Company to the local telephone
companies. The Company pays the remaining balance of the purchase price to the
customer upon collection of funds from the local telephone companies. The
purchase date is the date the initial payment is made. In connection with its
purchase of billing records, the Company may draw on its revolving credit
facility.                    33
34     Any accounts receivable purchased by the Company are recorded as
purchased receivables in an amount equal to the face amount of the billing
records submitted to the local telephone companies by the Company for billing
and collection. Concurrently, an equal amount is recorded as accounts payable to
billing customers. The amount of the initial payment made to the customer
reduces accounts payable to billing customers. The balance, reported as accounts
payable to billing customers $118,599,000 and $75,166,000 at September 30, 1998
and 1997, respectively, consists of     o    an amount equal to the face value of all purchased
receivables, reduced for any amounts paid as initial payments
under Advance Payment Agreements     o    an amount equal to collections from local telephone companies
that have not yet been remitted to customers, and
o    an amount accrued for the estimated liability associated with
future end-user refunds and local telephone company
adjustments related to customers who are no longer serviced by
the Company.
The purchased receivables balance is relieved at the time the customer
receivables are collected from the local telephone companies. Any differences
between the amount initially recorded as a purchased receivable and the amount
ultimately collected from the local telephone companies are recorded as a
reduction of both the purchased receivable and accounts payable to billing
customers in an equal amount. The funds are remitted to the customer after the
Company deducts the amount funded, the financing service charges earned under
the Advance Payment Agreement, local telephone company billing fees due the
Company and any end-user customer service refunds.
The Company has some risk with regard to these deductions to the extent
that they exceed the amount collected from the local telephone companies.
Generally, the Company will collect these amounts from future funds received
from the local telephone companies. However, in certain cases, such as if the
Company is no longer providing services to the customer, there may not be
adequate funds from which to collect these amounts. The Company does have the
right of offset against all funds held for the account of such customers and may
hold a first lien security interest in such billing customers' accounts,
generally including those not acquired by the Company. The Company has an
accrued liability included in the balance sheet caption entitled Accounts
payable - billing customers for the estimated amount that such deductions
exceed funds withheld from such customers.
The following receivables purchased and financed by the Company were
outstanding at                                SEPTEMBER 30,
1998     1997
IN THOUSANDS
Purchased  $64,477   $70,175 Software Services
The Company also develops, sells and supports convergent billing
systems for telecommunications service providers and provides direct billing
outsourcing. In addition to license and maintenance fees charged by the Company
for the use of its billing software applications, fees are also charged on a
time and materials basis for software customization and professional services.
Processing fees for direct billing services provided through the Company
service bureau are assessed to customers based on volume. Billing systems
revenues also include retail sales of computer hardware and third-party
software.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, which range from three to ten years. Upon
disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are
removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in other
income expense for that period. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred, and major improvements are capitalized.                    34
35 Other Assets
Other assets include costs incurred to acquire billing agreements with
local telephone companies for billing and collection services and other
agreements. These costs are being amortized over five to seven years. Other
assets also include financing costs related to the issuance of debt, which have
been deferred and are amortized over the life of the respective financing
agreement, and goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of a
software development company see Note 5.
In addition, long-term deposits have been included in other assets.
Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities include sales taxes payable on behalf of billing
customers of $18,866,000 and $15,174,975139074000 at September 30, 1998 and
1997, respectively.
The Company self-insures its medical coverage for employees and
dependents up to $40,000 per covered individual and an aggregate annual maximum
of $1 million. The Company accrues for known claims and an estimate of claims
incurred but not reported up to the maximum anticipated cost to the Company.
During 1998, the Company recognized approximately $420,000 in self-insurance
expense. The Company insurer will pay cumulative claims above the attachment
limit up to $960,000 lifetime per covered individual. The Company does not
believe that claims reported and claims incurred but not reported will exceed
the amounts to be covered by the insurer.
Common Stock Dividend
On January 9, 1998, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a one-for-one common stock dividend. The dividend was distributed on
January 30, 1998 to stockholders of record on January 20, 1998. No additional
proceeds were received on the dividend date and all costs associated with the
share dividend were capitalized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements has been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock dividend.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of the Company cash and cash equivalents
and all other financial instruments have been determined using appropriate
valuation methodologies and approximate their related carrying values.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on enacted
income tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period in which the
deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. A change
in the tax laws or rates results in adjustments to the deferred tax assets or
liabilities. The effects of such adjustments are required to be included in
income in the period in which the tax laws or rates are changed.
BCC and USLD entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that defines the
parties' respective rights and obligations with respect to deficiencies and
refunds of federal, state and other income or franchise taxes relating to BCC
business for tax years prior to the Distribution and with respect to certain tax
attributes of BCC after the Distribution. In general, with respect to periods
ending on or before the last day of the year in which the Distribution occurred,
USLD is responsible for i filing both consolidated federal tax returns for the
USLD affiliated group and combined or consolidated state tax returns for any
group that includes a member of the USLD affiliated group, including in each
case BCC and its subsidiaries for the relevant periods of time that such
companies were members of the applicable group, and ii paying the taxes
related to such returns including any subsequent adjustments resulting from the
redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable taxing authorities.
BCC will reimburse USLD for a portion of such taxes and the cost of preparation
of the associated tax returns related to the BCC affiliated group. BCC is
responsible for filing returns and paying taxes related to the BCC affiliated
group for subsequent periods. BCC and USLD have agreed to cooperate with each
other and to share information in preparing such tax returns and in dealing with
other tax matters.                    35
36 Net Income Per Common Share
Earnings per share for all periods have been restated to reflect the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, which established standards for computing and presenting
earnings per share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or
potential common stock. SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex
capital structures. Basic EPS were computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially
dilutive options and warrants that were outstanding during the period. The
effects of potentially dilutive securities are excluded in periods in which a
loss is reported because their inclusion would be antidilutive. The per share
and weighted average common shares outstanding data for the year ended September
30, 1996 is unaudited and presented on a pro forma basis as BCC had no publicly
held common shares outstanding prior to its spin-off from USLD on August 2,
1996. The number of weighted average common shares outstanding used in the
calculation of the pro forma earnings per share gives effect to the shares
assumed to be issued had the spin-off occurred at the beginning of each period
presented. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and the
denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations for net income                                FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

Certain options to purchase 5,829,260 shares of common stock at prices
ranging from $13 to $29 per share were outstanding for a portion of 1998. They
were not included in the computation of the diluted EPS because the options'
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares.
New Accounting Standards
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
AICPA issued Statement of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, which provides guidance on when revenue should be recognized and
in what amounts for licensing, selling, leasing or otherwise marketing computer
software. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1997 and is to be applied prospectively. In March
1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-4, Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision
of SOP 97-2. SOP 98-4 defers for one year the application of certain provisions
of SOP 97-2. Management of the Company does not anticipate that the adoption of
SOP 97-2 and SOP 98-4 will have a material impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, which establishes standards for reporting information about
operating segments in annual and interim financial statements. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. SFAS No. 131 supersedes SFAS No. 14,
Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise. Generally, financial
information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally
for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to
segments. SFAS No. 131 is effective for financial statements for periods
beginning after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 131 need not be applied to interim
financial statements in the initial year of its application, but comparative
information for interim periods in the initial year of application is to be
reported in financial statements for interim periods in the second year of
application.                    37

The Company has various fixed rate term notes with rates ranging from
762% to 773%, due in varying amounts through June 2002. The proceeds from the
issuance of these notes were used to acquire certain computer equipment and
office furniture. The loans are secured by the assets acquired.
In December 1996, the Company obtained a $500 million revolving line
of credit facility with certain lenders primarily to draw upon to advance funds
to its billing customers prior to collection of the funds from the local
telephone companies. This credit facility terminates on December 20, 1999.
Borrowings under the credit facility are limited to a portion of the Company
eligible receivables. Management believes that the capacity under the credit
facility will be sufficient to fund advances to its billing customers for the
foreseeable future. No amounts were borrowed by the Company under its credit
facility to finance the advance funding program at either September 30, 1998 or
1997. At September 30, 1998, the amount available under the Company credit
facility was $500 million. Additionally, at September 30, 1997, the Company had
a $12 million letter of credit outstanding.
Under the most restrictive terms of the Company credit agreements,
the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock, is required
to comply with certain financial covenants and is subject to certain limitations
on the issuance of additional secured debt. The Company was in compliance with
all such covenants at September 30, 1998.                    38

with an officer/director of the Company see Note 12. Rental expense for the
years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, was $2,456,000, $1,630,000 and
$726,000, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable

40 NOTE 5. ACQUISITIONS
In September 1998, the Company acquired 22% of the capital stock of PTC
for $10 million. PTC was a privately held company located in Princeton, New
Jersey specializing in electronic bill publishing over the Internet and advanced
payment solutions. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity
method of accounting. In addition, the Company acquired the right of first
refusal for a period of five years to provide any future equity or debt
financing for PTC.
Effective June 1, 1997, the Company acquired Computer Resources
Management, Inc. CRM, a company that develops software systems for the
direct billing of telecommunications services. This acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of operations for CRM have
been included in the Company consolidated financial statements, and the shares
related to the acquisition have been included in the weighted average shares
outstanding for purposes of calculating net income per common share since the
date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect
to the acquisition of CRM as if it had occurred at the beginning of the periods
presented. The unaudited pro forma information is based on the historical
information for the periods presented and includes adjustments to reflect the
special charge resulting from expensing acquired in-process research and
development costs see Note 6 and the effect on depreciation and amortization
expense of recording the fair value of assets acquired. The number of weighted
average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the pro forma per share
data gives effect to the shares assumed to be issued had the acquisition
occurred at the beginning of each period presented.                                          YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

of the operating results that would have occurred had the acquisition actually
taken place at the beginning of the periods specified or that the Company will
achieve in the future because, among other things, this information is based on
historical rather than prospective information and includes certain assumptions
which are subject to change. The unaudited pro forma financial information
reflects, in management opinion, all adjustments necessary to fairly state the
pro forma operating results for the periods presented to make the unaudited pro
forma financial information not misleading.
An aggregate of $85 million cash and 650,000 shares of the Company
common stock were issued in connection with this purchase transaction. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired
was determined through an independent appraisal and amounted to approximately
$175 million, of which approximately $12 million was recorded as goodwill and
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years. In addition 130 million was recorded as in-process research and development expenses see
Note 6. The remaining balance was recorded as the purchase price for a customer
list and other intangibles, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over periods ranging from six to twelve years.
In December 1998, the Company completed the merger of Communications
Software Consultants, Inc. CommSoft in consideration of 2,492,759 shares of
the Company common stock. CommSoft was a privately held, international
software development and consulting firm specializing in the telecommunications
industry see Note 14.                    40
41 NOTE 6. SPECIAL CHARGES
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company recognized
special charges in the amount of $20 million. The $20 million charge
represented the in-process research and development costs acquired in connection
with the acquisition of 22% of the capital stock of PTC see Note 5.
During the third quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recognized special
charges in the amount of $213 million. The $213 million charge included
in-process research and development costs of $130 million acquired in
connection with the acquisition of CRM see Note 5. At the date of acquisition,
the technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not yet been
established, and the technology had no future alternative uses. The remaining
$83 million charge represented accumulated costs associated with the
development of a direct billing system for a service bureau operation. This
development was abandoned by the Company.
NOTE 7. SHARE CAPITAL
On July 10, 1996, the Company, upon authorization by its Board of
Directors, adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan Rights Plan and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each share of its outstanding
common stock. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company common stock or announces a tender offer, the
consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or
more of the Company common stock. These rights, which expire on July 10, 2006,
entitle stockholders to buy one ten-thousandth of a share of a new series of
participating preferred shares at a purchase price of $130 per one
ten-thousandth of a preferred share. The Rights Plan was designed to ensure that
stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed
takeover of the Company.
On August 2, 1996, USLD distributed 30,064,002 shares of the Company
common stock to the existing stockholders of USLD in order to effect the
spin-off of BCC from USLD. Prior to August 2, 1996, BCC operated as a wholly
owned subsidiary of USLD and, consequently, had no publicly owned common shares.
No dividends were paid on the Company common stock during fiscal 1998, 1997 or
1996.
NOTE 8. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS
Prior to the Distribution, the Company adopted the BCC 1996 Employee
Comprehensive Stock Plan Comprehensive Plan and the BCC 1996 Non-Employee
Director Plan Director Plan under which officers and employees, and
non-employee directors, respectively, of the Company and its affiliates are
eligible to receive stock option grants. Employees of the Company also are
eligible to receive restricted stock grants under the Comprehensive Plan. The
Company has reserved 10,500,000 and 800,000 shares of its common stock for
issuance pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan and Director Plan, respectively.
Under each plan, options vest and expire pursuant to individual award
agreements; however, the expiration date of unexercised options may not exceed
ten years from the date of grant under the Comprehensive Plan and five and seven
years for automatic and discretionary grants, respectively, under the Director
Plan. Immediately prior to the Distribution, the Company granted, under the
Comprehensive Plan and Director Plan, respectively, options to purchase BCC
common stock to each holder of an outstanding option to purchase shares of USLD
common stock under the USLD Employee Stock Option Plan and the USLD Non-Employee
Director Plan, respectively. The BCC options are exercisable for BCC common
stock on the basis of one share of BCC common stock for every one share of USLD
common stock subject to the outstanding USLD options. BCC options to purchase a
total of 3,143,008 shares of BCC common stock were granted in connection with
the adjustment to the USLD options. In connection with the grant of the BCC
options, the exercise price of the USLD options was adjusted to preserve the
economic value of the USLD options existing immediately prior to the
Distribution after giving effect to the grant of the BCC options. The BCC
options will have vesting schedules mirroring the vesting schedules of the
related USLD options. Each BCC option granted in connection with the
Distribution will terminate in accordance with the original USLD option grant.                    41

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, but has elected to apply Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans as allowed under SFAS
No. 123. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized compensation expense for
stock options granted where the exercise price is equal to the market price of
the underlying stock at the date of the grant. During fiscal 1998, 1997 and
1996, the Company recognized $726,000, $540,000 and $10,000, respectively, of
compensation expense for options granted below the market price of the
underlying stock on such measurement date. In addition, in accordance with the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, the Company has not recognized compensation
expense for employee stock purchases under the Billing Concepts Corp. Employee

granted during the year ended September 30, 1997 where the exercise price was
below the market price of the underlying stock at the grant date were $448 and
$1300, respectively. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated
fair value of options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting periods.
Warrants to purchase 450,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $463 per share were granted during fiscal 1996 immediately prior to
the Distribution to each holder of a warrant to purchase shares of USLD common
stock and had a weighted average fair value of $601. The fair value for these
warrants was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with an expected volatility of 25%, an expected dividend yield of 0%, an
expected life of 2 years and a risk-free interest rate of 609% as the
weighted-average assumptions. Warrants to purchase 201,252 and 175,354 shares of
common stock were exercised in fiscal 1998 and 1997, respectively. There were no
warrants exercised in fiscal 1996.                    43

The Company was notified by the Internal Revenue Service IRS that a
fiscal 1992 transaction between a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of USLD Mega
Plus Dialing, Inc. and the Company is proposed to be treated differently by the

appellate division of the IRS. The appellate division of the IRS agreed with the
Company original treatment of the transaction.
NOTE 10. BENEFIT PLANS

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it
is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which
the Company is a party will have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations; however, due to the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any
particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution
occurred.
The Company is obligated to pay certain local telephone companies a
total of approximately $57 million, $42 million, $41 million, $41 million 40 million, and $71 million during fiscal 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and
thereafter, respectively, for minimum usage charges under billing and collection
agreements that, unless automatically renewed, expire at varying dates through
the end of fiscal 2005. The billing and collection agreements do not provide for
any penalties other than payment of the obligation should the usage levels not
be met. The Company has met all such volume commitments in the past and
anticipates exceeding the minimum usage volumes with all of these vendors.
NOTE 12. RELATED PARTIES

boards of directors through June 2, 1997. Therefore, USLD was considered a
related party for purposes of financial disclosure through this date. The

agreements for these services have been reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements at market prices. Related party transactions

transition, the Company and USLD entered into certain agreements. Such
agreements include: i the Distribution Agreement, providing for, among other

certain assets and liabilities and material indemnification provisions; ii the
Benefit Plans and Employment Matters Allocation Agreement, providing for certain

Billing and Information Management Services Agreement, and the
Telecommunications Agreement reflect terms and conditions similar to those that
would have been arrived at by independent parties bargaining at arm length;
however, there can be no assurances that such agreements are on terms at least
as favorable as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.
