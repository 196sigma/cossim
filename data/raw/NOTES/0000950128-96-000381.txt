flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1996, in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business
FORE Systems, Inc. FORE or the Company designs, develops,
manufactures and sells high-performance networking products based on
Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM technology. ATM is the international
standard that was developed by the telecommunications industry to support
broadband multimedia applications transmitted over high-speed networks.
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The consolidated financial data contained herein include the accounts of
ALANTEC Corporation ALANTEC for all periods presented see Note 2. The
Company fiscal year ends March 31. Any reference to years stated hereafter
represents the fiscal year unless otherwise indicated. 
On May 6, 1996, the Company Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
common stock split effected in the form of a common stock dividend paid on June
3, 1996 to stockholders of record on May 20, 1996. All share and per-share data
for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the
stock split.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped provided that all
significant obligations are fulfilled. Revenue from support contracts is
recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements. Revenue from
initial license fees, including limited warranty services, is recognized upon
the delivery of the software and the costs associated with providing such
services, which are immaterial, are accrued.
Development contract and grant revenue arises from agreements entered
into with various governmental agencies and commercial entities for the
research and development of ATM technology and its application to networks.
Revenue on these contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis or
as hours and costs are incurred and billed at stipulated rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
The Company policy is to invest its excess cash in U.S. Government
securities, interest-bearing deposits with major banks, municipal notes and
bonds and commercial paper of companies with strong credit ratings that are
subject to minimal credit and market risk. Cash equivalents consist of money
market funds, commercial paper and municipal notes and bonds which have
original maturities of 90 days or less. Short-term investments include
securities purchased with an original maturity of greater than 90 days.
In 1995, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS 115, on a prospective basis. The Company has classified
all of its short-term investments at March 31, 1996 and 1995 as available for
sale. In accordance with                    30
31
SFAS 115, securities available for sale are recorded at fair market value and
any unrealized gains or losses are recorded as part of stockholders' equity.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out method.
Capitalized Software Development Costs
Software development costs for new software and enhancements to
existing software are expensed as incurred until the establishment of
technological feasibility. Subsequent to establishment of technological
feasibility, the Company capitalizes software development costs incurred until
the product is available for general release to customers. Capitalized software
development costs are amortized to cost of sales on a product-by-product basis
over the estimated lives of the related products. Unamortized capitalized
software development costs of $280 and $589 are included in prepaid expenses
and other current assets at March 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Fixed Assets
Equipment and furniture are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets which range
up to 5 years. Leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and amortized over
the shorter of the estimated lives of the related assets or the term of the
lease.
Warranty Reserve
The Company provides a warranty generally for up to fifteen months on
its products. Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is
recognized and are charged to cost of sales.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS
109, which requires an asset and liability approach in accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
established to reflect the future tax consequences, utilizing enacted tax
rates, of temporary differences between the tax bases and financial bases of
assets and liabilities.
Foreign Currency
The functional currency for the Company foreign operations is the
U.S. dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities of the Company foreign
operations are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect as of
the balance sheet date, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities are translated
at historical exchange rates. Results of operations are translated at the
average exchange rates for the period. Foreign exchange gains and losses, which
are immaterial, are included in the results of operations.
Financial Instruments
The Company uses forward currency exchange contracts on a limited
basis to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and does not use them for
trading purposes. The exposure to credit risk for these contracts is minimal
since they are with major financial institutions. These contracts' terms range
from one month to two years and are entered to hedge certain firm purchase
commitments denominated in those currencies. At March 31, 1996                    31
32
and 1995, the Company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to
buy $171 and $171, respectively, and to sell $0 and $72, respectively.
At March 31, 1996, the Company had an outstanding forward treasury
agreement. The Company entered into this agreement to reduce the impact of
changes in interest rates on future lease expense for the new facilities see
Note 14. The interest rate fluctuations will result in a receipt or
disbursement of funds by the Company upon termination of the agreement on July
31, 1997. The amount exchanged will be amortized over the term of the lease.
Net Income per Common Share
Net income per common share is calculated based on the weighted
average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during
the year. For 1994, a pro forma calculation has been used pursuant to
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 83, in which
certain common and common equivalent shares issued by the Company subsequent to
March 31, 1993 have been included in the calculation of weighted average
shares, using the treasury stock method and the initial public offering price,
as if these shares were outstanding for all of 1994. Additionally, outstanding
shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock which were issued
prior to March 31, 1993 and which converted into common stock upon consummation
of the offerings, are treated as if converted into common stock as of March 31,
1993. Historical net income per share, without giving effect to the
above-described treatment of common and common equivalent shares issued by the
Company subsequent to March 1, 1993 and the conversion of the preferred stock,
was $08 in 1994.
Advertising
Advertising costs are charged to operations when incurred. The Company
did not incur any costs associated with direct response advertising in 1996 and
1995, and there were no capitalized advertising costs at March 31, 1996 and
1995. Advertising expense for 1996, 1995 and 1994 was $5,314, $2,693 and
$1,273, respectively.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year financial statement presentation.
2.    BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
ALANTEC Corporation
On February 23, 1996, the Company consummated the acquisition of
ALANTEC. ALANTEC designs, develops, manufactures and sells intelligent
switching hubs for the Ethernet and Fiber Distributed Data Interface local area

The Company issued 11,213,802 shares of its common stock in exchange for all of
the outstanding shares of ALANTEC common stock. Effective upon the consummation
of the acquisition, all outstanding stock options to purchase shares of ALANTEC
common stock were assumed by the Company and deemed to constitute options to

price, an equivalent number of shares of the Company common stock.
Accordingly, the Company reserved 1,800,070 shares of common stock for issuance
to holders of options formerly exercisable for shares of ALANTEC common stock.
Merger-related expenses of approximately $27 million were expensed

stock resulting in an increase to common stock of $2,248,000 in exchange for
all of the outstanding shares of CAT. This business combination has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests. In connection with this business
combination, the Company incurred merger-related expenses of approximately
$690,000 which consist primarily of fees to financial advisors, legal and
accounting fees, facility consolidation costs and other related expenses.
During the quarter ended June 30, 1995, the Company acquired Applied
Network Technology, Inc. ANT, a developer of Ethernet switches, and
RainbowBridge Communications, Inc. RCI, a developer of routing software.
The Company issued an aggregate of 1,932,838 shares of its common stock
resulting in an increase to common stock of $780,000 in exchange for all of
the outstanding shares of ANT and RCI. The Company also reserved 728,404
additional shares of common stock for issuance to holders of options formerly
exercisable for shares of ANT common stock. Each of these business combinations
has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. In connection with these
business combinations, the Company incurred merger-related expenses of
approximately $16 million which consist of fees to financial advisors, legal
and accounting fees and other related expenses.
The aggregated historical results of operations and financial position
of CAT, ANT and RCI are not material to the Company consolidated financial
statements and prior period amounts have, therefore, not been restated.
Accordingly, retained earnings have been adjusted as of the beginning of fiscal
1996, to reflect the aggregate accumulated deficit of ANT and RCI of $574,000,
and as of the beginning of fiscal 1996, to reflect the accumulated deficit of
CAT of $453,000. The aggregate revenue and earnings of CAT, ANT and RCI for
fiscal years 1995 and 1994 are immaterial in comparison to the revenue and
earnings reported by the Company for those periods.                    33

In December 1995, the Company entered into agreements to lease
headquarters and operating facilities to be constructed on land which was
purchased by the Company. The lessor and an additional lender have committed to
fund up to a maximum of $41 million for the construction of the buildings. The
Company will lease the facilities under a ten-year operating lease and has
options to renew the lease for two additional five-year terms. Future annual
minimum rental payments under the lease are approximately $35 million and are
expected to commence in fiscal 1997. During the construction period, the
Company has guaranteed the repayment of up to approximately $37 million of the
lessor construction financing for the facilities.
Accordingly, as part of the above lease transaction, the Company
pledged $43 million, at March 31, 1996, of securities it holds as collateral
for specified obligations of the lessor. In addition, under the terms of the
lease, the Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants
including the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth. Other restrictive
covenants limit indebtedness and the payment of dividends.                    38

The Company may, at its option, purchase the facilities during or at
the expiration of the term of the lease at an amount equal to the remaining
balance of any debt of the lessor related to the construction of the facilities
plus any applicable prepayment penalties. If the Company does not exercise the
purchase option at the end of the lease, the Company will guarantee the
residual value of the facilities of approximately $24 million, an amount which
was determined at the lease inception date.
The Company has purchased additional option property by issuing a note
that is secured by a mortgage that encumbers the option property. The note of
$614 is included in other current liabilities. The Company also has operating
lease agreements relating to certain other facilities and equipment which
expire at various dates. Rent expense on operating leases for the years ended
March 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 was $5,167, $2,671 and $969, respectively. Future
minimum payments under all non-cancelable operating leases as of March 31, 1996
are summarized as follows                                 Operating

In April 1994, ALANTEC was notified that in March 1994 two founders
and one former employee of ALANTEC filed a lawsuit against certain former
directors, a former officer and several stockholders of ALANTEC Defendants,
seeking damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by the Defendants in
the course of various                    39
40
transactions in which ALANTEC obtained additional financing in exchange for the
issuance of convertible preferred stock. While ALANTEC was not named as a
defendant in the suit, ALANTEC bylaws and indemnification agreements between
ALANTEC and certain of the Defendants require the Company to fund certain
ongoing legal fees associated with defending the suit on behalf of the
Defendants. For the year ended March 31, 1996, the Company incurred $360 for
litigation expenses related to these matters. While the Company expects to
continue to incur legal expenses with respect to the litigation, the Company
believes that the ultimate resolution of the litigation will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of
operations. The lawsuit is in the discovery stage and a trial has been
scheduled for September 1996.                    40
