1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Metals USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Metals USA was founded on July
3, 1996 to become a leading national value-added metals processor service
center, to manufacture higher-value components from processed metals and to
pursue aggressively the consolidation of the highly fragmented metals processing
industry. Prior to its initial public offering IPO, Metals USA had conducted
no operations. Concurrent with the consummation of its IPO on July 11, 1997,
Metals USA acquired, in separate transactions the Mergers eight companies
the Founding Companies engaged in the processing of steel, aluminum and
specialty metals, as well as the manufacture of metal components. Following the
IPO and through December 31, 1998, Metals USA acquired numerous additional metal
processing companies and businesses See Note 2. Certain of the companies
acquired after the IPO were accounted for using the pooling-of-interests
method, resulting in a restatement of the Company financial statements for all
periods presented See Note 2. References herein to the Company include
Metals USA and its subsidiaries.
The Company sells to businesses such as the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. The Company believes that its broad
customer base and its wide array of metals processing capabilities, products and
services, coupled with its broad geographic coverage of the United States,
reduce the Company susceptibility to economic fluctuations affecting any one
industry or geographical area.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, ii the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial
statements are published and iii the reported amount of revenues and expenses
recognized during the periods presented. The Company reviews all significant
estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis
and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication.
Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved
information not previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such
estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial
statements.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -- The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Metals USA and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years' financial statements to
be consistent with the current year presentation.
INVENTORIES -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Certain
of the Company subsidiaries use the last-in first-out LIFO method of
accounting for inventories and other subsidiaries use a variety of methods
including specific identification, average cost and the first-in first-out
FIFO method of accounting. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, approximately
295% and 474%, respectively, of the consolidated inventories were accounted
for using the LIFO method of accounting.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method at rates based upon the estimated useful lives of the various classes of
assets.
32
METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
GOODWILL -- Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair
value of identifiable assets of the businesses acquired using the purchase
method of accounting. Goodwill is stated at cost, net of accumulated
amortization, and is being amortized over a forty-year life using the
straight-line method. The Company reviews the recoverability of goodwill and
other long-lived assets including other intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the asset may be impaired. The Company has not recorded any impairment losses
with respect to goodwill, other long-lived assets or other intangible assets as
of December 31, 1998 and 1997. Accumulated amortization totaled $68 and $12 as
of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Amortization expense for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $56, $12 and $0, respectively.
OTHER ASSETS -- Other assets include deferred financing costs and other
intangible assets, which are being amortized over the estimated useful life of
the related borrowing or intangible asset. Accumulated amortization of other
assets totaled $24 and $11 as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -- The carrying values of cash, accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. The fair value of the
long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates for the same or similar debt
offered to the Company having the same or similar remaining maturities and
collateral requirements. At December 31, 1998, the fair value of the Company
fixed rate long-term debt of $2366 was $2267. The carrying amount of the
Company variable rate long-term debt of $2700 approximates fair value.
INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS -- The Company has entered into interest rate
swap agreements to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce exposure
to interest rate fluctuations. Such agreements involve the exchange of amounts
based on fixed interest rates for amounts based on variable interest rates over
the life of the agreement without an exchange of the notional amount upon which
payments are based. The differential to be paid or received as interest rates
change is accounted for on the accrual method of accounting. The related amount
payable or receivable from counterparties is included as an adjustment to
accrued interest in other accrued liabilities. In the event of early
extinguishment, any gain or loss would be recognized in income at the time of
extinguishment. At December 31, 1998, the fair value of the interest rate swap
agreements was $2.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK -- Financial instruments, which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of
cash deposits, trade accounts and notes receivable. Concentrations of credit
risk with respect to trade accounts are within the machining, furniture,
transportation equipment, power and process equipment, industrial/commercial
construction, consumer durables and electrical equipment industries, and
machinery and equipment manufacturers. Generally, credit is extended once
appropriate credit history and references have been obtained. Adjustments to the
allowance for doubtful accounts are made periodically as circumstances warrant
based upon the expected collectibility of all such accounts. The Company
periodically reviews the credit history of its customers and generally does not
require collateral for the extension of credit.
INCOME TAXES -- The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 SFAS No. 109, ACCOUNTING
FOR INCOME TAXEs. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes are recognized for
the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and
statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are
expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Provision for income taxes represents the amount of taxes payable and the
applicable changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME -- In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS No.
130 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SFAS No. 130 establishes rules for the reporting of
comprehensive income and its components, including foreign currency translation
adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and
equity securities and minimum pension liability adjustments. The Company adopted
SFAS No. 130 for the year ended December 31, 1998, however, the adoption of this
statement had no impact on the Company net income or stockholders' equity.

EARNINGS PER SHARE -- In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS No.
128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 128 which simplifies
the standards required under current accounting rules for computing earnings per
share and replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share and fully
diluted earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share
Earnings per Share and diluted earnings per share Earnings per Share Assuming Dilution. Earnings per Share excludes dilution and is determined by
dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Earnings per Share -- Assuming
Dilution reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities and
other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock. Earnings per Share -- Assuming Dilution is computed similarly to fully
diluted earnings per share under previous accounting rules.
The number of shares used in the per share calculations consists of the

to choose between the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock
options or similar equity instruments and the intrinsic, value-based method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No.

METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Prior to the acquisition by Metals USA, the shareholders of Wayne and Krohn
had elected to be taxed as S Corporations; accordingly, any federal income tax
liabilities for the periods prior to the acquisition dates were the
responsibility of the respective stockholders. For the purposes of these
consolidated financial statements, federal income taxes have been provided as if
Wayne and Krohn had filed C Corporation tax returns for the pre-acquisition
periods, with the current income tax provisions reflected in the consolidated
financial statements as increases to additional paid-in capital. Collectively,
Metals USA issued 9,490,458 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the
capital stock of Jeffreys, Wayne and Krohn. The unaudited aggregate
pre-acquisition net sales and net income for Jeffreys, Wayne and Krohn during
1997 were $2399 and $89, respectively. The unaudited aggregate pre-acquisition
net sales and net income for Krohn during 1998 were $135 and $9, respectively.
There were no transactions between Metals USA, Jeffreys, Wayne or Krohn during
periods prior to these business combinations.
PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS
Concurrent with the completion of its IPO on July 11, 1997, Metals USA
acquired the eight Founding Companies, which are in the metal processing and

BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY
Concurrent with the IPO, the Company obtained an initial $1500 unsecured
revolving credit facility the Original Credit Facility which was used to
fund acquisitions, refinance certain indebtedness of the acquired companies and
for general corporate and working capital requirements. In January 1998, the
Company obtained a $500 unsecured revolving credit facility the Interim
Credit Facility to meet its acquisition related cash requirements pending the
completion of an extension and modification of the Original Credit Facility to
provide for up to $3000 of borrowing availability. The closing of the extension
and modification of the $3000 credit facility the Credit Facility on
February 11, 1998 stipulated the termination of the Interim Credit Facility. On
November 25, 1998 the Company further amended the Credit Facility to provide for
borrowings of $3500. On December 31, 1998, the Company had $800 million of
borrowing availability under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility matures in February 2003, bears interest at the bank
prime rate or LIBOR, at Metals USA option, plus an applicable margin based on
the ratio of funded debt to cash flows as defined. An annual commitment fee is
payable on any unused portion of the Credit Facility. The commitment fee varies
between 1/2% and 1/4% per annum, based on certain leverage ratios as defined in
the agreement. The Company will use the Credit Facility to fund acquisitions,
make capital expenditures, refinance debt of the companies acquired and for
general working capital requirements. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are
guaranteed by each of the Company material subsidiaries as defined and
secured by the pledge of all of the capital stock of such subsidiaries.

METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
The Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various affirmative
and negative covenants including: i the maintenance of certain financial
ratios, ii restrictions on additional indebtedness, iii restrictions on
liens, guarantees and dividends, iv obtaining the lenders' consent with
respect to certain individual acquisitions, and v maintenance of a specified
level of consolidated net worth. At December 31, 1998, the Company was precluded
from the payment of dividends under the terms of the Credit Facility.
The Company has entered into two interest rate swap agreements designed as a
partial hedge to the Company variable rate borrowings under the Credit
Facility. The purpose of these swap agreements is to fix interest rates on a
portion of its borrowings under the Credit Facility, thereby reducing exposure
to interest rate fluctuations. At December 31, 1998, the Company had interest
rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $1250 compared to the total
borrowings under the Credit Facility of $2700. Under these agreements, the
Company will pay the counterparties interest at a weighted average fixed rate of
508% and the counterparties will pay the Company interest at a variable rate
equal to LIBOR. The weighted average LIBOR rate applicable to these agreements
was 526% at December 31, 1998. The notional amounts do not represent amounts
exchanged by the parties, and thus are not a measure of exposure of the Company.
The weighted average variable rates are subject to change over time based on
fluctuations in the 90 day LIBOR rate. Terms for the agreements expire on
November 30, 2000 and December 4, 2000.
Neither the Company nor the counterparties, which are prominent financial
institutions, are required to collateralize their respective obligations under
these agreements. The Company is exposed to loss if one or both of the
counterparties default. At December 31, 1998, the Company had no exposure to
credit loss on the interest rate swaps. The Company does not believe that any
reasonably likely change in interest rates would have a material adverse effect
on the financial position, the results of operations or cash flows of the
Company.
8 5/8% SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES
On February 11, 1998, the Company completed the sale of $2000 aggregate
principal amount of the Company 8 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 the
Notes. The Company received $1945 of net cash proceeds before expenses of
$8 at closing. The Company used $1793 of such proceeds to repay all the
borrowings outstanding under the Original Credit Facility and Interim Credit
Facility on February 11, 1998.
The Notes call for semi-annual interest payments on February 15 and August 15
of each year, beginning August 15, 1998 and mature on February 15, 2008. The
Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after February 15, 2003, at the following redemption prices: 2003 104313%; 2004 -- 102875%; 2005 -- 101438%; thereafter -- 10000%, together
with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time on or prior to February 15, 2001, the Company may redeem
up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes originally issued with
the net proceeds of one or more offerings of the common stock of the Company, at
a redemption price equal to 108625% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such redemption; provided that at
least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes originally issued remains
outstanding immediately after such redemption. The Notes are guaranteed by
substantially all of the Company current and future subsidiaries.
Additionally, the indenture governing the Notes contains customary restrictions
relating to additional indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates, asset
sales, investments, restricted payments and mergers and acquisitions of
subsidiaries. The Notes are subordinate to borrowings under the Credit Facility
and will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all other future subordinated
debt of the Company and will rank senior to other indebtedness that expressly
provides that it is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes.
VARIOUS ISSUES OF INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
The Industrial Revenue Bonds the IRBs are payable in installments ranging
from monthly to annual with variable interest ranging from 305% to 598% per
annum at December 31, 1998 and mature from March 1, 2003 to May 1, 2023. The
IRBs are secured by real estate and equipment acquired with proceeds from these
bonds with a net book value of $287 at December 31, 1998. The IRBs place
various restrictions on certain of the Company

anniversary of date of grant and will expire ten years from the date of grant or
three months following termination of employment. The Company did not issue any
stock options prior to January 1, 1996. Options granted in 1996 were

purchase 10,000 shares, ii the automatic grant to each non-employee director
of an option to purchase 10,000 shares upon such person initial election as a
director and iii an automatic annual grant at each annual meeting of
stockholders thereafter of an option to purchase 5,000 shares to each
non-employee director at which meeting such director is re-elected or remains a
director, unless such annual meeting is held within three months of such
person initial election as a director. All options will have an exercise price
per share equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of
grant and are immediately vested and expire on the earlier of ten years from the
date of grant or one year after termination of service as a director. The
Directors' Plan also permits non-employee directors to elect to receive, in lieu
of cash directors' fees, shares or credits representing deferred shares at
future settlement dates, as selected by the director. The number of shares or
deferred shares received will equal the number of shares of Common Stock which,
at the date the fees would otherwise be payable, will have an aggregate fair
market value equal to the amount of such fees.

At December 31, 1998, exercisable options for shares of Common Stock were
595,600 at a weighted average price of $1163 per share.
The Company used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the estimated
fair-value of stock options and similar awards. The model requires the use of
a number of subjective assumptions including: i risk free rate of return, ii
expected price volatility of the Common Stock, iii expected dividend yield and
iv estimated life of the option. Principal assumptions used in estimating the
fair-value of the Company stock options using the Black-Scholes model were
as follows                               DECEMBER 31,
1998      1997
Risk free rate of return..      591%      618%
Expected price volatility..     4606%      433%
Expected dividend yield..      --        Expected life of the option in years..      75       75
The Company applies APB No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option
plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant rate, consistent
with the methodology prescribed under the SFAS No. 123, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced by the amortization of the
estimated fair value of stock options over the applicable vesting period of such
awards. The following pro forma disclosures may not be representative of similar
future disclosures because: i additional options may be granted in future
years and ii the computations used to estimate the fair value of the stock
options are subject to significant subjective assumptions, any one or all of
which may differ in material respects from actual amounts.

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
PROFIT-SHARING PLANS
Certain subsidiaries of the Company provide various defined contributions
savings plans for their employees the Plans. The Plans cover substantially
all full-time employees of such subsidiaries. Participants vest at varying rates
ranging from full vesting upon participation to those that provide for vesting
to begin after three years of service and are fully vested after seven years.
Certain Plans provide for a deferral option that allows employees to elect to
contribute a portion of their pay into the plan and provide for a discretionary
profit sharing contribution by the individual subsidiary. Generally the
subsidiaries match a portion of the amount deferred by participating employees.
Contributions for the profit sharing portion of the plan are generally at the
discretion of the individual subsidiary board of directors. The aggregate
contributions to the Plans were $28, $9 and $3 for the years ended December
31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company is in the process of merging
these separate plans into the Metals USA 401k Plan.
LEVERAGED ESOP ARRANGEMENT
Under the provisions of an employee stock ownership plan ESOP and its
related trust, Jeffreys made annual contributions to the ESOP which were
invested in stock of Jeffreys and other qualifying securities for the benefit of
Jeffreys' employees. The ESOP provided for Jeffreys' purchases of employee
shares to be paid in cash and with the issuance of a note payable. Effective
September 26, 1997, the participation was frozen. Concurrent with the merger
with Metals USA, ESOP shares were exchanged for shares of Metals USA common
stock. The following disclosure has been restated to reflect the equivalent
shares of Metals USA common stock that were issued in connection with the
acquisition of Jeffreys.
Jeffreys' ESOP held 434,616 shares of stock prior to the purchase of 735,384
shares of outstanding stock from a majority stockholder for $531 per share. The
ESOP borrowed the funds to purchase such stock and Jeffreys guaranteed the
repayment of this loan. Jeffreys repaid this loan, plus interest, through
deductible contributions to the plan. As Jeffreys made contributions to the
plan, which reduced the principal on the note, the plan released the
corresponding shares related to the reduction in the note principal. At the
point when these shares were no longer specifically secured by the note payable,
they were allocated to the individual participants of the plan and considered
earned by those employees at that time. Jeffreys accounted for its ESOP in
accordance with Statement of Position 93-6 SOP 93-6, EMPLOYERS' ACCOUNTING
FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP was
recorded as long-term debt and the shares pledged as collateral were reported as
unearned compensation. As shares were released from collateral, Jeffreys
reported compensation expense equal to estimated market price of the shares at
that time. ESOP share compensation expense was $26, $4 and $6 for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Since the obligation was secured by the shares purchased and the note was
guaranteed by Jeffreys, all amounts relating to this transaction were considered
unearned compensation of the employees until such time as the note was repaid
and the corresponding shares are released to the individual participants of the
plan. The balance in unearned compensation at December 31, 1997 of $15 results
from the leveraged ESOP stock purchase less the deemed release of shares at
cost. With the termination of the ESOP in August 1998, subsequent to the payment
of the note to Jeffreys and the distribution of the ESOP shares to the
individual participants, all unearned compensation was charged to expense in
1998.

METALS USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
CONTINGENCIES
The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in a variety of claims,
lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. The
Company believes the resolution of these matters and the incurrence of their
related costs and expenses should not have a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
14. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions with directors, officers, employees including affiliates of the
foregoing or affiliates of the Company must be at terms that are no less
favorable to the Company than those available from third parties and must be
approved in advance by a majority of disinterested members of the Board of
Directors.
In connection with the Mergers and certain of the subsequent acquisitions,
subsidiaries of the Company have entered into a number of lease arrangements for
facilities and equipment. These lease arrangements are for periods ranging from
10 to 20 years. Lease payments for these items with respect to years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were $31, $14 and $3, respectively. Future
commitments in respect of these leases are included in the schedule of minimum
lease payments in Note 13.
At December 31, 1998 and 1997 the aggregate principal amount of notes
receivable held by the Company were $7 and $8, respectively. Interest accrues
on the notes at rates ranging from 75% to 80% per annum. The notes call for
regular periodic payments of principal and interest and mature at varying dates
through March 1, 2007. The notes are secured by liens on specific assets of the
affiliates and personnel guarantees of the individuals. As of December 31, 1998,
the notes were current as to payment terms.
15. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY
On January 21, 1999, the Company entered into a three-year agreement the
Receivable Securitization Agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, through
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Metals Receivable Corporation MRC, an undivided
interest in a designated pool of its trade accounts receivable to a commercial
bank Purchaser. The maximum undivided interest in MRC receivable portfolio
that may be purchased pursuant to this agreement is $1000. The Company, as
agent for Purchaser, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for
the participating interests sold. As collections reduce the receivables included
in MRC receivable portfolio, the Company may sell additional undivided
interests in new receivables to MRC. The amount of the undivided interest in
MRC receivable portfolio that is sold typically will change monthly depending
upon the level of defined eligible receivables available for sale each month
adjusted by certain defined ratios. From month to month, the amount by which
MRC receivable portfolio exceeds the undivided interest purchased will vary.
The Company expects such amount will range between $200 and $300. The
unpurchased portion of the MRC receivable portfolio is effectively collateral
for the benefit of the Purchaser.
In connection with the initial sale pursuant to the Receivable Securitization
Agreement in January, 1999, MRC sold an undivided interest in the first $930 in
its aggregate receivable portfolio of $1170. The proceeds from this sale were
used to reduce borrowings under the Company Credit Facility.
