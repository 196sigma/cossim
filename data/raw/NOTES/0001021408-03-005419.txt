Years Ended December 29, 2002, December
30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 Note
1.Business and Significant Accounting Policies Business.Hall, Kinion Associates, Inc. the Company is a staffing company specializing in placing high technology and corporate professional personnel
on both a contract and permanent basis. Fiscal Year.The Companys fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2000 consisted of 53 weeks. Principles of Consolidation.The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Fair Value of Financial Instruments.The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturity of these instruments. The book value of the Companys debt instrument is considered to approximate its fair value because the interest rate of this instrument
approximates current rates offered to the Company. Cash and Cash Equivalents.The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents, consisting primarily of money
market funds and bank accounts, are stated at a cost which approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.The Companys financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of trade receivables. However, concentrations of risk are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across different business and geographic areas. Accounts
receivable are carried at the amount estimated to be collectible. The Company maintains an allowance for potential losses based upon managements analysis of historical write-off levels, current economic trends, assessment of its
customers financial strength and other known factors affecting collectibility. The ultimate amount of accounts receivable that become uncollectible could differ from those estimated amounts. Significant changes in the allowance are as follows Years Ended December29, 2002 December30, 2001 December31, 2000 in thousands Beginning balance

Property and Equipment.Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to twenty-five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. 
27 HALL, KINION ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets the Company regularly
reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows. Intangible Assets.As of
December 29, 2002, the carrying amount of other identifiable intangibles was $109 million, including $41 million subject to amortization over a five year life and $68 million not subject to amortization. Amortization expense in 2002 was $365,000.
Deferred Rent.The
Company leases certain office facilities under operating leases that provide for increases in rent based on specified amounts. Rent expense associated with these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease and the
difference between the amount charged to expense and the rent paid is recorded as deferred rent. Accrued Compensation.The Company accrues for deferred compensation that it is contractually obligated to pay its Chief Executive Officer. Accrued compensation balances at
December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001 were $1,619,000 and $1,050,000, respectively. Revenue Recognition.Revenue from contract services is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from permanent placement contracts is recognized either upon
commencement of employment or upon completion of services rendered based on contractual obligation. Revenue from online recruiting and placement Web sites is recognized over the term of membership. Income Taxes.The Company
accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. 
28 HALL, KINION ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Stock-Based Compensation.The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and its related FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires the disclosure of proforma net income and
earnings per share. Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of stock-based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option price models, even though models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable
options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ from the Companys stock option awards. These models also require subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise, which affect the
calculated values. The proforma amounts and the assumptions used to calculate them are shown below.  Years Ended December29, 2002 December30, 2001 December31, 2000 Proforma amounts Net income loss As reported

Net
Income Loss Per Share.Basic net income loss per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted net income loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if convertible securities and contracts to issue common stock were converted or exercised into common stock. The number of incremental shares from the
assumed issuance of stock options is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Reclassifications.Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recently Issued Financial Accounting
Standards.In June 2002 SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities was issued. SFAS No. 146 applies to costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly
acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by SFAS No. 144. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 146 for exit or disposal activities, if any, initiated after December 15, 2002. Accordingly, SFAS No.
146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs, if any, as well as amounts recognized.

2.Acquisitions On
August 9, 2002, the Company acquired certain net assets and assumed certain liabilities of OnStaff in exchange for $181 million in cash and 363,057 shares of Hall Kinion common stock, valued at $22 million. The value of the common stock issued was
determined based upon the average market price of the Companys common stock over a 2-day period before and after the August 9, 2002 acquisition. In addition, the Company agreed to pay OnStaff up to $130 million over three years contingent
upon the achievement of certain milestones. OnStaff, a privately-held group of companies that provides temporary and full-time employees in the real estate, finance and healthcare industries, included: OnStaff, Inc., a California corporation
OSI, Healthcare Staffing Resources, Inc., a California corporation HCSR, and Boardnetwork.com, Inc., a California corporation BNI. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the
operations of OnStaff from August 2002. The

3.Amendment to Bank Line of Credit On July 12, 2002, the Company entered into an $180 million revolving credit facility which was due May1, 2004. As of December 29, 2002, there was $10 million outstanding on the bank line of credit at an interest rate of 425%.
The Company was not in compliance with the required financial covenants as of December 29, 2002. On February 3, 2003, the bank waived such financial covenant violations. On March 24, 2003, the Company entered into an amended agreement with the bank
which expires January 1, 2004. Significant terms and conditions of the amended agreement are as follows: Borrowings available are $12,000,000; reduced to $10,000,000 beginning June 15, 2003; and reduced to $9,000,000 beginning September 15, 2003. Total borrowings are
limited to 75% of eligible accounts receivable, reduced to 70% beginning July 15, 2003. 
30 HALL, KINION ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Interest is at prime plus 15%; increased to prime plus 30% beginning June 15, 2003 April 21, 2003 if the Company does not receive a financing proposal from
another acceptable financial lender; and increased to prime plus 50% beginning September 15, 2003. The bank amended financial covenants related to profitability, tangible net worth and cash balances, and specific ratios of working capital and debt to tangible net
worth. Management expects that the Company will be able to remain in compliance with the amended financial covenants through January 1, 2004. Borrowings are collateralized by all of the Companys assets. A bank lock box was established, whereby all Company cash receipts are first applied to the line of credit. The Company has begun to meet and negotiate with other
financial lenders in order to secure replacement financing to replace the amended bank agreement. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure replacement financing on substantially similar terms or at all.

5.Impairment of Goodwill In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business
combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
will not be amortized, but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 in fiscal year 2002 and, in accordance therewith, discontinued the amortization of goodwill effective December 31, 2001. The Company
performed an initial impairment test as required by SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. As of December 29, 2002, the Company performed its annual impairment test. Significant estimates and assumptions were used in determining
the Companys estimated fair value of each reporting unit, including forecasted volume, revenue, level of operating expenses, number of offices and profitability. In 2002 and early 2003, sales and profitability for the Technology Professional Division have declined and on
March 3, 2003, the Company announced a restructuring plan that included closure of 13 offices and termination of 69employees. The restructuring charge, currently estimated to be between $24 million and 
31 HALL, KINION ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 30million, will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Additionally, the Companys market capitalization declined
significantly beginning early in the first quarter of 2003. The closing trading price was $179 per share as of March 26, 2003. As a result, the Company determined, based upon such estimates and assumptions and comparison to the Companys
market capitalization in March 2003, that the estimated fair values of its reporting units were significantly less than the related carrying values as of December 29, 2002. Therefore, following the methodology required under SFAS No142,
goodwill totaling $155 million was written-off as of December29, 2002, resulting in a revised carrying amount of $118million as of that date, all of which was included in the Contract Professional Staffing segment See Note 13.
During the first quarter of 2001, the Company
recorded an impairment charge pursuant to SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, of approximately $267 million to recognize the impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets associated with the following acquisitions: TKI Acquisition Corporation, IC Planet Acquisition Corporation, Huntington Acquisition Corporation, TKO Personnel Inc., and Group-IPEX, Inc. These companies experienced significant declines in
demand for their services, revenues, cash flows, and expected future growth due to declining economic conditions. A reconciliation of previously reported net income loss and diluted income loss per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of
goodwill amortization, net of related income tax effect, follows:  Years Ended December29, 2002 December30, 2001 December31, 2000 in thousands, except per share amounts

6.Restructuring Costs During 2001, the Company decided to close several offices and reduced its workforce. The Company recorded $17,048,000 for severance, lease terminations, and other costs associated with the Companys decision to restructure
operations. In 2002, restructuring income of $6,000 was comprised of $876,000 of income for the favorable resolution of certain severance and sublease agreements, offset by $870,000 of costs resulting from higher than estimated lease termination
payments. The remaining accrued restructuring costs are anticipated to be paid out during fiscal year 2003, except for the rental payments related to long-term facility leases that require settlement after 2003 and are reserved as non-current
restructuring costs. Restructuring liability is as follows:  2001

currently estimated to be between $24 million and $30 million, will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Note 7.Stockholders Equity Capital StockThe Company is authorized to issue 110,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 100,000,000 shares of
common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Stockholder Notes ReceivableIn January 1999, the Company loaned its Chief Executive Officer CEO $2,000,000, which bears interest at the Companys incremental rate of borrowing plus 1/8% per annum 44% at December 29, 2002, compounded monthly. This loan was secured by 1,000,000 shares of the
Companys Common Stock pledged by the CEO. In January 2001, in connection with a revision of the CEOs employment agreement, the note was amended to extend the term to January 1, 2005 and to provide, annually, beginning on January 1, 2001,
that 20% of the principal amount plus accrued interest shall be forgiven, so that on January 1, 2005, no amounts will be due or owing. The amended note is secured by 433,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock pledged by the CEO. As loan
forgiveness due January 1, 2003 was recorded in 2002, the remaining balance of the note as of December 29, 2002 is $800,000. Stock OptionsThe Companys 1997 Stock Option Plan the Plan, as amended, authorizes the issuance of up to
3,759,000 shares of common stock pursuant to incentive or nonqualified stock options granted under the Plan to key employees, non-employees, directors and consultants who provide services to the Company. The Plan also allows an automatic annual
authorization for an additional number of shares equal to 30% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the first day of each calendar year. At December 29, 2002, 142,000 shares of Common Stock were available for issuance under the
plan. Under the Plan, options generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. Such options vest over periods ranging from two to five years and expire up to ten years from the grant date.

8.Net Income Loss per Share Basic net income loss per share is calculated using only the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income loss per share also includes in the calculation the dilution that could occur if convertible
securities and contracts to issue common stock were converted or exercised. In calculating the net loss per share for the years ended December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, 123,000 and 212,000 options, respectively, were excluded because they are antidilutive. For the year
ended December 31, 2000, 88,000 options at prices exceeding market value were excluded from the determination of common stock equivalents for purposes of calculating diluted weighted average shares.

At
December 29, 2002, the Company had gross net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $146million and $332 million for federal income tax purposes and state income tax purposes, respectively, expiring at various dates through 2022.
A valuation allowance is required if management
concludes that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $62 million to reflect the amount of net deferred income taxes management believes is more likely than
not to be realized. In addition, realization of the loss carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management
believes it is more likely than not that the loss carryforwards will be realized. The amount of the loss carryforwards that is considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the
carryforward period are reduced.

Companys financial statements taken as a whole. Note
11.Employee Benefit Plans The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan covering substantially all employees with at least 90 days of continuous service. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation to the maximum amount allowed by the

officers and other key employees. The plan is funded by employee contributions through payroll withholding and employees are fully vested from the start of their participation in the plan. The Company makes no matching contributions to the plan. The
long term deferred compensation liability was $11 million and $13 million at December 29, 2002 and December 30, 2001, respectively, and is included in accrued compensation and deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Employee
contributions are invested through a rabbi trust whose assets Company-owned life insurance policies will be used to pay the benefits if the Company remains solvent, but can be reached by the Companys creditors if the Company
becomes insolvent. Such assets are carried at the cash surrender value of the related insurance policy, were $ 10 million at December 29, 2002 and $13 million at December 30, 2001, and were included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.
