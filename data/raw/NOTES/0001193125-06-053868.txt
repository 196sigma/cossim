CARRIER ACCESS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS in thousands, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Business Operations Carrier Access Corporation the Company designs, manufactures and sells broadband access equipment to wireline and wireless carriers. The
products are used to upgrade capacity and provide enhanced services to wireline and wireless communications networks. The products also enable our customers to offer enhanced voice and data services, delivered over multiple technologies, which
historically have been offered onto separate networks, on a single converged network. The Company designs products to enable our customers to deploy new revenue-generating voice and data services, while lowering their capital expenditures and
ongoing operating costs. The Company operates in one business segment and substantially all of its sales and operations are domestic. Principles of
Accounting and Consolidation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Companys
consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting and reporting certain amounts, including revenue recognition, allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory obsolescence, asset fair
value, product warranty, depreciation, amortization, impairments, stock based compensation, income tax valuation allowance and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash, Cash Equivalents Cash and cash
equivalents include cash balances with banks and all highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Investments The Companys investments include U.S., state and municipal government obligations and domestic
public corporate debt securities. Investments are classified as short-term or long-term based on their original or remaining maturities and whether the securities represent the investment of funds available for current operating needs. All of these
investments are held in the name of the Company at a limited number of financial institutions. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, all
of the Companys investments were marketable securities classified as available for sale and are reported at their fair values based upon quoted market prices as of the reporting date. If these investments are sold at a loss or experience a
decline in value that is not temporary, the loss is recognized in the statement of operations for that period. Unrealized gains or losses that are considered temporary in nature are recorded as a separate component of cumulative other comprehensive
income loss in stockholders equity, net of the related tax effect. Subsequent recoveries in the fair value, if any, are not recognized in the statement of operations, but as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The
specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses recorded in interest income, net. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The decision to extend credit to a customer is a judgment we make on whether we can reasonably expect to collect from our customers, including such factors as
customer credit-worthiness, past history with the customer, current customer industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. We make these assessments before we extend credit and at regular intervals thereafter. If these factors do not
indicate reasonable assurance of collection, revenue, if any is deferred until collection does become reasonably assured, which is generally when the cash is received. The Company establishes and maintains a provision for uncollectible accounts
receivable based on managements review of the aging of the receivable balances, our ongoing assessments of our customers current ability to pay, and current industry and market conditions for our customers. Delinquent customer accounts
are written-off after management has determined the likelihood of collection is not probable. 
38 Table of Contents
Other Receivables Certain of the Companys products are manufactured by other unrelated companies under contractual manufacturing arrangements. We procure and sell
some of the components used in the manufacture of our products to these companies. Other receivables included in prepaid expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of $11 million and $22 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, consisted primarily of amounts due from the sale of these components. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments Reported values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other accrued
liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Estimated fair values of short-term and long-term investments are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. Inventories Inventories are reported at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is based on standard costs that approximate average purchase costs. Market is determined based on net realizable value. The cost of finished goods and work-in-process includes material, labor, certain warehousing and
other allocable manufacturing overhead costs. The Company establishes reserves on inventories when judgments about future demand and market conditions indicate net realizable value is less than cost, or when the related technology is considered
obsolete or if the inventory cannot be used in the manufacture of other products. Property and Equipment Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives
ranging from three to twenty-five years, or the lease term for leasehold improvements. Depreciation expense was $21 million, $27 million and $31 million for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized Software The Company expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in the preliminary project stage and capitalizes purchased internal-use software within
property and equipment. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, which is generally 3 years. Software amortization expense was $06 million , $05 million and $07 million for
the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
Company does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill. Other intangible assets consist of acquired customer-related intangibles and developed product technology. Customer-related intangibles and developed product
technology intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 7 and 5 years, respectively. The Company has one reporting unit
and therefore annual impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the consolidated level. Goodwill is reviewed no less than annually for impairment, or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would indicate it is more likely than not an
impairment has occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, the loss of key
personnel, a change in reportable segments and results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. The assessment of goodwill impairment is a two step process. First, the fair value of the
reporting unit is estimated. This estimate of fair value is based on the best available information as of the assessment date, and may be determined on the basis of analyses of the market capitalization of the Company, comparable company market
valuations, and expected future cash flows. Expectations about future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions, and the rate and extent of that anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired
businesses. If the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the implied fair value of the
reporting units goodwill is determined through allocation of the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a manner similar to a purchase price
allocation. The resulting implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference if the implied goodwill is less. 
39 Table of Contents
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over such useful lives, which range from five
to seven years, and are subject to tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. There were no impairments recorded in the fiscal years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. 
Accounting for Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are
recognized when the future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset are less than the assets carrying value, with the amount of loss measured at fair value based upon discounted estimated cash flows. An asset that
is classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. There were no impairments
of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Revenue Recognition The Companys products are generally sold as part of a contract or distribution agreement. The terms of the contract or distribution agreement,
together with binding purchase orders or other binding documentation taken as a whole, determine the appropriate revenue recognition method. The Company recognizes revenue according to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 Revenue Recognition SAB 104, which amended and was preceded by Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements SAB 101, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, applicable portions of SAB Topic 13, Revenue Recognition, and EITF Issue No.
00-21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Under these guidelines, the Company recognizes revenue from transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or the services have been
provided, the price is fixed and determinable, payment is not contingent on performance of installation or service obligations, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For our products, delivery is considered to occur upon shipment or delivery as
defined in our shipping terms, provided that risk of loss, and if necessary title, has transferred to the customer. For arrangements that include customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized upon the customers acceptance of the product or
service, which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period. The Companys products include both hardware and embedded software. To date, the software embedded in our products has
not been considered more than incidental to the product and does not represent a separate unit of accounting as defined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2 Software Revenue
Recognition SOP 97-2. The Company continues to closely review its contracts and distribution agreements to ensure application of the appropriate revenue recognition method. For contracts or agreements involving delivery of more than one element of product or service, the Company applies the guidelines in FASB Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21. Each deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it is a separate unit of accounting. A separate unit of accounting exists where the
delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any undelivered items, and in cases where the contract or agreement provides a general right of return relative to the
delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and is substantially under the Companys control. Provided fair value exists for all units of accounting, revenue is allocated to each element based on
relative fair values. If fair value exists only for the undelivered elements but not the delivered elements, revenue is allocated to the delivered elements by subtracting the fair value of the undelivered elements from the total amount due from the
customer. Revenue for each element, or unit of accounting, is recognized under the applicable revenue recognition guidance. Fair value for individual elements is determined based on either the stand-alone selling prices for these elements when sold
separately, or on prices of similar, substantially interchangeable elements sold to similar customers. Accordingly, the Company considers that selling prices are appropriate indicators of fair value. The Company makes certain sales through multiple distribution channels, primarily resellers or distributors. Reasonable assurance of collectibility is
assessed based on a number of factors, including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer. If reasonable assurance of collectibility is not met, or if payment is contingent upon resale of the Companys products, and
reliable reporting from our resellers or distributors exists, revenue is recognized when the reseller or distributor sells the product to their customer sell through. If reliable reporting from the reseller or distributor is not
available, revenue recognition is deferred until cash is received. Certain customers have the contractual right to return a limited amount
of products during a limited post sale period after shipment as part of a stock rotation. Generally, under the Companys stock rotation program, three times per year, eligible customers may return on average 15% of unsold
inventories purchased within the prior four-month period, in exchange for an equivalent dollar value of new products. The Company also provides price protection to certain customers. Under the price protection program, generally if the
Company reduces prices, eligible customers are entitled to receive a credit for the difference between the price paid and the new, lower price for on-hand inventory purchased within the 60 days prior to the effective date of the price decrease. The
Company applies the guidance of Statement in Financial Accounting Standards No48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, and the guidance in applicable portions of SAB Topic 13 Revenue
Recognition and reduces revenue by the amount of estimated returns due to stock rotation based upon historical experience. In the event the Company reduces prices and the price reduction results in amounts due to eligible customers, we
record the amounts due by reducing revenues and record a corresponding liability.

Revenue from installation and training services is deferred and recognized over the period the services
are performed. Revenue from maintenance services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the maintenance agreements. During January and February of 2001, the Company provided approximately $13 million of sales credits to its customer WinStar for products that WinStar had purchased, paid for, and returned through stock rotation. In April of 2001, WinStar
voluntarily filed for Chapter 7 federal bankruptcy. On December1, 2004, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company was required by the Bankruptcy Court order to pay the Chapter 7 Trustee for WinStar $135,000 and received an
unconditional release of all claims, actions, liabilities, and debts. In accordance with guidance provided by SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, because the Company was
judicially released by the Bankruptcy Court, the liability was derecognized. The Company recorded the resulting $10 million gain as other income. Advertising Costs The Company engages in a number of marketing activities, including
advertising in selected trade publications, industry trade shows and co-operative advertising with several of its distributors and OEM partners. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The costs for co-operative advertising are accrued and
expensed as the related revenues are recognized. Research and Development Expenditures We expend significant resources on product development, including software that is embedded in our products. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Leased, Sold or Otherwise Marketed specifies the accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate product or as
part of a product or process. Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development and expensed as incurred. To date, the period between the time that technological
feasibility occurs and the general availability of the software embedded in our products has been short, and software development costs incurred after technological feasibility that would otherwise qualify for capitalization have been immaterial.
Accordingly, the Company has not capitalized any software development costs. All other research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. The Companys research and development expense includes direct labor, benefits,
material and facilities costs, depreciation and other allocable indirect overhead costs. We have entered into funded software development
arrangements where we perform software development to enable the embedded software in certain of our products to integrate seamlessly within our customer product offerings. These arrangements are accounted for following the guidelines of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No68, Research and Development Arrangements. Funds are earned as we attain contractual milestones and credited against related research and development expense. Total amounts credited
against research and development expenses were $875,000, $0 and $0 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income
Taxes The Company provides for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No109 Accounting for Income Taxes FAS 109. We recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the year as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year that the differences are expected to effect current taxable income. Valuation allowances are
recorded to reduce the amount of deferred tax assets when, based upon available objective evidence including historical taxable income, the expected reversal of temporary differences, and projections of future taxable income, management cannot
conclude it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share from continuing operations is computed by dividing income or loss from continuing operations by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations reflects the additional dilution, from potential issuances of common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options
outstanding and shares of common stock subject to repurchase. The treasury stock method is used to compute the dilutive effect of options and similar instruments. Potentially dilutive shares, including shares of common stock that are subject to
repurchase, are excluded from the computation of fully-diluted earnings per share from continuing operations when their effect is antidilutive. A

all potentially dilutive securities were anti-dilutive and therefore have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share. The number of shares excluded from computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect is
anti-dilutive totaled 1,506,482 for 2005, and 655,244 for 2004. Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123 SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and EITF
No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services, the Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation plans in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock-Based Compensation, and interpretation of APB Opinion No25, and related interpretations. Stock based compensation related to non-employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options in accordance with
SFAS 123 and its interpretations. Expense associated with stock-based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of each individual award, on a straight-line, pro rata basis as vesting occurs. Consistent with the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123, the following table presents the Companys pro forma earnings loss and diluted earnings
loss per share as if the Company had used the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 for the periods presented in thousands, except per share amounts:  Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 Net income loss 6,632 1,779 1,512 Add back: Stock-based employee compensation expense, as reported 77 5 53 Deduct: Stock-based employee compensation expense, determined under fair value method for all awards 4,639 4,169 1,259 Net income loss 11,194 5,943 306 Income loss per share basic, as reported 019 005 006 Income loss per share diluted, as reported 019 005 006 Income loss per share basic and diluted, as adjusted 032 018 001
The weighted average fair values of options granted during 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $374, $819,
and $361 per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no expected dividends, 103% volatility in 2005, 110% volatility in 2004, and 111% volatility in 2003, expected life of the options of
five years in 2005, 2004 and 2003, and a risk-free interest rate of 42% for 2005, 36% for 2004, and 31% for 2003.

Acceleration of Vesting On December27, 2005, the companys Board of Directors approved acceleration of vesting for all unvested stock options, excluding options held by executive officers and directors, with an exercise price
greater than $705. As a result, options previously awarded to current employees for the purchase of 359,335 shares of the Companys common stock vested immediately. The accelerated options have exercise prices ranging from $706 to $1540. The
weighted average exercise price of these options is $1073. The decision to accelerate the vesting of these options, which the Board of
Directors believes is in the best interest of Carrier Access shareholders and employees, was made primarily to reduce non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in the Companys income statement in future periods upon the
adoption of FASB Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment beginning January1, 2006. In addition, because these options have exercise prices well in excess of current market values, the Company believes that they are not
achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and retention. As a result of these accelerations, the Company expects to
reduce the pre-tax stock option expense it would otherwise be required to record in connection with the accelerated options by approximately $11 million. Beginning January1, 2006, the Company will account for its stock-based compensation plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123R, Share Based Payment
revised. Warranty Costs The
Company provides for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue for the products is recognized. The specific terms and conditions of the warranties vary depending on the specific product sold and the terms of the customer purchase
agreements. In the case of hardware our warranties generally start from the delivery date and continue for up to five years. Software products generally are under warranty for 90 days from the date of shipment. Our warranty liability for our
software is to provide patches and bug fixes that are offered as part of and covered by our standard product warranty. The Company accrues for warranty obligations based on historical experience and estimates of future
warranty costs. Charges and accruals to the warranty liability, which is reported as a component of Other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, during the periods presented, are as follows:  Year Ended December31 2005 2004 2003 Product warranty liability beginning balance 634 410 244 Add: Current year accruals 915 1,361 995 Deduct: Current year charges 840 1,137 829 Product warranty liability ending balance 709 634 410 Reclassifications Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. At March31, 2005, the Company reclassified certain auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents
to short-term investments in marketable securities available for sale as of December31, 2004 and for all prior periods. These investments are highly liquid, variable-rate debt securities. While the underlying security typically has a stated
maturity of 20 to 30 years, the interest rate is reset through Dutch auctions that are held every 7, 28 or 35 days, creating a highly liquid, short-term instrument. The securities trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment due date
at the option of the issuer. Interest is paid at the end of each auction period. The following table summarizes the balance sheet amounts as previously reported and as reclassified in thousands:  Year ended December31 CashandCashEquivalents

In order to conform to the 2005 presentation, the Company also reclassified amounts previously
reported for purchases of investments and proceeds from the sale of investments in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. The reclassifications had the effect of increasing previously reported
cash used by investing activities, with a corresponding decrease in cash and cash equivalents, of $24,175 and $7,100 for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 respectively. The reclassification had no impact on previously reported total
current assets, total assets, working capital or results of operations, and does not affect previously reported cash flows from operating or financing activities. 
43 Table of Contents Comprehensive
Income Loss The Companys
comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss, and unrealized gains or losses on certain securities, including reclassification adjustments. The Company had no other sources of comprehensive income for the years ended 2005, 2004, and
2003. Restructuring Costs Restructuring costs, which include employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, asset impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value. The amounts for restructuring costs are estimated based upon
certain key estimates, including the timing of employees leaving the company, the terms that may be negotiated to exit contractual obligations, and the realizable value of certain assets to be disposed of, among others. The Company entered into a restructuring plan effective December, 2002 designed to improve future operating performance and position the Company for
earnings growth in future periods, consistent with anticipated revenues. Included in this plan were employee termination costs, facility closures or downsizing, and disposal of excess or unused assets. In connection with the restructuring, the
Company accrued $20 million in December, 2002. The Company paid approximately $047 million, $049 million and $10 million of these charges in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company adjusted its accrual for changes in estimates with
respect to subleases of approximately $05 million and $02 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December31, 2005, the accrued
liability associated with the restructuring plan, which is reported as part of Other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, consisted of the following in thousands:  Beginning ReserveBalance

2. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements EITF No03-1 The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments EITF No03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments, provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments.
The new impairment model applies to investments accounted for under the cost or equity method and SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. EITF No03-1 also includes new disclosure
requirements for cost method investments and for all investments for which there is an unrealized loss. In September 2004, the FASB delayed adopting the provisions of EITF 03-1. However, the disclosure requirements remain effective and applicable
disclosures have been included within these financial statements and the related notes to the financial statements. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 03-1 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No151 Inventory Costs Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No151 is an amendment to ARB No43, Chapter 4 that the Company will adopt beginning January1, 2006. The statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage to require that these costs be expensed currently, rather than included in overhead costs. We do not believe this standard will have a material effect on our financial results when
adopted. SFAS No123R Share Based Payment Revised 2004 Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No123, revised in December, 2004, SFAS 123R, will be effective for our Company beginning
January1, 2006. SFAS 123R supercedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No123R requires that all
share-based payments to employees be recorded based on fair value on the date of grant, and expensed over the expected service period. While we currently use the Black Scholes method to calculate pro forma compensation expense, this standard will
also allow a binomial method and we are currently evaluating the alternatives. The Company has chosen the modified prospective method of adoption. SFAS No123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow. Currently we generally do not record compensation
expense for employee stock options and present pro forma share-based compensation expense related to our stock options in the notes to our financial statements. Although the Company is currently evaluating the impact of applying the various
provisions of SFAS 123R, the Company expects the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. We do not expect material effects on our consolidated financial position or cash flows.

SFAS No154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No20
and FASB Statement No3 Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No154 Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections - a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement No3 SFAS 154 will be effective for our Company January1, 2006. This Statement changes the accounting and reporting of voluntary changes in accounting
principles, or the adoption of new principles that do not specify transition rules. Generally, SFAS 154 requires changes in accounting principles be reported by applying the principles to previously issued financial statements as if the principles
had always been used. SFAS 154 also requires changes in depreciation, amortization or depletion methods be accounted for in the period the change occurs and in future periods if the change affects both. SFAS 154 carries forward the previously
existing guidance of APB Opinion No20 for reporting changes in accounting estimates and correction of an error in a previously issued financial statement. This Statement is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
financial statements. 3. Investments The Company has investments in marketable securities, all of which were classified as available for sale at December 31, 2005 as follows in thousands:  Balances as of December31, 2005

The Companys investments include U.S., State and municipal government obligations and domestic
public corporate debt securities. Investments are classified as short-term or long-term based on the availability of these securities to meet current operating requirements. All of these investments are held in the name of the Company at a limited
number of financial institutions. As of December31, 2005 and 2004, all of the Companys investments were marketable securities
classified as short term, available for sale securities, and are reported at their fair values based upon quoted market prices as of the reporting date. If these investments are sold at a loss or experience a decline in value that is not temporary,
the loss is recognized in the statement of operations for that period. Unrealized gains or losses that are considered temporary in nature are recorded as a separate component of cumulative other comprehensive income loss in stockholders
equity, net of the related tax effect. Subsequent recoveries in the fair value, if any, are not recognized in the statement of operations, but as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The specific identification method is
used to determine the cost of securities disposed of, with realized gains and losses recorded in interest income, net. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not incur significant realized gains or losses on disposals of marketable securities.
The unrealized loss balances on US Government and Corporate debt securities resulted primarily from interest rate increases. Because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery of fair value, which may be at
maturity, the Company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at December31, 2005. The
Companys investment policy limits the concentration of its investments in any single instrument to a maximum of $1 million or 10%, whichever is less, other than U.S. Government or Agencies securities, which do not have limitations. All of the
Companys securities must be readily marketable and have high quality debt ratings from either Moodys or Standard Poors. Investments may not have maturities in excess of three years, and the average portfolio maturity is
maintained at one year or less. The Company is in compliance with its investment policy at December31, 2005. 4. Business Combinations
On November25, 2003 the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares, stock options and warrants of Paragon Networks
International, Inc Paragon for total consideration of $20596 million. We accounted for the transaction using the purchase method of accounting. The results of Paragons operations have been included in our consolidated financial
statements since November25, 2003. The aggregate purchase price of $20596 million, included $411,000 in cash and 1,334,521 shares
of Carrier Access common stock, valued using the average closing price as of November25, 2003, including the two days before and after that date, and other direct acquisition costs as follows in thousands:  Cash 411
Carrier Access stock issued to seller 19,163
Estimated acquisition related costs 1,022 Total Consideration 20,596 In addition, the Company paid approximately $10 million to the employees of Paragon. Of this,
approximately $670,000 was capitalized as part of the acquisition cost, as it required no future performance, while approximately $330,000 related to retention bonuses, which were expensed in 2003 as the service obligations were completed. The
Company also incurred approximately $350,000 of direct acquisition costs that were paid in 2004. The following table summarizes the
Companys initial estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The price paid was greater than the net assets and liabilities due to the expected increase in future revenues and cash flows
arising from the Paragon products and customer base.  As of November25,2003 Current assets 7,296 Property and equipment 572 Other assets 42 Intangible assets 7,800 Goodwill 6,748 Total assets acquired 22,458 Current liabilities 1,862 Net assets acquired 20,596 
46 Table of Contents
In connection with the acquisition, the Company acquired approximately $69 million of net deferred tax
assets, comprised of deferred tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities related to the intangible assets acquired, which have been fully reduced by a valuation allowance. 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company finalized its purchase price accounting related to the Paragon acquisition, and the Company recorded an
$840,000 liability with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill related to a preacquisition tax contingency. As discussed in Note 12, future adjustments to this contingent liability, if any, will be recorded in our consolidated statement of
operations in the period that an adjustment is considered necessary. Of the $78 million of acquired intangible assets, $51 million was
assigned to customer relationships, $25 million to developed product technology and $02 million to customer backlog. All of these intangible assets were determined to have definite lives and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which
are customer relationships 7 years, developed product technology 5 years and the customer backlog 3 months. The estimated fair values for
the acquired customer relationships, developed product technology and customer backlog intangibles were determined primarily based on the discounted value of projected cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital used to discount projected cash
flows associated with customer relationships, developed product technology and the customer backlog was within a Range of 20% to 27%. The projected cash flows were derived using managements best estimates of future revenues and profit margins
associated with each intangible, reduced by estimated returns on contributory assets required to generate the cash flows from these assets, and adjusted for anticipated tax effects associated with amortization of these assets. The fair value of
goodwill was determined using the residual method. The following unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared to give
effect to the acquisition of Paragon Networks International, Inc. These pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial statements were prepared as if the acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2002 and as of January 1, 2003 for
purposes of the statement of operations.

contingency that existed at the time of the acquisition, in accordance with SFAS No. 38, Preacquisition Contingencies. The contingency was related to potential tax liabilities in a foreign jurisdiction. See note 12 for further discussion.
Because the information was not available as of the November 2003 purchase date or at the time the Company filed its 2003 annual report on Form 10-K, an amount could not be estimated that could be used for purposes of the Companys initial
purchase price allocation. In December 2003, the Company began the effort to evaluate and estimate the fair value of the contingency, including gathering all relevant information regarding the applicable tax rates and regulations in the foreign
jurisdictions. The Companys determination was completed in November 2004. In accordance with that final determination, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company recorded an $840,000 liability with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. As
discussed in note 12, future adjustments to the contingent liability will be recorded in the statement of operations in the period of the adjustment. 5. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed using standard costs that
approximate average purchase costs. Consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. Inventories as of December31 consist of the following in thousands: 2005 2004 Raw materials 27,713 31,276 Work-in-process 1 16 Finished goods 4,567 7,269 Reserve for obsolescence 7,775 6,552 24,506 32,009 6. Property and Equipment, Net On October13, 2004, the Company purchased the building and land of its 5395 Pearl Parkway headquarters in Boulder, Colorado for approximately $71
million. The value of the building is classified as real property. Leasehold improvements related to the property were reclassified to real property and are being depreciated over the lesser of their useful life or the life of the
building. An amount of $604,000 related to deferred rent that was recorded during the periods when the building was leased was recorded as a reduction to the cost of the building. Property and equipment, net as of December31 consisted of the followingin thousands:  Estimated useful life

was determined using the residual method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard Nos. 141 and 142. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we finalized our purchase price accounting and recorded an additional $84 million of goodwill related to a
preacquisition tax contingency. In the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as
required by FAS 142. Our assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by estimating and comparing the fair value of our reporting unit, as defined in FAS 142, to the reporting unit carrying value as of that date. Based on the results of this
impairment test, the Company determined that its goodwill asset was not impaired during 2005, 2004 or 2003. The Company plans to conduct annual impairment tests in the third quarter of each year, unless impairment indicators exist at an earlier date
each year. 8. Income Taxes Income tax expense benefit for the years ended December31 in thousands consists of the following:  U.S. Taxes

tax credit carry forwards of approximately $495 million and $51 million, respectively. The net operating loss carry forwards began to expire in 2005. The tax credit carry forwards begin to expire in 2012. A portion of the future utilization of the
Companys net operating loss carry forwards associated with the Paragon acquisition in 2003, amounting to approximately $79 million, is limited because the acquisition resulted in an ownership change. In 2003, a portion of prior year net
operating losses were carried back and the Company received a refund of income taxes of approximately $70 million. 
49 Table of Contents
The Company has approximately $410 million of available net operating loss carry forwards for state tax
purposes, which may be carried forward to offset future state taxable income, subject to state legislative restrictions which vary among the States. The Company recorded valuation allowances of $289 million and $262 million as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to fully reserve deferred tax assets as the realization criteria have not been met. In
the future, should management conclude that these deferred tax assets are, at least in part, realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced to the extent of such realization and recognized as a deferred income tax benefit in the statement of
operations, except as noted herein. The valuation allowance at December31, 2005 includes a reserve established at the time of the Paragon acquisition related to net deferred tax assets acquired of approximately $69 million. Should the Company
conclude the valuation allowance with respect to these acquired net deferred tax assets is no longer necessary, the amount will be recorded as a decrease in the carrying amount of acquired goodwill. Also included in the valuation allowance is a $44
million reserve for the federal tax benefit resulting from certain exercises of employee non-qualified stock options. To the extent, the valuation allowance related to these stock based compensation benefits is no longer considered necessary, an
adjustment will be recorded directly to additional paid in capital. 9. Stock Options Pursuant to the Companys 1998 stock option plan the Plan, a committee appointed by the Companys Board of Directors may grant
incentive and nonqualified options to employees, consultants and directors. The Plan currently authorizes the grant of options to purchase up to 9,217,014 shares of authorized common stock. On January1, of each year, an additional 562,500
shares are made available for grant under the plan. Incentive stock options have a ten-year term and non-qualified stock options have a five-year term. A majority of the stock options vest 25% on the first anniversary date of the grant and 625%
each quarter thereafter, with the remaining stock options vesting 100% four years from the grant date. The following summarizes stock option activity under the Plan:  Outstanding Options Number ofShares Weighted Average ExercisePrice

1,536,165 686 As of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, 1,536,165, 918,045 and 1,197,602 outstanding options
were exercisable at an aggregate average exercise price per share of $686, $559 and $618, respectively. Shares available for grant under the Plan as of December31, 2005 were 2,442,916. On December27, 2005, the companys Board of Directors approved acceleration of vesting for all unvested stock options, excluding options held
by executive officers and directors, with an exercise price greater than $705. As a result, options previously awarded to current employees for the purchase of 359,335 shares of the Companys common stock vested immediately. The accelerated
options have exercise prices ranging from $706 to $1540. The weighted average exercise price of these options is $1073. On
August26, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a modification to the expiration date of certain vested options held by certain former employees under the 1988 Stock Incentive Plan due to an extended blackout period.
Under the terms of the modifications, former employees were granted an additional three-month period in which to exercise vested options adjusted by the number of days prior to May5, 2005, if any, that the employee could have exercised the
options. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock-Based Compensation, and interpretation of APB Opinion No25, the
Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $77,000 for the year ended December31, 2005 in connection with this modification. In 2003, the Company issued options to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock to consultants for services during the year. These options had an exercise price of $077 per share and were immediately exercisable. The fair market value of
these options was determined to be $24,000 and was recognized in general and administrative expense. The fair value was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 30 contractual lives of five years; no dividend yield; and 111% volatility. These options were exercised on April11, 2003. The Company
issued options to purchase 62,500 shares of common stock to consultants for services during the year ended December31, 2001. These options have exercise prices from $280 to $650 per share, are exercisable at the date of grant and expire at
various dates from January2, 2006 to October16, 2006. 10. Significant Customers, Suppliers and Concentration of Credit Risk

International net revenues, or net revenues on products shipped outside of the United States accounted
for approximately 4%, 9% and 11% of our total net revenues in for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Although the Company generally uses
standard parts and components for its products, many key components are purchased from sole or single source vendors for which alternative sources may not currently be available. The identification and utilization of new suppliers for such items
could adversely impact the Companys future operating results. The Company is exposed to potential concentrations of credit risk from
its accounts receivable with its various customers and receivables are concentrated among customers in the telecommunications industry. To reduce this risk, the Company has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of its customers and monitors the
aging of its accounts receivable for potential uncollectible accounts. An allowance is recorded for estimated losses from write-offs of uncollectible accounts. Bad debt recoveries were $289,000 in 2004 and $31 million in 2003. In 2002, a number of
our customers filed for bankruptcy and one of our distributors was experiencing financial difficulties which caused a significant amount of accounts receivables to become delinquent. In 2003, we were able to recover most of the delinquent
receivables and part of the accounts receivable related to the bankruptcies. 11. Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a defined contribution employee benefit plan the 401k Plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code that is
available to all employees who meet the 401k Plans eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute up to the maximum limits allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. The 401k Plan provides for matching 50% of an employees pre-tax
contributions, up to 6% of each participating employees annual salary. The Company suspended matching contributions effective January1, 2003 and did not make any employer matching or other contributions to the 401k Plan during the
years ended December31, 2005, 2004, or 2003. Beginning January1, 2006, the Company has reinstated the employer matching contribution as described above. 12. Commitments and Contingencies Guarantees We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties
arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No5, Accounting for Contingencies FAS 5, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation
45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the
ability to make a reasonable estimate of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations, and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements.
Officer and Director Indemnification As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, the Company has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the
officer or director is, or was serving, at the Companys request in such capacity. These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the officer or director acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonable believed to be in or not
opposed to the bests interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required
to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates the Companys exposure and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a
result of the Companys insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal. Other Indemnifications As is customary in the Companys industry, as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other
jurisdictions, the Companys standard contracts provide remedies to its customers, such as defense, settlement or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, the Company provides
standard indemnification to our customers against combinations of loss, expense or liability arising from various trigger events related to the sale and use of our products and services.

Litigation On August16, 2002, SMTC Manufacturing Corporation of Colorado SMTC filed a breach of contract claim and related claims against the Company in District Court, County of Adams, Colorado. The claim was based on an
inventory-purchasing dispute and SMTC sought damages of $134 million. On October17, 2002, the Company filed a breach of contract counterclaim and other related counterclaims in District Court, County of Adams, Colorado for $10 million. On
December5, 2002, the Company amended its counterclaim to seek damages of $270 million. The Company settled the SMTC lawsuit in September 2004 and as a result recorded a charge for the quarter ending September30, 2004, in the amount of
$21 million to reflect the settlement amount and legal expenses associated with the settlement. In November of 2003, the Company acquired
Paragon. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed liabilities for value-added taxes and employee payroll taxes that may be payable to certain foreign taxing authorities. The estimated fair value of value-added taxes, employee payroll
taxes and associated interest and penalties assumed was estimated to be approximately $840,000. Estimated employee payroll taxes, value-added taxes, and interest and penalties on unremitted balances incurred after the acquisition dates have been
accrued and expensed. The total amount of the contingent liability as of December31, 2005 including taxes was approximately $15 million. It is reasonably possible that the Companys estimates will differ from the amounts ultimately paid
to settle this liability. Adjustments to the Companys estimates or to what is ultimately paid to taxing authorities in future periods will be included in earnings of the period in which the adjustment is determined. Beginning on June2, 2005, three purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Colorado against Carrier Access Corporation and certain of our officers and directors. The cases, captioned Croker v. Carrier Access Corporation, et al., Case No05-cv-1011-LTB; Chisman v. Carrier Access Corporation, et al., Case
No05-cv-1078-REB, and Sved v. Carrier Access Corporation, et al., Case No05-cv-1280-EWN, have been consolidated and are purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased our publicly traded securities between October21,
2003 and May20, 2005. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements, purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws, and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. The complaints
are based upon allegations of wrongdoing in connection with our announcement of our intention to restate previously issued financial statements for the year ended December31, 2004 and certain interim periods in each of the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003. Beginning on June13, 2005, three purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United
States District Court for the District of Colorado, against various of our officers and directors and naming Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. The cases are captioned Kenney v. Koenig, et al., Case No05-cv-1074-PSF, Chaitman v.
Koenig, et al., Case No05-cv-1095-LTB and West Coast Management and Capital, LLC v. Koenig {sic}, et al. Case No05-cv-1134-RPM. These actions were consolidated in August 2005. The complaints include claims for breach of
fiduciary duty, abuse of control, waste of corporate assets, mismanagement and unjust enrichment; seek compensatory damages, disgorgement, and other relief; and are based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions described in the
preceding paragraph. On October12, 2005, we moved to dismiss for failure to plead demand futility, and the individual defendants moved to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and all of the other
counts. On September12, 2005, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was file in Boulder County, Colorado District Court against
various of our officers and directors naming Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. This case is captioned Dietz v. Koenig, et. al. On September28, 2005 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the 20th District in the State of Colorado, Boulder County District Court, against various of our officers and directors and naming
Carrier Access as a nominal defendant. This case is captioned Novak v. Koenig et. al. On October24, 2005, the Company removed the Novak action to federal court and the parties have stayed the Dietz matter pending the above filed motions. The
Dietz and Novak complaints include claims for breach of fiduciary duty, violation of by-laws and other relief, and are based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions described in the preceding paragraphs. Management believes that the claims in the class action and related suits are without merit. Because these lawsuits are at a very preliminary stage,
management cannot at this time determine the probability or reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. Were an unfavorable outcome to occur, it could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position and results of operations
for the period in which such outcome occurred. Legal fees associated with commitments or contingencies are expensed as incurred.

Leases The Company leases certain office, manufacturing and warehouse space under various noncancellable-operating leases that expire through 2008. As of December31, 2005, the following future minimum lease payments are due under our current
lease obligations. In addition to these minimum lease payments, the Company is contractually obligated under certain of its lease agreements to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the leases, such as maintenance, taxes and insurance.

Thereafter Total 1,145 The Company records rent expense under noncancellable operating leases, including the effect of
any future rent escalations or rent holiday periods, on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Any difference between actual payments and recorded rent expense is report within accrued liabilities. Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 totaled $06 million, $17 million, and $16 million respectively. Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has
placed noncancellable purchase orders for approximately $731 million of inventory from certain of its vendors for delivery in 2006. These orders are generally placed up to 4 months in advance based on the lead-time of the inventory. 13. Quarterly Financial Information unaudited The

18 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15e and Rule 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 1 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and 2 is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our
disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable
assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of our assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could
have a material effect on our financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Hein Associates LLP, has issued an attestation report on our assessment of
internal control over financial reporting. Its report appears on page 58 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Disclosure and Reporting
Except as described below, no changes in the our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
December31, 2005 that has materially effected, or is reasonably likely to materially effect, our internal control over financial reporting. Remediation of Internal Control Weaknesses Previously Reported In the course of the preparation and audit of our
financial statements for the fiscal year ended December31, 2004, we determined that we had not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting due to the material weaknesses in the following areas: 1 the preparation of our
consolidated statement of cash flows, 2 evaluation of customer arrangements for appropriate recognition of revenue for its products, 3 accounting for inventory reserves, and 4 a lack of personnel with sufficient technical accounting expertise to
identify and account for complex transactions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We amended
our Annual Reports on Form 10-K Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004 to amend and restate our consolidated financial statements and related financial information for the fiscal years ended December31, 2004 and 2003.
The Form 10-K/A also included restated quarterly information for each of the quarters within the fiscal years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. In addition, we implemented, during the year ended December31, 2005, improvements to our
internal control over financial reporting to address each of these material weaknesses and prevent a recurrence of such issues, as follows:  Lack of Personnel with Sufficient Technical Accounting Expertise: In late 2004, we augmented our technical accounting staff by adding a Director of Financial Reporting
position and hiring an experienced Certified Public Accountant for this position. Additionally, during 2005, we hired a new Controller and Chief Financial Officer, both of whom are Certified Public Accountants. Our new Controller has public
accounting and public company reporting experience. Our Chief Financial Officer has in-depth experience with the specific accounting and reporting issues applicable to our business and industry from his previous experience as Chief Financial Officer
with another company with similar business, accounting and reporting issues.  Preparation of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: The Controller prepares our consolidated statements of cash flows. The Director of Financial Reporting and the
Controller perform a joint detailed review of our consolidated statements of cash flows. All significant questions arising from the independent review are resolved prior to finalizing the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Evaluation of Customer Arrangements for Appropriate Recognition of Revenue: We have implemented internal review procedures to ensure that all significant new, and
modifications of existing, customer arrangements are identified and communicated, subject to a joint review by technically competent accounting and legal personnel, and to ensure that all applicable revenue recognition considerations are identified,
documented and implemented when recording and reporting revenue transactions. Further, we have implemented additional controls over period end revenue cutoff to ensure that revenues are reported in the appropriate accounting period. In addition, our
Chief Financial Officer, who is a Certified Public Accountant, actively monitors compliance with and execution of these processes. 
56 Table of Contents Accounting for Inventory Reserves: We have implemented a new procedure that requires our Controller to perform a detailed review of the inventory reserve calculation to
ensure inventory values previously written down to lower of cost or market in earlier periods are not restored. The inventory reserve adjustment is also reviewed by our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Company has implemented a bi-weekly technical accounting review session, led by our Director of Financial Reporting and attended by key
accounting personnel, including our Controller and Chief Financial Officer. In these sessions, new accounting guidance and pronouncements that impact the Company are discussed, as well as the accounting treatment for new transactions, products or
services, new disclosure requirements and other current accounting and reporting issues. Furthermore, key accounting staff members attend external accounting or financial reporting seminars as part of an ongoing skills development plan.
