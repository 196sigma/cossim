Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Exelixis, Inc.  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
included in Item 9A, that Exelixis, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Exelixis, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Exelixis, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  In our
opinion, managements assessment that Exelixis, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Exelixis,
Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of Exelixis, Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of Exelixis, Inc. and our report
dated March 2, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  /s/ Ernst Young LLP  Palo Alto, California March 2, 2005

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Organization  Exelixis, Inc.
Exelixis, we, our, or us is a biotechnology company whose primary mission is to leverage its biological expertise and integrated drug discovery capabilities to develop high-quality, differentiated
pharmaceutical products in the treatment of cancer, metabolism and other serious diseases. We use comparative genomics and model system genetics to find new drug targets and compounds that we believe would be difficult or impossible to uncover using
other experimental approaches. Our research is designed to identify novel genes and proteins expressed by those genes that, when changed, either decrease or increase the activity in a specific disease pathway in a therapeutically relevant manner.
These genes and proteins represent either potential product targets or drugs that may treat disease or prevent disease initiation or progression. Our most advanced pharmaceutical programs focus on drug discovery and development of small molecules in
cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and other serious diseases. We believe that our proprietary technologies are valuable to other industries whose products can be enhanced by an understanding of DNA or proteins, including the
agrochemical, agricultural and diagnostic industries.  Basis of
Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements
include accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  We record our minority ownership interests in Genoptera LLC using the equity method of accounting.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.  Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Restricted Cash and Investments  We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. We invest our excess cash in high-grade, short-term commercial paper and money market funds, which invest in U.S. Treasury securities that are subject to minimal credit and market risk.  All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair value. We view our available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in current operations. Accordingly, we have classified all investments as short-term, even though the stated maturity date may be one year or more beyond the
current balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices of the securities. Unrealized gains and losses on such securities, when material, are reported as a separate component of
stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses, net, on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified
as available-for-sale are included in interest income.

2004, unrealized losses were primarily due to increases in interest rates. The gross unrealized losses in our portfolio of investments represents less than one percent of the total fair value of the portfolio. We have concluded that unrealized
losses in our investment securities are not other-than-temporary and we have the intent and ability to hold impaired securities to maturity or call date. Realized gains amounted to none in 2004, none in 2003 and $65,000 in 2002.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful
lives, generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease. Equipment held under capital lease is stated at the lower of the cost of the related
asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Intangible Assets  Intangible assets have been amortized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:  Developed technology
3-5years
Patents/core technology
15 years
Assembled workforce
2 years
Long-lived Assets 
We account for our long-lived assets under SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144 adopted on January 1, 2002. SFAS 144 retains the requirements of SFAS 121 
59 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
to recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents and short-term investments, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. We have estimated the fair value of our long term-debt instruments using the net present value of the payments discounted at an interest rate that
is consistent with our current borrowing rate for similar long-term debt. Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans and capital lease obligations with similar terms, the carrying value of our debt obligations approximates fair
value, with the exception of our $850 million convertible loan with GlaxoSmithKline. We estimated the fair value of our convertible loan with GlaxoSmithKline at December 31, 2004 to be approximately $733 million.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit
risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and investments in marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of money market funds, taxable commercial paper, corporate bonds with high credit quality,
U.S. government agency obligations and auction rate securities. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are maintained with financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured
and are concentrated in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Accordingly, we may be exposed to credit risk generally associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We have incurred no bad debt expense since inception.
The following table sets forth revenue recognized under our
collaboration agreements that exceed 10% or more of total revenue during the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:  Collaborator

19 21 25  Revenue Recognition 
License, research commitment and other non-refundable payments received in
connection with research collaboration agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements, generally the research term. Contract research revenues are recognized as services are
performed pursuant to the terms of the agreements. Any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue. Payments are not refundable if research is not successful.  We enter into corporate collaborations under which we may obtain up-front
license fees, research funding, and contingent milestone payments and royalties. We evaluate whether the delivered element under these arrangements has value to our customer on a stand-alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of fair
value of the undelivered item exists. Deliverables that do not meet these criteria are not evaluated separately for the purpose of revenue recognition. 
60 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Milestone payments are non-refundable and recognized as revenue over the period of the research
arrangement. This typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized at the date the milestone is achieved, which portion is equal to the applicable percentage of the research term that has elapsed at the date the milestone is
achieved, and the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement.  Revenues from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the delivery of accepted compounds.  Research and Development Expenses  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include costs associated with research performed pursuant to collaborative agreements.
Research and development costs consist of direct and indirect internal costs related to specific projects as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct certain research activities on our behalf.  Substantial portions of our pre-clinical studies and all of our clinical
trials have been performed by third-party contract research organizations CROs and other vendors. We accrue costs for pre-clinical studies performed by our vendors on a straight-line basis over the term of the service period and adjust our
estimates as required. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study. For clinical trial expenses, the significant factors used in
estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled and for how long they have been in enrolled in the study. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, correspondence with
contract research organizations and review of contractual terms.  Net Loss
Per Share  Basic and diluted net loss per share are
computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted for shares that are subject to repurchase. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes
potential common stock because their effect is antidilutive. Potential common stock consists of common stock subject to repurchase, incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and shares issuable upon
conversion of the convertible promissory note.  The following
table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would be antidilutive for the year ended December 31, 2004:  Options to purchase common stock

Exelixis subsidiaries located in Germany operate
using local currency as the functional currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange
rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
61 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Stock-Based Compensation  We have employee and director stock option plans that are more fully described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. We recognize employee stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25
and related interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements for the stock options granted to employees, which had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of
grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net loss and loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS

Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income loss represents net income loss plus the results of certain stockholders equity changes,
which are comprised of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and cumulative translation adjustments, not reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.  Comprehensive income loss for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and

period presentation.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial
statement recognition. We will be required to adopt SFAS 123R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, beginning July 1, 2005. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the
amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be 
63 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive option, prior periods may be
restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter
of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. We are evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and expect that
the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. We have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and we have not determined whether the
adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123.  NOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS  X-Ceptor
Therapeutics  In October 2004, we completed the acquisition
of X-Ceptor Therapeutics, Inc. X-Ceptor. X-Ceptor, a privately held company located in San Diego, California, which was focused on the discovery and development of small molecules that modulate nuclear hormone receptors NHRs. NHRs
represent a promising class of clinically and commercially validated gene targets that are implicated in a wide range of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. 
The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of assets. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $257 million, which
consisted of approximately 26 million shares of our common stock, $29 million in cash, and $23 million in transaction costs. The transaction costs include financial advisory, legal, accounting and other fees. At December 31, 2004, approximately
$03 million and 21% of the 26 million shares of common stock were held in an escrow account.  The purchase price allocation is as follows in thousands:  Tangible assets acquired 2,591 In-process research and development 25,982 Assembled workforce 1,100 Liabilities assumed 3,933 25,740  We allocated the
purchase price to X-Ceptors tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets such as assembled workforce and acquired in-process research and development. Independent valuation experts assisted us during the valuation of the intangible
assets acquired. The $26 million of tangible assets acquired are comprised of $12 million of property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, $10 million of prepaid expenses and other assets and $04 million in cash and cash equivalents.
The $39 million in liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition are comprised of $11 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, $18 million in bank obligations, and $10 million in deferred revenue.  The acquired assembled workforce includes the estimated cost to replace
existing employees, including recruiting and training costs. We are amortizing the value assigned to the assembled workforce of approximately $11 million on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of two years. 
64 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The valuation of the acquired in-process research and development of $260 million was determined
using the income approach for each of the three projects in process. The in-process projects relate to the development of programs that are focused on the Liver X Receptor LXR valued at $97 million, Farnesoid X Receptor FXR valued at $88
million and Mineralocorticoid Receptor MR valued at $75 million, which are expected to be completed over approximately the next seven to ten years. At the time of the acquisition, these programs did not have a development candidate. 
The income approach estimates the value of each acquired project in
process based on its expected future cash flows. The valuation analysis considered the percent complete of each in-process research and development project. The expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in-process research and
development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of 15% which is considered commensurate with the inherent risk and percentage of completion of the in-process projects. The purchased technology was not considered to have
reached technological feasibility and since it has no alternative future use do to the early stage of the programs, the considerable complexity and uniqueness of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining, it was recorded as
a component to operating expense.  The revenues, expenses, cash
flows and other assumptions underlying the estimated fair value of the acquired in-process research and development involve significant risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties associated with completing the acquired in-process projects
include obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and being able to successfully and profitably produce, distribute and sell products.  Agrinomics  In July 1999, Exelixis Plant Sciences formerly Agritope, Inc. and Bayer CropScience formerly Aventis CropScience USA LP formed Agrinomics LLC to
conduct a research, development and commercialization program in the field of agricultural functional genomics. As a result of our acquisition of Exelixis Plant Sciences in 2000, we owned a 50% interest in Agrinomics, while Bayer CropScience owned
the remaining 50% interest. In May 2004, we purchased from Bayer CropScience its 50% interest in Agrinomics in exchange for our release of all future obligations of Bayer CropScience to Agrinomics under the joint venture agreement and we granted
license rights to the research, development and commercialization program in the field of agricultural functional genomics held by Agrinomics. The primary reason for the transfer was to allow both Bayer CropScience and us to develop the technology
of the joint venture independently. As there is no readily determinable fair market value for Bayer CropSciences 50% interest in Agrinomics or Bayer CropSciences future obligations, if any, under the Agrinomics joint venture agreement,
we recorded this acquisition of a business as a non-monetary transaction. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the purchase price was deemed to be zero.  We recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, as determined by us based on
valuation techniques in accordance with GAAP. As a result of this transaction, we recorded net tangible liabilities of $05 million, intangible assets of $01 million and expense associated with the purchase of in-process research and development of
$04 million, representing the fair value of two primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and that have no alternative future use. This transaction did not have a material impact on our financial condition or
results of operations.  Pro Forma Results  Under the purchase method of accounting our historical statements of
operations include the results of Agrinomics only subsequent to the acquisition dates of May 2004. The following unaudited pro forma financial 
65 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
information for the year ended December 31, 2004 presents our consolidated results as if the acquisition of Agrinomics had occurred at the beginning of 2004
and 2003. All non-recurring charges relating to the acquisition, such as acquired in-process research and development charge are not reflected in the following pro forma financial information. The unaudited pro forma information for the year ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 is not intended to be indicative of future operations results in thousands, except per share data:  2004 2003 Total revenues 52,882 50,204 Net loss 137,364 98,485 Net loss per share, basic and diluted 189 151
Genomica Corporation
On December 28, 2001, Exelixis acquired 94% of the total
number of outstanding shares of common stock of Genomica Corporation Genomica. On January 8, 2002, the merger of Genomica was completed. Upon effectiveness of the merger, Genomica became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exelixis. Prior to
the acquisition, we adopted an exit plan for Genomica. Under this exit plan, we terminated Genomicas entire workforce and abandoned its leased facilities in Boulder, Colorado and Sacramento, California. The estimated costs of the exit plan
amounted to $29 million, consisted primarily of employee severance and benefits and lease abandonment costs and were included as part of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining actions to be taken under
the exit plan consisted primarily of residual payments of approximately $03 million related to the lease obligation for the facility in Boulder, Colorado.  In April 2002, Exelixis transferred the Genomica software business to Visualize, Inc. Visualize for future consideration of up to $24
million in license fees and royalty payments. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Visualize obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently licensing the Genomica software, including the sole right to further
develop and license the software to other third parties. Exelixis retains an internal use license for the software. Royalties that Exelixis receives, if any, will be recorded in the period they are earned as a gain from discontinued operations. In
addition, Visualize assumed the lease obligation for Genomicas abandoned facility in Sacramento, California. As a result of this transaction, we reported the operating results of Genomica and the estimated loss on the sale of Genomica as
discontinued operations. For the period beginning January 1, 2002 to Genomicas disposal in April 2002, Genomicas operating results consisted of revenues of approximately $01 million and an operating loss of approximately $05 million.
Our loss on the sale of Genomica includes the write-off of remaining goodwill of approximately $10 million, partially offset by a reversal of approximately $02 million as a result of the assumption of Genomicas lease obligation for the
Sacramento, California facility by Visualize.  NOTE 3 RESEARCH AND
COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS  Renessen  In December 2002, Agrinomics, our wholly-owned subsidiary, established an
alliance to enhance seed oil content in commercially valuable crops with Renessen LLC. Renessen is a joint venture between Monsanto Company and Cargill, Inc. The collaboration combines Agrinomics technological leadership in agricultural
functional genomics, high-throughput gene screening and seed trait identification, developed at Exelixis Plant Sciences, with Renessens global expertise in quality trait crop development and commercialization, with the goal of accelerating the
development of novel proprietary crops with improved seed composition traits. This 
66 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
collaboration leverages the unique capabilities of Agrinomics powerful ACTTAG gene activation and selection platform to rapidly discover and validate genes that can optimize important seed traits
in order to increase the commercial value of many of the worlds most significant agricultural crops. Agrinomics can also earn additional amounts under the agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones, as well as royalties on
commercialized products that may emerge from the collaboration. In addition, Renessen is obligated to contribute research and product development capabilities in taking gene candidates identified by Agrinomics into crop products that include leading
commercial germplasm. In February 2005, Agrinomics entered into an amendment to the original collaboration agreement with Renessen that expands and extends the original alliance between Agrinomics and Renessen.  Bayer Corporation  In May 1998, we entered into a six-year research collaboration agreement with Bayer Corporation Bayer to
identify novel screening targets for the development of new pesticides for use in crop protection. We provided research services directed towards identifying and investigating molecular targets in insects and nematodes that may be useful in
developing and commercializing pesticide products. We received a $12 million license fee upon execution of the agreement that was deferred and will be recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.  In December 1999, we significantly expanded our relationship with Bayer by
forming a joint venture in the form of a new limited liability company, Genoptera LLC Genoptera. Under the terms of the Genoptera operating agreement, Bayer provides 100% of the capital necessary to fund the operations of Genoptera and
has the ability to control the entity with a 60% ownership interest. We own the other 40% interest in Genoptera without making any capital contribution and report our investment in Genoptera using the equity method of accounting. Bayers
initial capital contributions to Genoptera were $100 million in January 2000 and another $100 million in January 2001. Bayer is required to also contribute cash to Genoptera in amounts necessary to fund its ongoing operating expenses. Genoptera
has incurred losses since inception. Since the carrying value of this investment is zero and there is no obligation to fund future losses, we have not recorded equity method losses to date for Genoptera.  In January 2000, we, Bayer and Genoptera entered into an exclusive eight-year
research collaboration agreement, which superseded the 1998 agreement discussed above. We are required to provide Genoptera with expanded research services focused on developing insecticides and nematicides for crop protection. Under the terms of
the collaboration agreement, Genoptera paid us a $100 million license fee and a $100 million research commitment fee. One-half of these fees were received in January 2000, and the remaining amounts were received in January 2001. Additionally,
Genoptera is required to pay us approximately $100 million in annual research funding. We can earn additional payments under the collaboration agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones. We can also earn royalties on the future sale by
Bayer of pesticide products incorporating compounds developed against targets and assays under the agreement. The agreement also provides Bayer an exclusive royalty-free option to use certain technology developed under the agreement in the
development of fungicides and herbicides. To the extent permitted under the collaboration agreement, if we were to develop and sell certain human health or agrochemical products that incorporate compounds developed under the agreement, it would be
obligated to pay royalties to Genoptera. No such activities are expected for the foreseeable future.  Bristol-Myers Squibb  In
September 1999, we entered into a three-year research and technology transfer agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Bristol-Myers Squibb or BMS to identify the mechanism of action MOA of 
67 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
compounds delivered to us by BMS. In July 2002, the agreement was extended for an additional two years. BMS agreed to pay us a $03 million technology access
fee, which was recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, we received research funding ranging from $13 million in the first year up to as much as $25 million annually in future years. We can also earn
additional amounts under the agreement upon the achievement of certain milestones as well as earn royalties on the future sale by BMS of human products incorporating compounds developed under the agreement. The agreement also includes technology
transfer and licensing terms, which call for BMS and us to license and share certain core technologies in genomics and lead optimization. In accordance with the terms of the two-year extension this agreement expired during July 2004.  In July 2001, we entered into a collaboration with BMS involving three
agreements: a a Stock Purchase Agreement; b a Cancer Collaboration Agreement; and c a License Agreement. Under the terms of the collaboration, BMS i purchased 600,600 shares of Exelixis common stock in a private placement at a purchase price
of $3330 per share, for cash proceeds to Exelixis of approximately $200 million; ii agreed to pay Exelixis a $50 million upfront license fee and provide Exelixis with $30 million per year in research funding for a minimum of three years; and
iii granted to Exelixis a worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to becatecarin XL119 developed by BMS, which is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial as a potential treatment for bile duct tumors. Due to risk and uncertainties with
becatecarin, and because becatecarin had not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative use, becatecarin was assigned no value for financial reporting purposes. The premium in excess of fair market value of $100 million paid for the
common stock purchased by BMS was accounted for similar to an upfront license fee and was recognized ratably over the life of the initial research term.  In December 2003, this collaboration was extended until January 2007, with the right for BMS to continue the collaboration until July 2009. The goal of
the extension is to increase the total number and degree of validation of cancer targets that we will deliver to Bristol-Myers Squibb. Each company will maintain the option to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to equal numbers of validated targets
arising from the collaboration. Under the terms of the extended collaboration, Bristol-Myers Squibb provided us with an upfront payment and will provide increased annual research funding and milestones on certain cancer targets arising from the
collaboration that progress through specified stages of validation. We will also be entitled to receive milestones on compounds in the event of successful clinical and regulatory events and royalties on commercialized products.  SmithKlineBeecham Corporation/GlaxoSmithKline  In October 2002, Exelixis and SmithKlineBeecham Corporation, which does
business as GlaxoSmithKline established a collaboration to discover and develop novel therapeutics in the areas of vascular biology, inflammatory disease and oncology. The collaboration involved three agreements: a a Product Development and
Commercialization Agreement PDA; b a Stock Purchase and Stock Issuance Agreement SPA; and c a Loan and Security Agreement LSA. Under the terms of the PDA, GlaxoSmithKline paid us $300 million in an
upfront fee and $100 million in annual research funding, and has agreed to pay a minimum of an additional $800 million in research and development funding over the first six years of the collaboration. In January 2005, we amended the terms of our
collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline, and this amendment is described further detail in Note 13.  Under the terms of the SPA, GlaxoSmithKline purchased 20 million shares of our common stock in a private placement at a purchase price of $700 per share, which represented a premium of approximately 100% to the
stock price on the effective date of the agreements. We received cash proceeds of approximately $140 million for the purchase of these shares in November 2002. Under the terms of the SPA, we had the option to sell additional common shares to
GlaxoSmithKline in the future. 
68 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Under the original LSA, GlaxoSmithKline provided a loan facility of up to $850 million for use in
our efforts under the collaboration, and we borrowed $250 million under that agreement in December 2002, an additional $300 million in December 2003, and the remaining $30 million in December 2004. All loan amounts bear interest at a rate of 40%
per annum and are secured by the intellectual property, technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration. Principal and accrued interest becomes due in installments, beginning on or about the sixth anniversary of the
collaboration, unless the collaboration is earlier terminated by GlaxoSmithKline. Repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to us under this agreement may, at our election, be in the form of our common stock at fair market value, subject to
certain conditions.  The upfront fee and the premium portion of
the equity purchase have been deferred and are being recognized as revenue over the development term. We may also receive clinical and developmental payments based on the number and timing of compounds reaching specified milestones.  Dow AgroSciences  In July 2000, we entered into a three-year research collaboration with Dow AgroSciences LLC Dow AgroSciences
to identify the MOA of certain herbicides and fungicides delivered to it under this agreement.  Under this agreement, we receive access to a collection of proprietary compounds from Dow AgroSciences that may be useful in our human therapeutic drug discovery programs.  We are required to identify and validate targets and format assays to be used
by Dow AgroSciences to develop new classes of fungicides and herbicides. Dow AgroSciences will pay us research support fees, milestone payments and royalties based on achievements in the research and commercialization of any resultant new products.
This collaboration was extended for an additional year in August 2003 and in July 2004 we successfully concluded this collaboration.  Protein Design Labs  In May, 2001, we entered into a two-year collaboration to discover and develop humanized antibodies for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cancer
with Protein Design Labs, Inc. PDL. The collaboration uses Exelixis model organism genetics technology for the identification of new cancer drug targets and PDLs antibody and clinical development expertise to create and
develop new antibody drug candidates. This collaboration was successfully completed on schedule in May 2003. Under the terms of the collaboration, PDL provided Exelixis with $40 million in annual research funding until May 2003 and purchased a
$300 million convertible note. The note bears interest at 575%, and the interest thereon is payable annually. The note is convertible at PDLs option any time after the first anniversary of the notes issuance. The note, which matures in
2006, is convertible into Exelixis common stock at a conversion price per share equal to the lower of i $28175 or ii 110% of the Fair Market Value as defined in the note of a share of Exelixis common stock at the time of conversion.
Compound Collaborations  We entered into collaboration agreements with Cytokinetics, Inc.
Cytokinetics, Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Elan, Schering-Plough Research Institute, Inc. Schering-Plough, Scios, Inc. Scios, Merck Co., Inc. Merck and with Bayer CropScience,
to jointly design custom high-throughput screening compound libraries that Exelixis would synthesize and qualify. Each company was required to pay Exelixis a per-compound 
69 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
fee and paid an upfront technology access fee that was creditable towards the future purchase of compounds. The upfront fees were initially deferred.
Revenues under these collaboration agreements were generally recognized upon delivery of the accepted compounds. Each party retains the rights to use the compounds in its own unique drug discovery programs and in its collaborative efforts with third
parties. During 2004, our collaboration agreement with Elan terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  In January 2005, we entered into amendments to our collaboration agreements with Cytokintetics, Schering-Plough, Scios and Merck to terminate the
collaboration agreements effective December 31, 2004. Each of the amendments provides that we have fully satisfied our obligations under the terms of the original agreements. No early termination penalties were incurred in connection with the early
termination of these agreements.  NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
We had outstanding loans aggregating $51,000 and $221,000
to certain officers and employees at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The notes are general recourse or collateralized by certain real property assets, bear interest at rates ranging from 46% to 49% and have maturities through 2005. The
principal plus accrued interest will be forgiven at various rates over three to four years from the employees date of employment with Exelixis. If an employee leaves Exelixis, all unpaid and unforgiven principal and interest will be due and
payable within 60 days.  We also had outstanding loans
aggregating $53,000 that we extended at December 31, 2003, and all of the loans were repaid during the year ended December 31, 2004. The loans were issued to certain of our non-officer employees to purchase stock pursuant to their employee stock
options, and these loans had an interest rate of 650%.  For
the years ended, December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, we recognized revenues of $144 million, $138 million and $136 million, respectively, under a collaboration agreement with Bayer through our joint venture with Genoptera. We also recognized
revenues of $09 million, $24 million and $38 million under the Agrinomics joint venture for the years ended, December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In May 2004, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in Agrinomics from Bayer.

NOTE 7 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  2004 Restructuring Charges  During the second quarter of 2004, we implemented a restructuring and consolidation of our research and discovery organizations designed to optimize our
ability to generate multiple new, high-quality investigational new drug applications per year and rapidly advance these new drug candidates through clinical development. We accounted for the restructuring activity in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146. The restructuring included a reduction in force of 62 employees, the majority of which were research
personnel located in South San Francisco, California. We recorded a restructuring charge of $17 million during the second quarter of 2004 comprised primarily of involuntary termination benefits. As of December 31, 2004, the remaining restructuring
liabilities are included under the caption Other Accrued Expenses on the balance sheet and are summarized in the following table in thousands:   2004

Restructuring Charges  During the third quarter of 2003, we
implemented a worldwide restructuring of our research and development organization designed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations. The restructuring included a reduction in force of 61 research personnel located in
South San Francisco, California and Tbingen, Germany, closure of our Tbingen location and relocation of certain research activities and employees from Tbingen to South San Francisco. The restructuring plan was substantially
complete as of March31, 2004.  In connection with the
third quarter 2003 restructuring plan, we recorded a cumulative charge of approximately $15 million to date in accordance with SFAS 146, of which approximately $05 million and $10 million was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. This charge primarily consists of severance payments, retention bonuses, relocation costs, lease buyout costs and legal and outplacement services fees. The restructuring charge also includes non-cash activity including an
impairment of assets of approximately $01 million and a gain on closure of our Tbingen facility of approximately $02 million related to the removal from equity of the cumulative currency translation adjustment attributable to the
Tbingen location. The balances as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 of the restructuring liabilities are included under the caption Other Accrued Expenses on the balance sheet and are summarized in the following tables in thousands:

plan was designed to facilitate our evolution into a fully integrated drug discovery company by reallocating resources to permit greater focus on building our expanding portfolio of development programs. The restructuring resulted in a reduction in
workforce of 40 employees, primarily from our U.S. research operations. Accordingly, we recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 of $07 million, consisting primarily of involuntary termination benefits. All amounts under the
restructuring were paid as of December 31, 2003.  NOTE 8 DEBT
Our debt consists of the following in thousands:
December 31 2004 2003 GlaxoSmithKline convertible promissory loan 85,000 55,000 PDL convertible promissory note 30,000 30,000 Bank equipment lines of credit 30,326 19,483 Other 321 145,326 104,804 Less: current portion 8,928 5,367 Long-term debt 136,398 99,437  In December 2003, we
entered into a credit agreement with a bank for an equipment line of credit of up to $150 million with a draw down period of one year. During the draw down period, we make interest only 
73 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
payments on outstanding balances. At the end of the draw down period, the outstanding balance converts to a 48-month term loan. The outstanding principal
balance bears interest at LIBOR plus 0625% 29% at December 31, 2004. This equipment line of credit had been fully drawn as of December 31, 2004. Of the $150 million draw down, $16 million was in the form of an irrevocable stand by letter of
credit. This letter of credit is in lieu of a security deposit for one of our South San Francisco facilities. Pursuant to the terms of the line of credit, we are required to maintain a securities account at the bank equal to at least 100% of the
outstanding principal balance. As of December 31, 2004, the collateral balance was approximately $150 million, and we recorded this amount in the balance sheet as restricted cash and investments as the securities are restricted as to withdrawal.
Under the LSA executed in connection with the GlaxoSmithKline
collaboration, GlaxoSmithKline provided a loan facility of up to $850 million for use in our efforts under the collaboration. We borrowed $250 million under that agreement in December 2002, an additional $300 million in December 2003 and the
remaining $300 million in 2004. All loan amounts bear interest at a rate of 40% per annum and are secured by the intellectual property, technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration. Principal and accrued interest
becomes due in installments, beginning on or about the sixth anniversary of the collaboration, unless the collaboration is earlier terminated by GlaxoSmithKline. Repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to us under this agreement may, at our
election, be in the form of Exelixis common stock at fair market value, subject to certain conditions.  In May 2002, we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank for an equipment line of credit of up to $160 million with a draw down period of
one year. Each draw on the line of credit has a payment term of 48 months and bears interest at the banks published prime rate 48% at December 31, 2004. We extended the draw down period on the line-of-credit for an additional year in June
2003 and increased the principal amount of the line of credit from $160 million to $190 million in September 2003. Pursuant to the terms of this line of credit, we are required to maintain a first priority security interest in the form of a
deposit or securities account at the bank equal to 100% of the outstanding obligation under the line of credit. As of December 31, 2004, the collateral balance was approximately $130 million, and we recorded this amount in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents as the securities are not restricted as to withdrawal. This equipment line of credit had been fully drawn as of December 31, 2004.  In June 2003, we entered into a stand by letter of credit with a bank for $10 million. As of December 31, 2004, the full
amount of the letter of credit was still available. As of December 31, 2004, the collateral balance was approximately $10 million, and we recorded this amount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as restricted cash and investments as the
securities are restricted as to withdrawal.  In October 2004,
we assumed a $18 million bank obligation as part of our acquisition of X-Ceptor. Pursuant to the loan agreement we are required to make monthly installments through October 2006 of principal plus accrued interest, at the banks published prime
rate plus 15% 669% at December 31, 2004.  In December 2004,
we entered into a loan modification agreement to the loan and security agreement that we entered into in May 2002. The terms associated with the original $160 million line of credit related to the May 2002 agreement were not modified. The loan
modification agreement provides for an additional equipment line of credit in the amount of up to $200 million with a draw down period of one year. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we are required to make interest only payments through
January 2006 at an annual rate of 070% on all outstanding advances. Beginning in February 2006, we are required to make 48 equal monthly installment payments of principal plus accrued interest, at an annual rate of 070%. The loan facility is
secured by a non-interest bearing certificate of deposit account with the bank, in an amount equal to at least 100% of the outstanding obligations under the line of credit. As of December 31, 2004, the collateral balance was 
74 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
approximately $48 million, and we recorded this amount in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents as the deposit account is
not restricted as to withdrawal. As of December 31, 2004 there was approximately $152 million outstanding under this line of credit.  In May 2001, we issued a $300 million convertible promissory note to PDL in connection with a collaboration agreement see Note 3. The note bears
interest at 575%, payable annually. The note, which matures in May 2006, is convertible at PDLs option any time after the first anniversary of the note. The note is convertible into Exelixis common stock at a conversion price per share equal
to the lower of i $28175 or ii 110% of the Fair Market Value as defined in the note of a share of Exelixis common stock at the time of conversion. The full amount of the note remained outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. 
Aggregate future principal payments of our total long-term debt as of
December 31, 2004 are as follows in thousands:  Year Ending December 31 2005 8,928 2006 39,349 2007 6,165 2008 32,620 2009 29,263 Thereafter 29,001 145,326 Less current portion 8,928 136,398  NOTE 9 COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS
Stock Repurchase Agreements  Under the terms of our stock option agreements for options granted before
December 9, 2004, options are exercisable when granted, and, if exercised, the related shares are subject to repurchase upon termination of employment. Repurchase rights lapse over the vesting periods, which are generally four years. Should the
employment of the holders of common stock subject to repurchase terminate prior to full vesting of the outstanding shares, we may repurchase all unvested shares at a price per share equal to the original exercise price. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, 19 and 12,243 shares, respectively, were subject to such repurchase terms. On December 9, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a new stock option agreement under our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to which the Company may
grant options that may not be exercised early. Stock option grants after December 9, 2004 under our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan will generally be made pursuant to the new option agreement and will not permit early exercise of options.

a total of 19 shares of common stock purchased under our stock option plans were subject to repurchase at a weighted average price of $900 per share. We had 109 million stock options exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $1258 at
December 31, 2003 and 99 million stock options exercisable with a weighted-average exercise price of $1463 at December 31, 2002. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $477 422 and $738per share, respectively.

Deferred Stock Compensation. During the period from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2002,
we recorded $299 million of deferred stock compensation related to stock options granted to consultants and employees in accordance with APB 25, SFAS 123 and EITF 96-18. For options granted to consultants, we determined the fair value of the
options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: a no dividends; b expected volatility of 88%; c risk-free interest rate of 416%; and d expected lives of five and ten years. No options
were granted to consultants and we did not incur material stock compensation expense related to consultants during the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. Stock compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with FIN 28, Accounting
for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, over the vesting periods of the related options, generally four years. We recognized stock compensation expense of $01 million, $09 million and $25 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Stock Purchase Plan. In January 2000, we adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. The ESPP allows for qualified employees as defined in the ESPP to purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal
to the lower of 85% of the closing price at the beginning of the offering period or 85% of the closing price at the end of each purchase period. We issued 312,552 shares, 388,119 shares and 388,770 shares of common stock during 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, pursuant to the ESPP at an average price per share of $683, $502 and $597, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value for shares purchased pursuant to the ESPP during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $246, $189 and $445,
respectively.  401k Plan  We sponsor a 401k Retirement Plan whereby eligible employees may elect to
contribute up to the lesser of 20% of their annual compensation or the statutorily prescribed annual limit allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations. The 401k Plan permits Exelixis to make matching contributions on behalf of all
participants. Beginning in 2002, we matched 50% of the first 4% of participant contributions into the 401k Plan in the form of Exelixis stock. We expensed approximately $06 million, $05 million and $05 million related to the stock match for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  NOTE 11 INCOME
TAXES  We have incurred net losses since inception and,
consequently, we have not recorded any U.S. federal or state income taxes. We recorded a tax provision related to income earned in our foreign operations of approximately $03 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. Due to a favorable
resolution of certain matters with the German tax authorities, that tax provision was reversed in 2003. We do not expect to pay income taxes on our foreign operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.  At December 31, 2004, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $4500 million, which expire in the years 2005 through 2024. We also had net operating loss carryforwards for California of approximately $1820 million, which expire in the years 2005 through 2024. We also had federal and California
research and development tax credits of approximately $130 million and $139 million, respectively, which expire at various dates beginning in the year 2010. 
Under the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions, certain substantial changes in our ownership could result in an annual limitation on the
amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credit carryforwards before utilization.
78 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
A reconciliation of income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate to net income taxes
included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations is as follows:  December 31 2004 2003 2002 U.S. federal taxes benefit at statutory rate 46,663 32,340 28,741 Unutilized utilized net operating losses 36,916 31,394 27,690 Stock based compensation 19 310 796 Non-deductible purchased intangibles 9,198 226 226 Foreign tax expense benefit 345 345 Other 530 410 29 Total  345 345  Deferred tax assets
and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss, credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Our deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the
following in thousands:  December 31 2004 2003 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 163,670 110,650 Tax credit carryforwards 21,980 15,980 Capitalized research and development costs 9,430 10,480 Deferred revenue 12,790 23,880 Other 7,120 2,760 Total deferred tax assets 214,990 163,750 Valuation allowance 213,190 162,100 Net deferred tax assets 1,800 1,650 Deferred tax liabilities Purchased intangibles 1,800 1,650 Net deferred taxes  Realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $511
million, $400 million and $691 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Included in the valuation allowance balance at December 31, 2004 is $24 million related to the exercise of stock options, which are not reflected as an expense for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, any
future obligation in the valuation allowance relating to this amount will be credited directly to equity and not reflected as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations. In addition, approximately, $344 million of the valuation allowance
was attributable to acquisition-related items that if and when realized in future periods, will first reduce the carrying value of goodwill, then other long-lived intangible assets of the Companys acquired subsidiaries and then income tax
expense.

31, 2004, we were in compliance with these covenants. We had approximately $21 million and $61 million in equipment net of accumulated amortization under capital leases at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Licensing Agreements  We have entered into several licensing agreements with various universities and institutions under which we obtained
exclusive rights to certain patent, patent applications and other technology. Aggregate future payments pursuant to these agreements are as follows in thousands:  Year Ending December 31 2005 1,423

80 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events as defined by the related agreements. No such royalties or milestones have been paid through
December 31, 2004.  Minimum Purchase Obligation  In August 2003, we entered into a kinase pipeline access agreement with a
third party that we extended and increased during 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, we have a minimum purchase commitment totaling $20 million through December 31, 2006.  Indemnification Agreements  We have certain collaboration licensing agreements, which contain standard indemnification clauses. Such clauses typically indemnify the customer or
vendor for an adverse judgment in a lawsuit in the event of our misuse or negligence. We consider the likelihood of an adverse judgment related to an indemnification agreement to be remote. Furthermore, in the event of an adverse judgment, any
losses under such an adverse judgment may be substantially offset by corporate insurance.  NOTE 13 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  In January 2005, we amended the terms of our collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. Under the original PDA, in October 2004, an option period commenced during which GlaxoSmithKline was required to elect a pre-defined limited or expanded
program. The terms of the amended PDA reflect GlaxoSmithKlines decision to select a modified program election that is neither the limited or expanded option envisioned in the original agreement. If GlaxoSmithKline had elected the limited
program, then GlaxoSmithKline would have been able to select up to 12 targets, along with the respective compounds directed against those targets, which would have narrowed the focus of further work under the collaboration. If GlaxoSmithKline had
elected the expanded program, there would not be a narrowing of focus, and all of the collaboration targets, and their respective compounds, would have remained in the collaboration. Under the amended PDA, GlaxoSmithKline selected a modified program
election through which the focus of the collaboration is shifted to 12 internal programs at various stages of development XL784, XL647, XL999, XL880, XL184, XL820, XL844 and five earlier stage oncology programs. Each program centers on compounds
that are directed against one or more targets identified in the collaboration. Additionally, GlaxoSmithKline retains exclusivity rights to the approximately 32 specified targets that are encompassed by the 12 programs. However, we retain rights to
all compounds not encompassed by the 12 programs selected by GlaxoSmithKline and may work on any targets with the exception of the approximately 32 targets subject to the exclusivity.  Under the amended PDA, GlaxoSmithKline will be required to pay a new $300 million milestone to us upon ithe filing
of INDs for three out of four compounds XL880, XL184, XL820 and XL844 prior to the end of 2005 or iithe successful completion in 2005 of a Phase1 clinical trial for one of these four compounds. This payment, if made, will reduce by
an equal amount any milestones that would have originally been paid later in the collaboration. In return for the new $300million milestone, GlaxoSmithKline will receive a specified reduction against the first acceptance milestone as well as
a temporary reduction in the royalty rate it owes us on net sales of products developed under the collaboration. The $300 million milestone payment, if paid to us, and the related specified reduction will reduce the first acceptance milestone owed
to us and, if the acceptance milestone is less than the $300 million and the specified reduction, then the remaining balance will reduce any future product commercialization milestones that GlaxoSmithKline owes to us. GlaxoSmithKline also will be
obligated to pay an additional new $50 million milestone to us upon achieving specified progress by the end of 
81 Table of Contents EXELIXIS, INC  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2005 with respect to certain other candidates. Under the original PDA, GlaxoSmithKline would have paid the first milestone upon its selection of a compound
that had completed proof-of-concept for further development. Under the amended PDA, GlaxoSmithKline is obligated to provide research funding of $475 million over the remaining three-year term of the collaboration.  As a result of its modified program election, in January 2005 GlaxoSmithKline
purchased an additional 10 million shares of Exelixis common stock at a premium pursuant to the terms of the original SPA at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111 million. We have no further option to sell, and GlaxoSmithKline has no
further obligation to purchase, additional shares of our common stock.  NOTE
