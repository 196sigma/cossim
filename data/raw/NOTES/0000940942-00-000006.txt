21           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders of Hub Group, Inc.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hub
Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standard in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hub Group,
Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its operations and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule on page S-1 is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
BUSINESS: Hub Group, Inc. the Company provides intermodal transportation
services utilizing primarily third party arrangements with railroads and drayage
companies. The Company also arranges for transportation of freight by truck
and performs logistics services.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Hub Group, Inc. and all entities in which the Company has more than
a 50% equity ownership or otherwise exercises unilateral control. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers as cash equivalents all highly
liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less. Checks
outstanding, net, of approximately $13,638,000 and $1,482,000 at December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively, are included in accounts payable.
RECEIVABLES: The Company reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable was
approximately $2,134,000 and $691,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line and various
accelerated methods at rates adequate to depreciate the cost of applicable
assets over their expected useful lives: buildings and improvements, 15 to 40
years; leasehold improvements, the shorter of useful life or lease term;
computer equipment and software, 3 to 5 years; furniture and equipment, 3 to 10
years; and transportation equipment and automobiles, 3 to 12 years. Direct costs
related to internally developed software projects are capitalized and amortized
over their expected useful life on a straight-line basis not to exceed five
years, commencing when the asset is placed into service. Maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred and major improvements are capitalized.
The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the accumulated
depreciation thereon are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss
realized upon sale or disposal charged or credited to operations.
GOODWILL: Goodwill is amortized on the straight-line method over 40 years. On an
ongoing basis, the Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows before
interest of the operating units to which goodwill relates in order to evaluate
impairment. If impairment exists, the carrying amount of the goodwill is reduced
by the estimated shortfall of cash flows. The Company has not experienced any
impairment of goodwill. Accumulated goodwill amortization was $10,032,000 and
$4,963,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK: The Company financial instruments that are
exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and temporary
investments with high quality financial institutions. At times, such investments
may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. Temporary investments are valued
at the lower of cost or market and at the balance sheet dates approximate fair
market value. The Company primarily serves customers located throughout the
United States with no significant concentration in any one region. No one
customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 1997, 1998 or 1999. The
Company reviews a customer credit history before extending credit. In
addition, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers
and, as a consequence, believes that its trade accounts receivable risk is
limited.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenue represents sales of services to customers.
Revenue is recognized based on relative transit time.
INCOME TAXES: The Company accounts for certain income and expense items
differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets                    27 and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE: In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128 Statement 128, Earnings per Share, basic earnings per
common share are based on the average quarterly weighted average number of Class
A and Class B shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common
share are adjusted for the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options. In
computing the per share effect of assumed exercise, funds which would have been
received from the exercise of options, including tax benefits assumed to be
realized, are considered to have been used to purchase shares at current market
prices, and the resulting net additional shares are included in the calculation
of weighted average shares outstanding.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
Statement 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This standard requires that an entity recognize derivatives as
either assets or liabilities on its balance sheet and measure those instruments
at fair value. As a result of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.

On March 18, 1996, the Company assumed a line of credit for $5,000,000.
This line of credit was not used at December 31, 1999. Advances on this line of
credit at December 31, 1998, were $2,050,000. At December 31, 1999 and December
31, 1998, the interest rate was 825% and 75%, respectively. The interest rate
is established at the bank discretion at a rate less than or equal to the
bank prime rate. Borrowings are secured by certain assets. The line of credit
has no expiration date.
On April 30, 1999, the Company closed on an unsecured $500 million
five-year revolving line of credit with a bank. The Company can borrow at the
prime rate or up to prime plus 1% on a day-to-day basis or may borrow for 30,
60, 90 or 180 day periods at LIBOR plus 125% to 250% based on the Company
funded debt to EBITDAM earnings before interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation, amortization and minority interest ratio. The credit facility
also contains certain financial covenants which, among others, requires that the                    32 Company maintain required levels of EBITDAM, funded debt to EBITDAM, fixed
charge coverage and current assets to current liabilities. In addition, there
are limitations on additional indebtedness as well as acquisitions and minority
interest purchases. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at
December 31, 1999. Advances on this line of credit at December 31, 1999 were
$340 million with interest rates ranging between 864% and 95% and are
classified as long term debt. At December 31, 1999, there was $160 million
unused and available under the line of credit.
The unsecured term notes have a floating interest rate. The Company can
borrow at the prime rate or up to prime plus 125% on a day-to-day basis or may
borrow for 30, 60, 90 or 180 day periods at LIBOR plus 150% to 275% based on
the Company funded debt to EBITDAM ratio. The unsecured term notes share the
same financial covenants as noted above for the line of credit.
On April 30, 1999, under the term notes and the $500 million line of
credit debt agreement, the Company was required to enter into an interest rate
swap agreement designated as a hedge on a portion of the Company variable rate
debt. The purpose of the swap was to fix the interest rate on a portion of the
variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had an interest rate swap with a notional
amount of $250 million, a weighted average pay rate of 837%, a weighted
average receive rate of 826% and a maturity date of September 30, 2002. This
swap agreement involves the exchange of amounts based on the variable interest
rate for amounts based on the fixed interest rate over the life of the
agreement, without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments
are based. The differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is
accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the debt.
On June 25, 1999, the Company closed on $500 million of private
placement debt. These notes are unsecured and have an eight-year average life
with a coupon interest rate of 864% paid quarterly. The notes contain certain
financial covenants which, among others, requires that the Company maintain
required levels of funded debt to EBITDA earnings before interest expense,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization, fixed charge coverage and current
assets to current liabilities. In addition, there are limitations on additional
indebtedness as well as acquisitions and minority interest purchases. The
Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 1999.
On September 17, 1997, the Company closed on an unsecured $360 million
five-year revolving line of credit with a bank. The Company could borrow at the
prime rate on a day-to-day basis or may borrow for 30, 60, 90 or 180 day periods
at LIBOR plus 080% to 125% based on the Company funded debt to EBITDA ratio.
The credit facility also contained certain financial covenants which, among
others, required that the Company maintain required levels of EBITDA, funded
debt to EBITDA, fixed charge coverage and current assets to current liabilities.
In addition, there were limitations on additional indebtedness as well as
acquisitions and minority interest purchases. The Company was in compliance with
these covenants at December 31, 1998. Advances on this line of credit at
December 31, 1998 were $18,500,000 with interest rates ranging between 634% and
636%. This 1997 line of credit agreement was cancelled in April 1999 when the
new $500 million revolving line of credit described above was obtained.
In October 1996, the Company authorized the issuance of a standby
letter of credit for $1,000,000, which has no expiration date.
33 NOTE 9. RENTAL EXPENSE AND LEASE COMMITMENTS
Minimum annual rental commitments, in thousands, at December 31, 1999,
under noncancellable operating leases, principally for real estate and
equipment, are payable as follows 2000                                $  7,759

2005                                   167
$ 21,165
Total rental expense was approximately $8,840,000, $7,487,000 and
$4,535,000 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Many of the leases contain
renewal options and escalation clauses which require payments of additional rent
to the extent of increases in the related operating costs.
NOTE 10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN
Concurrent with the initial public offering the Company adopted a
Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1996 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of
Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1996 Incentive Plan was
450,000. Concurrent with the secondary offering the Company adopted a second
Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1997 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of
Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1997 Incentive Plan was
150,000. For the purpose of attracting and retaining key executive and
managerial employees, in 1999 the Company adopted a third Long-Term Incentive
Plan the 1999 Incentive Plan. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Incentive Plan was 600,000. Under the 1996,
1997 and 1999 Incentive Plans, stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and performance units may be granted for the purpose of
attracting and motivating key employees and non-employee directors of the
Company. The options granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a
three-year period and expire 10 years after the date of grant. The options
granted to employees vest over a range of three to five years and expire 10
years after the date of grant.
The Company currently utilizes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 in its accounting for stock options. In October 1995, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 Statement 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation. The
accounting method as provided in the pronouncement is not required to be
adopted; however, it is encouraged. The Company provides the disclosure below in
accordance with Statement 123. Had the Company accounted for its stock options

In the second quarter of 1999, a $09 million pretax charge was
recorded due to a change in estimate and an impairment loss relating to certain
operating software applications. Specifically, $07 million of this charge was
attributable to a change in estimate of the useful life for the Visual Movement
software previously used primarily for brokerage. The Visual Movement software
is no longer being used by the Company and was replaced with enhancements to the
Company proprietary intermodal operating software during the second quarter of
1999. These enhancements allow for greater network visibility of loads in a year
2000 compliant program. The $02 million impairment loss related to the
write-down of a logistics software program. The fair value was determined based
on the estimated future cash flows attributable to the single customer using
this program. The Company has installed this software package and is currently
preparing the software for its operational applications. This new software will
provide enhanced functionality.
