Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of June 28, 2014, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e,
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act were effective to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and instructions for Form 10-K and that such disclosure controls and procedures were also effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive

Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f of the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2014. In
making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in the 1992 framework, Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Our management has concluded that, as of June 28, 2014, our
internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Burr
Pilger Mayer, Inc., which audited the financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, independently assessed the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Burr Pilger Mayer, Inc. has issued an attestation report, which appears as part of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the year ended June 28, 2014 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
