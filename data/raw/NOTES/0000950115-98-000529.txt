The Judge Group, Inc.
Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Judge Group,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and of cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Judge Group,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. March 20, 1998

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Judge Group, Inc. the Company formerly Judge Inc., a Pennsylvania
corporation founded in 1970, provides i information technology IT and
engineering professionals to its clients on both a temporary basis through its
Contract Placement business and a permanent basis through its Permanent
Placement business, ii computer network and document management system
integration, implementation, maintenance and training through its Imaging and
Network Services business and iii information technology training through
its IT Training business on a range of software and network applications to
corporate, governmental and individual clients. At December 31, 1997, the
Company had offices in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut;
Foxborough, Massachusetts; Wakefield, Massachusetts; Tampa, Florida; Moorestown
and Edison, New Jersey; Alexandria, Virginia; and New York, New York. A
substantial portion of the Company revenues are derived from customers located
in the Mid-Atlantic corridor of the United States.
The Contract Placement business includes the operations of three of the
Company wholly-owned subsidiaries, Judge Technical Services, Inc. JTS,
Judge Professional Services, Inc. JPS and Judge Technical Services of N.J.,
Inc. JTNJ.
The Permanent Placement business includes the operations of three of the
Company wholly-owned subsidiaries, Judge, Inc., Judge Electronic Services of
Florida, Inc. JESF and Judge Inc. of New Jersey JINJ.
The IT Training business is comprised of the operations of The Berkeley
Associates Corp. Berkeley, a company acquired by the Company in September
1996 see Note 3.
At December 31, 1995 the Company owned 33%, Martin E. Judge, Jr., the Company
founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owned 47%, and another officer and
director of the Company owned 5% of the outstanding voting shares, on a fully
diluted basis, of Judge Computer Corporation JCC. On December 1, 1995, JCC
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger the JCC/DI Merger Agreement
with DataImage, Inc. DI or Data Image, a public company, the common stock
of which was traded on the over-the-counter market. Pursuant to the JCC/DI
Merger Agreement, JCC was merged into DI on February 29, 1996 the JCC/DI
Merger, and DI, as the surviving corporation, changed its name to Judge
Imaging Systems, Inc. JIS. As a result of the merger, the former
shareholders of JCC held, on a fully diluted basis, a majority of the
outstanding common stock of JIS, which remained a public company.
On September 4, 1996, The Boards of Directors of the Company and JIS approved
the merger of JIS into a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
the Merger. The terms of the Merger called for the conversion of each share
of JIS common stock not already owned by the Company and Series A preferred
stock into $250 of value based on the public offering price of The Judge Group,
Inc. common stock. Based upon the offering price of $750 per share, the Company
issued 1,194,230 shares of The Judge Group, Inc. common stock to the
shareholders of JIS at the closing of its initial public offering in 1997. In
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16 and related
literature, the acquisition by the Company in the Merger of the majority of the
shares of JIS, which were owned by the Company, Martin E. Judge, Jr. or other
owners of the Company securities, was accounted for as a corporate
reorganization of entities under common control, at historical cost, similar to
pooling accounting. However, the acquisition by the Company in the Merger of the
remaining JIS shares the Minority Shares was accounted for in accordance
with purchase accounting whereby the pro rata portion of JIS assets and
liabilities were recorded at their fair values. The excess of the value of the
Company shares issued in exchange for the Minority Shares over the fair value of
the net assets attributable to the minority interest was recorded as goodwill.
The Imaging and Network Services business of the Company consisted of the
operations of JCC prior to the JCC/DI Merger and JIS subsequent to the merger.
See Notes 12 and 15. In addition, the Company purchased the net assets and
liabilities of Systems Automation, Inc. Systems Automation in September 1996
see Note 3, a company that provides imaging and document management systems
and services.                    29           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS -- Continued
During 1996, the Company engaged an investment banking firm to assist it in an
initial public offering of its common stock. On September 30, 1996, the Company
filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. Effective February 20, 1997 the
Company successfully completed its initial public offering of common shares. The
Company sold 3,000,000 common shares at a price of $750 per share, realizing
approximately $20,906,000 in proceeds net of underwriting discounts and
commissions. Immediately prior to the initial public offering, the holders of
$500,000 of convertible notes exchanged them for 526,000 Company common shares
Note 7. The Company issued 40,000 common shares in lieu of $300,000 of notes
payable to Berkeley, in accordance with the purchase agreement with Berkeley
Note 3. In connection with the initial public offering, the Company incurred
approximately $1,694000 of accounting, legal, printing and other costs as of
December 31, 1997 and such costs have been charged to additional paid-in capital
as a reduction of the proceeds from the initial public offering. As of December
31, 1996 approximately $1,017,000 of such costs which were incurred in 1996 were
included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.
Unless the context indicates otherwise, references to the Company herein prior
to February 29, 1996 include reference to its wholly-owned subsidiaries and JCC
and such references subsequent to February 29, 1996 include reference to its
wholly-owned subsidiaries and JIS.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, JIS and the Company wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include Judge,
JTS, JPS, JTNJ, JESF, Berkeley as of and from the effective date of the
acquisition -- see Note 3 and JINJ. JCC prior to the JCC/DI merger and JIS
subsequent to the JCC/DI merger have been consolidated due to certain elements
of common ownership and control being present. Effective February 20, 1997, JIS
became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Risks and Uncertainties
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition in Contract Placement and Permanent Placement Businesses
The Company recognizes permanent placement revenues at the date employment of
the placed professional commences, subject to reversal and adjustments if such
employment is terminated during a guarantee period. Revenues related to
temporary placement services are recognized on a weekly basis as the services
are performed.
Revenue Recognition in Imaging and Network Services Business
Revenues from the sales of network, imaging and document management systems is
recognized at the date of shipment of the system, provided that any work to
complete installation of the system is routine in nature and related costs,
which are accrued at the time revenue is recognized, are not significant.
However, in instances in which installation and development costs are
significant to the completion of the contract, revenue is recognized on a
percentage-of-completion basis. Revenues recorded on a percentage-of-completion
basis are based upon management estimates for which it is reasonably possible
that such estimates may change in the near term. Revenues billed in advance for
computer sales, warranties and maintenance contracts are deferred and recorded
as income in the period in which the merchandise is shipped or the services are
rendered. Deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
of December 31, 1997 and 1996 includes approximately $184,000 and $20,000,
respectively, of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on
contracts-in-progress.                    30           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Continued
Revenue Recognition in IT Training Business
Tuition and fee revenues are recognized generally when the classes are held.
Payments received prior to the class commencing are recorded as deferred
revenues.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash in bank and other short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions. These balances
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $100,000 at each
institution.
Short-Term Investments
The Company records short-term trading investments at fair market value which
generally equals the cost of such investments. These securities represent
investments in municipal mutual funds $1 par value and/or investments in
municipal bonds with floating interest rates and which allow the Company to
redeem its investment on a weekly basis at its original cost plus accrued
interest. There were no realized gains or losses on these investments in 1997.
Inventories
Inventories of computer and related supplies and equipment held for resale are
valued at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market. Inventories at
December 31, 1997 and 1996 include approximately $619,000 and $131,000,
respectively, of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on
contracts-in-progress.
Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
Accounts receivable at December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995 were net of allowances
for doubtful accounts of $465,000, $661,000, and $174,000, respectively.
Included in accounts receivable was unbilled work-in-process of approximately
$584,000, $524,000 and $655,000 at December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses was
approximately $442,000, $283,000 and $510,000 of accrued employee and contractor
payroll principally relating to unbilled work-in-process at December 31, 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively.
The allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to earnings
in the form of a charge to bad debt expense. Accounts which are determined to be
uncollectible are charged against the allowance account. Management makes
periodic assessments of the adequacy of the allowance which requires the Company
to recognize additions or reductions to the allowance. It is reasonably possible
that factors may change significantly and, therefore, affect management
determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts in the near term. An
analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts follows                         Additions Reversals

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- Continued
Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is
computed on the straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, principally five to ten years for furniture, office
and computer equipment and five years for automotive equipment.
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives of the improvements,
principally five to ten years.
Depreciation and amortization related to property and equipment amounted to
$653,278 in 1997, $451,322 in 1996, and $271,099 in 1995.
Property Under Capital Leases and Amortization
Property under capital leases is stated at the lower of fair market value or net
present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the leases. Property
under capital leases consists of furniture and office equipment and is included
in property and equipment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Amortization is provided over the shorter of the related lease terms or the
estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Income Taxes
Deferred taxes are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The
Statement requires the use of the liability method to account for income taxes.
Deferred income taxes are provided for the difference between the tax basis of
an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements and at
the tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid
or recovered.
Deferred income taxes arise principally from differences between financial and
income tax reporting, including amounts recorded for workers' compensation
funding, amounts recorded for the allowance for doubtful accounts, the
availability of net operating loss carryforwards and certain other temporary
differences.
Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based on
the weight of evidence available, it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the
requirement for a valuation allowance is an estimate which is reasonably
possible to change in the near term.
Intangible Assets
The Restrictive Covenant covenant-not-to-compete was being amortized on a
straight-line method over the life of the covenant forty-eight months, through
August 1996. Amortization expense related to the covenant was approximately
$94,000 for 1996 and approximately $150,000 for 1995. See Note 13.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of companies acquired over the fair
value of their net assets at the date of acquisition and is being amortized on
the straight-line method over ten years for Systems Automation and over fifteen
years for Berkeley and JIS. The Berkeley and Systems Automation acquisitions
were effective September 30, 1996 while the JIS acquisition was effective
February 20, 1997 See Note 3. Amortization of goodwill is based upon
management estimates for which it is reasonably possible that such estimates
may change in the near term. Amortization of goodwill for the period ended
December 31, 1997 and 1996 was approximately $343,000 and $63,000, respectively,
and is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated
statements of operations.                    32           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Deferred Rent Obligation
The Company is party to operating lease agreements for certain of its office
facilities, which contain provisions for free rent for a certain period, with
subsequent rent increases. In accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, the Company records monthly rent expense equal to the total of the
payments due over the lease terms, divided by the number of months of the lease
terms. The difference between rent expense recorded and the amount paid is
credited or charged to deferred rent obligation in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.
Advertising Costs
The Company participates in various advertising programs. All costs related to
advertising are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising expense amounted to
approximately $696,000, $532,000, and $464,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This Statement establishes standards
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components revenues,
expenses, gains and losses in a full set of general-purpose financial
statements. Such items may include foreign currency translation adjustments,
unrealized gains/losses from investing activities, and other transactions. This
Statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under
accounting standards as components of comprehensive income be reported in a
financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other
financial statements. This Statement is required to be adopted for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1997. The adoption of this Statement is not
expected to have a material effect on the Company.
In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. This Statement establishes standards for
the way that public business enterprises report information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial
reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
This Statement is required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997. The Company has not yet determined the effect that this
Statement is expected to have on the Company.
Earnings Per Share
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 FAS
128, Earnings Per Share, beginning in the fourth quarter of 1997. All prior
period earnings per common share were recomputed to conform to the provisions of
FAS 128. The recomputations did not result in any restatements in earnings per
share previously reported.
The number of shares used in the earnings per share calculation and convertible
note share conversion see Note 7 has been adjusted for the 526 for 10 stock
split which occurred in September 1996.
Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on net income, reduced by
dividends earned on preferred stock outstanding on JIS through February 1997
$6,700 and $45,000 for 1997 and 1996, respectively, and divided by the
weighted average number of shares actually outstanding. The number of shares
used in the computation were approximately 12,761,000 in 1997, 8,473,000 in 1996
and 8,416,000 in 1995.
Diluted earnings per share amounts for calendar years 1997, 1996 and 1995 are
based on the weighted average number of shares calculated for basic earnings per
share purposes increased by the number of shares that would be outstanding
assuming conversion of outstanding convertible notes see Note 7 and exercise
of outstanding stock warrants Note 11. The number of shares used in the
computation were approximately 12,826,000 in calendar year 1997, and 9,114,000
in calendar years 1996 and 1995. Options to purchase common stock issued in 1997
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
option exercise price was greater than the average market price of common stock.                    33           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of substantially all of the Company financial
instruments are approximately equal to their carrying values at all periods
presented.
NOTE 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND PRO-FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Effective September 30, 1996, the Company purchased 100% of the issued and
outstanding stock of Berkeley. Berkeley, founded in 1980, is a provider of IT
training services to corporate, governmental and individual clients. The total
original acquisition cost was $2,232,200 payable principally in cash and notes.
In February 1997, upon the successful completion of the initial public offering,
the Company converted $300,000 of the note payable into 40,000 common shares;
paid cash of $635,000, and converted the remaining balance of the note payable 300,000, into a term note payable. A portion of the purchase price was
contingent on Berkeley attaining certain pre-tax income amounts in 1996 and/or
1997. Based on Berkeley 1996 and 1997 pre-tax income, no portion of the
contingent amount was earned; therefore no payment was made in that regard and
the related goodwill and note payable were accordingly reversed in December
1997. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and results of operations
of Berkeley are only included since the purchase date. The excess of acquisition
cost over the fair value of net assets, assumed to equal their carrying value,
was approximately $1,664,000, after adjustment for the contingent portion that
was not earned, which is being amortized over fifteen years, beginning in
October 1996. Operating results for the Company for the year ended December 31,
1996, on a pro forma basis as though Berkeley had been acquired as of January 1,
1996, is shown below.
Also effective September 30, 1996, the Company purchased substantially all of
the tangible and intangible assets, and assumed all of the liabilities, of
Systems Automation. Systems Automation is a provider of advanced technical
solutions to increase the efficiency of business processes, such as network and
document management systems design, integration, implementation, maintenance and
training, business process redesign, project management and advanced
applications development. The total acquisition cost was $547,252 payable in
cash and notes. Upon completion by the Company of the initial public offering,
the remainder of the notes became due and payable in cash within 15 days of the
consummation of such initial public offering. In February 1997, upon the
successful completion of the initial public offering, the Company paid the
balance owing. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and results of
operations of Systems Automation are included since the purchase date. The
excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets, assumed to equal
their carrying value, was approximately $1,040,000, which is being amortized
over ten years, beginning in October 1996. Operating results for the Company for
the year ended December 31, 1996, on a pro forma basis as though Systems
Automation had been acquired as of January 1, 1996, is shown below.
The following sets forth the combined results for the Company, DataImage see
Note 15, Berkeley and Systems Automation for the year ended December 31, 1996,

NOTE 4. NOTE PAYABLE, BANK
Note payable, Bank, consists of advances to the Company, JTS and JIS under a
$11,000,000 credit facility at December 31, 1997. At December 31, 1997, this
line of credit bore interest at the bank prime rate 85% at December 31,
1997 and maximum permitted borrowings thereunder was the lesser of $11,000,000
or 80% of qualified accounts receivable, as defined in the line of credit
agreement. The line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of the
Company assets, and is subject to certain financial covenants. In addition,
the Company and all of its subsidiaries are jointly and severally responsible
for all of the debt outstanding under the line. In February 1997, upon
completion of the initial public offering, the Company repaid all obligations
related to its note payable, bank. In accordance with the line of credit
agreement, the Company has the full amount available for future borrowing needs.
Included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at December 31, 1996 were
approximately $1,858,000 of bank overdrafts.                    35           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 7. CONVERTIBLE NOTES
In 1994, the Company received $500,000 from a group of investors in the form of
10% convertible senior subordinated promissory notes. The notes were exchanged
for 526,000 Company common shares, immediately prior to the offering see Note
1. The notes bear 10% interest per annum and were scheduled to mature in July
1997. Since the Company effected a successful initial public offering before
July 31, 1997, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement, the financial
advisor who arranged such financing was paid a fee equal to 1% of the proceeds
of the initial public offering approximately $225,000 in February 1997.
NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return with most of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. In prior years, JTS and JCC/JIS were not included in
the Company consolidated Federal income tax return, as the Company owned less
than 80% of each such Company outstanding common shares. Under Internal
Revenue regulations, JTS and JCC/JIS were not part of the consolidated group for
tax purposes and filed their own Federal income tax returns. Effective January
1, 1997, JTS began filing as part of the consolidated group and effective
February 20, 1997, JIS began filing as part of the consolidated group. State
income taxes are determined on the basis of filing separate returns for each
company as required by the applicable state regulations.
The net deferred tax asset at December 31, 1997 and 1996 included the following                           1997      1996

subsequent to February 20, 1997 have been used in the consolidated tax accrual.
For income tax reporting purposes, as of December 31, 1997, JIS had an unused
operating loss carryforward of approximately $4,200,000, which may be applied
against future taxable income of JIS, subject to certain Federal income tax
limitations. These carryforwards expire between 2002 and 2012.
NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company and its subsidiaries lease office facilities under operating lease

The Company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in
existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches. The Year 2000 problem
is pervasive and complex, as many computer systems will be affected in some way
by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 00. Systems that do not properly
recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to
fail. The Year 2000 issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen
problems in its own computer systems and from third parties for whom the Company
implements Year 2000 solutions on their computer systems.
The Company believes its recently implemented financial information system is
Year 2000 compliant. Further, the Company is currently in the process of
replacing its candidate and client databases utilized in its Contract Placement
and Permanent Placement business with software systems that are represented to
be Year 2000 compliant. The Company is analyzing its remaining computer
systems to identify any potential Year 2000 issues and will take appropriate
corrective action based on the results of such analysis. Management has not yet
determined the cost related to achieving Year 2000 compliance. Management
believes, based on its available information, that it will be able to manage its
total Year 2000 transition without any material adverse effects on its
business operations or financial condition.
NOTE 10. RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company had various 401k retirement plans the Plans covering
substantially all employees through June 30, 1996. Employees were able to
contribute a percentage of their pre-tax salary to the Plans. Company
contributions to the Plans were at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
There were no Company contributions charged to operations related to the Plans
in 1996 and 1995. Effective July 1, 1996, all the Plans were merged into one
Plan. The new Plan has no Company contribution provision, although employees may
continue to contribute a percentage of their pre-tax salary to the Plan.

Dividends
In accordance with the provisions of its line of credit, the Company is not
permitted to declare or pay any cash dividends on its common stock see Note 4.
Additional Paid-In Capital
During 1996, additional paid-in capital decreased due to the JCC/DI merger which
was accounted for as a reverse acquisition Notes 12 and 15.
Capital Structure
On September 4, 1996, the Company Board of Directors voted to i modify the
Company capital structure to increase the number of authorized common shares
to 50,000,000, ii adjust the par value per share from $005 to $01, iii
authorize the issuance of 10,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $01

the formation of a new subsidiary, Judge, Inc., and the contribution of
substantially all the assets related to the Permanent Placement business to this
new subsidiary.
Common Shares -- Warrants
During 1993, the Company issued to a financial advisor warrants to purchase

Stock Option Plan
On September 4, 1996 the Company adopted an Incentive Stock Option and
Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan the Incentive Plan for key employees and
non-employee directors. Options may be granted under the Incentive Plan to
purchase up to a maximum of 1,500,000 of the Company common shares, subject to
certain adjustments and restrictions. The price of each option shall be the fair
market value of the shares on the date of the grant. The options granted are
subject to a four year vesting schedule in equal increments annually, and are
exercisable any time after vesting up to 10 years from grant date.
During 1997, the Company granted two non-employee directors options to purchase
10,000 common shares each at an exercise price of $325 under the Non-Qualified
Stock Option Plan.
A summary of the Company Incentive Stock Option Plan activity for common
shares for the year ended December 31, 1997 there were no options granted in
1996 follows                    Number of Shares    Weighted Average Exercise Price

The Company accounts for its Incentive Plan in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized for the Incentive Plan. Had
compensation cost been determined in accordance with the fair value method of
Statement of Financial Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, the Company pro forma net income and net income per
share for the year ended December 31, 1997 would be as follows Net Income:
As reported         $ 2,711,940
Pro forma          $ 2,117,278
Basic earnings per share:
As reported           $ 021
Pro forma            $ 017
The resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to
be expected in future years.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 1997: risk-free interest rate of 592%, expected
dividend yields of 0%, expected life of five years from date of grant, and
expected price volatility of 57%. Since the Company had no history of volatility
at the time the options were granted, a weighted average historical volatility
of similar companies following a comparable period in their lives was used. The
weighted average fair value of the options granted in 1997 was $399.

Preferred Shares
During 1991, the capital structure of JCC was modified to authorize 10,000,000
$10 par value preferred shares. During 1991, $100,000 of debentures and
$266,577 of investor loans payable were converted to 1,000,000 and 2,665,770
preferred shares, respectively. Accrued interest of approximately $97,000
relating to these payables was contributed to capital.
The JCC preferred shares bore cumulative dividends at an annual rate of $005
per share. Cumulative dividends in arrears at December 31, 1995 were
approximately $74,000. No dividends were declared or paid in 1996, 1995, or
1994. In February 1996, the preferred shareholders waived receipt of all
dividends due them. In February 1996, the preferred shareholders converted their
preferred shares into JCC common shares on a one-to-one basis.
At December 31, 1995, these preferred shares were eliminated in consolidation
and were presented at no value in minority interest, due to the extent of JCC
shareholders' deficit at December 31, 1995.
In February 1996, JCC Board of Directors authorized new additional preferred
shares, consisting of 1,125,000 $01 par value Series A convertible preferred
shares and 25,000, $1,000 stated value Series B preferred shares.
In February 1996, JCC raised approximately $888,000 $1,097,000 net of $209,000
in costs in a private offering of 822,628 Series A convertible preferred shares
JCC Series A Preferred at a purchase price per share of $133. The JCC
Series A Preferred shares were convertible into JCC common shares at the
holder option, and conversion was mandatory at the time of a subsequent public
offering of common shares by JCC in excess of $5 million. The JCC Series A
Preferred shares carried a cumulative dividend of 7% per year aggregating
approximately $45,000 at December 31, 1996, and holders had a liquidation
preference prior to the common shareholders and all other existing classes. At
the effective time of the JCC/DI Merger, these preferred shares were converted
into the same number of JIS Series A preferred shares JIS Series A Preferred
with essentially the same rights and privileges. At December 31, 1996, the JIS
Series A Preferred stock is presented at $-0- as minority interest in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Approximately $888,000 of JIS losses
were allocated to this minority interest in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1996.
In February 1996, and at the effective time of the JCC/DI Merger, advances from
the Company to JCC in the aggregate of $1,520,000 were converted into 1,500
Series B preferred shares of JCC, which were immediately converted into the same
number of shares of Series B preferred stock of JIS. The JIS Series B preferred
stock carried a cumulative annual dividend of 10%, was not convertible, did not
have a liquidation preference and was subject to mandatory redemption. These
shares were eliminated in consolidation.
Subsequent to December 31, 1996 and concurrent with the successful completion of
the initial public offering, the series A Preferred stock was converted into JIS
common stock, then into the Company common stock, in accordance with the
merger agreement. The series B Preferred stock was canceled.
NOTE 13. STOCK REDEMPTION JTS
An employee of JTS the Minority Shareholder acquired an aggregate of 400
common shares of JTS over a period of time ending in 1990. The aggregate
purchase price for these shares was paid by the Minority Shareholder in the form
of unsecured promissory notes. On August 12, 1992, JTS redeemed the Minority
Shareholder shares for $266,000. In addition, in connection with this
redemption, JTS agreed to pay the Minority Shareholder $13,527 per month for six
years $950,000 in the aggregate. The restrictive covenant set forth in the
agreement and the related liability were recorded at the net present value of
the payments, at an assumed interest rate of 8% or $752,539. During August
1996, JTS reached a settlement agreement with the minority shareholder.
Accordingly, two outstanding notes were settled for $322,000, which was less
than the aggregate face value, which resulted in a gain of approximately
$27,000.                    41           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTE 15. BUSINESS COMBINATION THE JCC/DI MERGER
On September 13, 1995, JCC and DI signed a Letter of Intent relating to the
JCC/DI Merger. On December 1, 1995, JCC and DI executed the JCC/DI Merger
Agreement, which was amended effective December 20, 1995 and February 26, 1996.
The JCC/DI Merger was consummated effective February 29, 1996.
In the JCC/DI Merger, JCC was merged into DI. DI survived the merger and changed
its name to JIS. JIS continued to be a public reporting company. In connection
with the merger, the Certificate of Incorporation of JIS was amended to increase
its authorized capital by 1,125,000 shares of $01 value JIS Series A Preferred
stock, 1,500 shares of $1,000 stated value Series B preferred stock the JIS
Series B Preferred and 3,873,500 shares of blank check preferred stock for
an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of new preferred stock. The JIS Series A
Preferred and JIS Series B Preferred stock have essentially the same rights and
privileges as the JCC Series A Preferred shares and JCC Series B Preferred
shares existing immediately prior to the merger.
In the JCC/DI Merger, each stockholder of DI received one share of JIS common
stock for every 3196 shares of DI common stock held thereby immediately prior
to the merger, and each shareholder of JCC received one share of JIS common
stock for every 283 common shares of JCC held thereby immediately prior to the
merger. In addition, the JCC Series A Preferred shares and the JCC Series B
Preferred shares outstanding prior to the JCC/DI Merger were converted into the
same numbers of JIS Series A Preferred and JIS Series B Preferred shares,
respectively.
The conversion ratios were calculated so that, after giving effect to certain
reserved shares for issuance to employees following the merger and assuming the
sale of the maximum of 1,125,000 JCC Series A Preferred shares offered in JCC
1995 private offering 822,628 were actually sold and the conversion of such
maximum number of JCC Series A Preferred shares into JCC common shares, there
would be approximately 5,000,000 shares of common stock of JIS outstanding
immediately following the merger, of which holders of DI common stock
immediately prior to the merger were to receive in the aggregate approximately
5% approximately 250,000 shares and the holders of JCC common shares and JCC
Series A Preferred shares immediately prior to the merger were to receive in the
aggregate approximately 95% approximately 4,750,000 shares. The JCC Series B
Preferred stock was not included in the foregoing percentage calculations.
The JCC/DI Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby JCC, in
substance, acquired DI, allocating the fair value of JCC shares exchanged over
the relative fair value of assets and liabilities of DI assumed to equal its
book value prior to the merger. No value was ascribed to DI net loss
carryforwards as a result of limitations on these carryforwards subsequent to
the change in control. Accordingly, the historical financial statements included
in the consolidation prior to the acquisition are those of the acquirer, JCC,
and are those of JIS for the period subsequent to the merger.                    43           THE JUDGE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
