Based on the Evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Companys
Disclosure Controls are effective in timely alerting them to material
information required to be included in the Companys periodic SEC reports. Changes in Internal Control Internal controls for financial reporting were also evaluated and there have
been no significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date of their last
evaluation. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. PART III
