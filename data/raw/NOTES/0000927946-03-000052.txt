responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Indianapolis, Indiana

A capital lease obligation of approximately $255 was incurred in the first quarter of 2002 when the
Company entered into a lease for new computers.       The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 28 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Made2Manage Systems, Inc. the Company, an Indiana corporation
formed in 1986, develops,  markets,  licenses and supports comprehensive
enterprise software for small and midsize manufacturers located primarily in the
United States. The Company is dependent upon its principal product, the
Made2Manage Enterprise Business System, which provides fully
integrated solutions automating major business processes used by manufacturers,
from selling and design, to manufacturing and distribution, finance and human
resources, and customer service and support. This comprehensive enterprise
business  system  features  Made2Manage  Enterprise  Resource  Planning
M2M ERP, Made2Manage Supply Chain Management M2M
SCM, Made2Manage Customer Relationship Management M2M CRM,
Made2Manage Business Intelligence M2M BI, Made2Manage Business
Collaboration M2M VIP and Made2Manage Enterprise Integration
M2M Link. The system is supported by a host of user services,
including M2M Expert, the Web site that provides the Companys customers
with Internet resources including support services 24 hours per day, seven days
a week, cyber-consulting, and virtual education courses. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries.  All material  intercompany  accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of consolidated  financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Certain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2002
presentation. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value. Marketable securities consist of debt instruments with maturities between three
and twelve months and are classified as available-for-sale. In 2002 marketable
securities were recorded at cost, which approximated fair value. In 2001,
marketable securities were recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains
reported in shareholders equity. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related
lease or estimated useful life. All other assets are depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives which range from two to
ten years. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized Software The Company accounts for computer software development costs in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Costs
incurred prior to establishing the technological feasibility of computer
software products and enhancements and those incurred after general release to
customers are expensed. Software development costs incurred by the Company
following technological feasibility, defined by the Company as the existence of
a working model of the product, and prior to the time the product is available
for general release to customers, have not been material and, therefore, have
not been capitalized in 2002 or 2001. 
29 The Company accounts for costs associated with internal-use software in
accordance with Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Certain costs
associated with internal-use  software are capitalized and are generally
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, generally
three to five years, beginning when the asset is substantially ready for use. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets such as property and equipment and capitalized software are
reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss
would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its
carrying amount. Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Income tax
expense is provided based on income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes
reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities
recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax
purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax
rates. The Company records valuation allowances related to its deferred income
tax assets when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized
within the same period of time in which the loss arose. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue The  Companys  revenue  recognition  policy is consistent with the
requirements of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements SAB 101, Statement of Position No. 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SoP 97-2, and other applicable
revenue recognition guidance and interpretations. In general, the Company
records revenue when it is realized, or realizable, and earned. Revenues from
software licenses and hardware are recognized upon shipment, delivery or
customer acceptance, based upon the substance of the arrangement or as defined
in the sales agreement provided there are no significant remaining vendor
obligations to be fulfilled and collectibility is reasonably assured. Software
revenues are generated from licensing software to new customers and from
licensing additional users and new applications to existing customers. Hardware
revenues are generated primarily from the sale of bar-code and data collection
equipment used in connection with the Made2Manage Enterprise Business System and
constitute a relatively small component of total revenues. The Companys sales arrangements typically include services in addition to
software and hardware.  Service revenues are generated from support and
maintenance agreements and also from implementation, education, consulting, and
customization services. For sales arrangements that include bundled software,
hardware and services, the Company accounts for any undelivered service offering
as a separate element of a multiple-element arrangement. These services are
usually not essential to the functionality of the software and hardware. Amounts
deferred for services are determined based upon vendor-specific objective
evidence of the fair value of the elements as prescribed in SoP 97-2. Support
revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement.
Revenues from implementation, education, consulting, and customization services
are recognized as provided to customers. If the services are essential to the
functionality of the software and hardware, revenue from the software and
hardware components is deferred until the essential services are complete. Subscription-based offerings include support and maintenance as described above,
M2M Express, M2M VIP and M2M University. The M2M Express thin client option is
designed to provide small and midsize manufacturing companies access to the
Made2Manage Enterprise Business System via the Internet through a hosted
application service provider. The M2M VIP enterprise portal offers manufacturing
companies a range of collaborative opportunities with their customers, sales
channels and suppliers.  M2M University provides flexible,  comprehensive
educational opportunities to customers via the Web and also through traditional
classroom training. Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the
subscription period. 
30 Net Loss Income per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is determined in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share
SFAS 128, and is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The
calculation of diluted EPS is similar to basic, except that the weighted-average
number of shares outstanding includes the impact of common equivalent shares.
Diluted common equivalent shares consist of stock options using the treasury
stock method as prescribed by SFAS 128. Common equivalent shares are included
in the diluted EPS calculation when dilutive. Under the treasury stock method,
the assumed proceeds from the exercise of stock options are applied solely to
the repurchase of common stock. No options were included in the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended
December 31, 2002, since the Company had a net loss for the year. Otherwise,
options to purchase approximately 990,000 shares of common stock would have been
included in the computation of diluted EPS, which translates into approximately
252,000 common equivalent shares, net of shares repurchased under the treasury
stock method. Options to purchase approximately 13 million shares of common
stock would not have been included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of
common shares. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation using the intrinsic
value-based method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related
interpretations, which require compensation expense for options to be recognized
when the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the
date of grant. Additionally, the Company follows disclosure provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 123,  Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation SFAS 123, and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure  an amendment of FAS 123 SFAS
148. The following table presents pro forma net loss had compensation
cost been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards under
the plan in accordance with SFAS 123.                                   Year Ended December 31,
2002     2001     2000
Net loss as reported                   $  690  $ 4,725  $ 2,547
Compensation expense included in reported net loss                    Compensation expense under FAS 123             1,111    886   1,239
Pro forma net loss                    $ 1,801  $ 5,611  $ 3,786
Pro forma net loss per diluted share           $ 037  $  116  $ 080
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model with the  following  weighted-average
assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 31% for 2002, 49% for 2001 and 625%
for 2000; expected life of two years beyond vesting date; and volatility of 89%
for 2002, 70% for 2001 and 67% for 2000. Based on the  Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, the weighted-average fair value at grant date of options
granted for the years ended December 31 were $466 in 2002, $230 in 2001 and
$457 in 2000. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, on January
1, 2002. SFAS 142 provides guidance on the financial accounting and reporting
for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets upon their initial acquisition
and also subsequent to their acquisition. SFAS 142 states that an intangible
asset with a finite useful life should be amortized over that life. Goodwill and
an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should not be amortized;
however, they should be tested for impairment at least annually. At December 31, 2001, the balance of the Companys goodwill asset
associated with the Bridgeware acquisition was $186,000. In accordance with the
requirements of SFAS 142, the Company ceased amortization of its goodwill asset
effective January 1, 2002. Prior to that, the amortization of goodwill was
$52,000 annually in 2001 and 2000. As required by the adoption of SFAS 142, the
Company employed the transitional goodwill impairment test and determined that
there is no impairment loss of its goodwill asset. 
31 In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Exit or
Disposal Activities  SFAS  146.  SFAS 146 addresses the
recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit
and disposal activities, including costs related to terminating a contract that
is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are
involuntarily  terminated receive under the terms of a one-time benefit
arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual
deferred-compensation contract. SFAS 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring and requires liabilities associated with exit and
disposal activities to be expensed as incurred. SFAS 146 will be effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. At this
time, the Company does not expect this standard to have any material impact on
its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure
an amendment of FAS 123 SFAS 148. SFAS 148 is intended
to encourage the adoption of the accounting provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123, by providing three transition methods  the
prospective method, modified prospective method and retroactive restatement
method. SFAS 148 also mandates certain new disclosures that are incremental to
those required by SFAS 123 for those companies that choose not to adopt the
accounting provisions of SFAS 123. The transition and annual disclosure
provisions of SFAS 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2002. At this time, the Company has elected not to adopt the accounting
provisions of SFAS 123. However, the Company has disclosed the incremental
information as required by SFAS 148 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-14, Income
Statement   Characterization   of   Reimbursements   Received   for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred EITF 01-14, in the
first quarter of 2002. EITF 01-14 states that reimbursements received for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the income
statement versus as a reduction of expenses incurred. As required by the
adoption of EITF 01-14, the Company has reclassified the reimbursements of
out-of-pocket expenses in prior periods from a reduction of cost of services to
services revenue in the consolidated financial statements. 2.Restructuring Charge During the first quarter of 2001, management approved a restructuring plan
designed to align the Companys operations with the current technological
and economic environment. Elements of the restructuring plan included 1
facilities rationalization as a result of increased market acceptance of the
Companys online education offerings, 2 cost reductions associated with
M2M VIP after the significant initial investment made in 2000 and 3 16
employee separations across most functional areas of the company. In connection
with the restructuring, the Company recorded a $16 million pre-tax charge
comprised of restructuring liabilities of $811,000 and related asset impairments
of $781,000. The total $16 million pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2001
was recorded as $640,000 in costs of revenues and $952,000 in operating
expenses. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company completed its restructuring
activities and determined that $198,000 of restructuring liabilities originally
set aside in connection with M2M VIP will probably not be incurred and paid.
This amount has been accounted for as a reduction of costs of revenues in the
consolidated statement of operations for 2002. Of the remaining $613,000
expected to be settled in cash, $512,000 was paid as of December 31, 2002,
consisting  of $457,000 in 2001 and $55,000 in 2002.  The  outstanding
restructuring liabilities of $101,000 are recorded as a current liability in the
2002 consolidated balance sheet and represent the Companys best estimate
of non-recoverable costs and expenses associated with sublet facilities. 32 3.Acquisition In August 1998, the Company acquired its subsidiary, Bridgeware, Inc., which
gave rise to a purchased technology asset and related goodwill. During the third
quarter of 2000, the Company decided to accelerate development of an integrated
multi-level planning suite which largely replaced the acquired technology. That
decision resulted in an impairment of the purchased technology asset and related
goodwill, which were written down to net realizable value. The non-cash, pre-tax
write-down was $20 million. The after-tax effect of the charge was $15
million. 4.Cash  and  Cash  Equivalents  and  Marketable

$54 million for federal and $71 million for state income tax reporting
purposes  that expire in the years 2010  through  2021,  research  and
experimentation tax credits of $975,000 that expire commencing in 2009, and
minimum tax credit carryforwards of $1,000. Although the loss carryforwards
substantially do not begin to expire until 2019, current economic conditions
make it difficult to predict full recoverability of those tax assets in a period
comparable to the period over which they originated. A valuation allowance has
been recorded against the $37 million of deferred tax assets to reflect that
uncertainty. 7.Shareholders Equity Preferred Stock Authorized preferred stock is issuable in series under such terms and conditions
as the Board of Directors may determine. None have been issued to date. Common Stock Options The Companys 1999 Employee Stock Option Plan the 1999 Stock Option
Plan was approved by the shareholders and adopted in April 1999, amended
in April 2000, and authorizes the granting of incentive and non-qualified stock
options. No additional options will be granted under the Companys previous
Employee Stock Option Plan, which was originally adopted in 1990 the 1990
Stock Option Plan, and there are no other equity compensation plans
approved by the shareholders or otherwise. Initially 200,000 shares were
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Stock Option Plan with automatic increases
on January 1 of each year equal to 7% of the base shares. The base shares are
equal to the sum of 1 the number of shares of the Companys common stock
outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year and 2 the number of
shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options
outstanding on the last day of the preceding fiscal year. The exercise price of
the options must not be less than the fair market value of the common stock for
options. Options granted under the 1999 Stock Option Plan generally vest over
four years, with 25% exercisable one year from date of grant and the remaining
75% at the rate of 1/48th of the amount granted in each of the next 36
consecutive months. Options granted prior to 1996 generally expire five years
from the date of grant and options granted subsequently expire ten years from
date of grant. The April 2000 amendment to the 1999 Stock Option Plan authorizes
the grant of options under the 1999 Stock Option Plan covering an additional
number of shares equal to the number of shares covered by unexercised options
that were forfeited under the 1990 Stock Option Plan. The 1999 Stock Option Plan
terminates in 2009. At December 31, 2002, options for 681,950 shares of common stock were available
for future grants under the plan, which include the additional shares authorized
per the April 2000 amendment to the 1999 Stock Option Plan. In accordance with
the provisions of the plan, the number of shares  available for grant
automatically increased by 496,270 shares to 1,178,220 shares on January 1,
2003, representing the aggregate of the calculated 7% of base shares and the
available shares at December 31, 2002. Activity in the option plan is summarized as follows                        2002           2001            2000

Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Stock Purchase
Plan was established in October 1997 and amended in April 2002 to
increase the number of shares reserved for issuance by an additional 100,000
shares, to a total of 200,000 shares. Under the Stock Purchase Plan, employees
are granted the right to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share
that is equal to the greater of 1 85% of the beginning of the quarter market
price or 2 90% of the average market price during the quarter. Purchases are
made at the end of each fiscal quarter. Cumulative shares issued under this plan
totaled 90,641, 75,481, and 49,030 at December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. 8.Employee Savings Plan The Company has an employee savings plan that is qualified under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan covers substantially all employees who
meet minimum age requirements and allows participants to defer a portion of
their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. Company contributions to the plan
may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
approved a matching contribution of 375% of the first 6% of the employees
contributions beginning January 2001. Prior to this, the Board of Directors had
approved a matching  contribution  of 25% of the first 6% of employee
contributions beginning January 1996. The Companys matching contribution
to the savings plan was $269,000 in 2002, $281,000 in 2001 and $173,000 in 2000. 9.Commitments The Company leases office space under long-term operating leases. The Company
has sublet certain of these properties to others as a result of facilities
rationalization  associated with the increased market  acceptance of the
Companys online education offerings. In the first quarter of 2002, the
Company also entered into a capital lease for new computers. Future minimum
lease payments required under these non-cancelable leases, net of receipts from
sublease agreements and amounts representing interest, are as follows in

each of the eight quarters in the two-year period ended December 31, 2002. This
information has been prepared by the Company on the same basis as the
Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this report and
includes, in the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting only of
normal recurring  adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the
information when read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements
and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The Companys operating
results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any
future period. Earnings per share EPS for each quarter are computed independently of EPS for
the year. The sum of the quarterly EPS may not equal the EPS for the year
because of 1 transactions affecting the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding in each quarter and 2 the uneven distribution of earnings during
the year.                                Quarter Ended Unaudited
