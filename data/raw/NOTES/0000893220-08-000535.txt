35   Managements
Responsibility for Financial Statements   Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
the consolidated financial statements and related information.
The statements are prepared in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied and include certain amounts based on managements
best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
financial statements.   In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
financial information, management maintains a system of internal
accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
division of responsibility and the application of written
policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
preparation of reliable financial data.   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and
presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however,
there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
system of internal controls.   Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Companys activities according to the highest standards of
personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
of the Company for its 2008 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have
direct access to the Audit Committee.   The Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst Young LLP, is engaged to render an
opinion as to whether managements financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys
financial position and operating results. This report is
included on page38.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting   Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007 based on the
framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2007.   The Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears on page37.   AMETEK, Inc.   February27, 2008   
36   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING   The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.   We have audited AMETEK, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. AMETEK, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders equity
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007, and our report dated February27,
2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ERNST

37   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
AMETEK, Inc. as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
stockholders equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2007. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at December31, 2007 and
2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles.   As discussed in Notes1 and 10, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, effective January1, 2007. Also, as
discussed in Note11, the Company adopted the balance sheet
recognition and disclosure requirements of
SFASNo158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans as
of December31, 2006.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States,
AMETEK, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as
of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February27, 2008 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ERNST

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1.
Significant
Accounting Policies   Basis of
Consolidation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
the Company, and include the accounts of the
Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany
transactions in the consolidation. The Companys
investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures are accounted
for by the equity method of accounting. Such investments are not
significant to the Companys consolidated results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Cash
Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments   All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, all of the Companys
equity securities and fixed-income securities primarily those
of a captive insurance subsidiary are classified as
available for sale, although the Company may hold
fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate
market value of equity and fixed-income securities at
December31, 2007 and 2006 was: 2007
$179million $163million amortized cost and
2006 $169million $157million
amortized cost. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such
securities is recorded as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders equity, and
is not material. The Company had no other-than-temporary
impairment losses in 2007 or 2006. Certain of the Companys
other investments, which are not significant, are accounted for
by the equity method of accounting as discussed above.   Accounts
Receivable   The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
receivables is recorded against the amount due from these
customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
specific receivables are past due based on past experience. The
allowance for possible losses on receivables was
$64million and $74million at December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note5.   Inventories   The Company uses the
first-in,
first-out FIFO method of accounting, which approximates
current replacement cost, for approximately 62% of its
inventories. The
last-in,
first-out LIFO method of accounting is used to determine cost
for the remaining 38% of our inventory. For inventories where
cost is determined by the LIFO method, the excess of the FIFO
value over the LIFO value was approximately $356million
and $341million at December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves
for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current
assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers
who may be experiencing financial difficulties, and related
management initiatives.   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies,
and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
principally on a straight-line basis over

NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of
lives for depreciable assets is generally 3 to 10years for
machinery and equipment, 5 to 27years for leasehold
improvements and 25 to 50years for buildings.   Revenue
Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period
when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when
products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of
an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have
been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and
pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of
sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery,
we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all
other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The policy, with
respect to sales returns and allowances, generally provides that
the customer may not return products or be given allowances,
except at the Companys option. We have agreements with
distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for
unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the
Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the
distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales
incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume
discounts. The Company accounts for these sales incentives as a
reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the income
statement. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances, and
estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is
recognized based upon past experience. At December31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, the accrual for future warranty obligations
was $144million, $109million and
$94million, respectively. The Companys expense for
warranty obligations approximated $113million in 2007,
$76million in 2006 and $72million in 2005. The
warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the
Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed
one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision
based on past warranty experience, and adjustments are made
periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses.   Research
and Development   Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred and during the past three years were:
2007-$529million, 2006-$420million and
2005-$348million.   Shipping
and Handling Costs   Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales, and
were: 2007 $275million, 2006
$235million, and 2005 $200million.   Earnings
per Share   The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
average number of common shares considered outstanding during
the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share
reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities
principally outstanding common stock options and restricted
stock grants. The following table presents the number of shares

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   the Company and its subsidiaries are made in currencies other
than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from
those transactions are included in operating results for the
year.   The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
instruments. Foreign currency forward contracts are entered into
from time to time to hedge specific firm commitments for certain
inventory purchases or export sales, thereby minimizing the
Companys exposure to foreign currency fluctuation. At
December31, 2007, the Company was a party to certain
foreign currency forward contracts, which were not significant.
These forward contracts were acquired as a part of a 2007
acquisition. The last of these forward contracts is expected to
settle as of January31, 2008. No forward contracts were
outstanding at December31, 2006. In instances where
transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the
gains and losses on those transactions are included in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income AOCI within
stockholders equity to the extent they are effective as
hedges. The Company has designated certain
foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of the net
investment in certain foreign operations. These net investment
hedges are the Companys British-pound-denominated
long-term debt and euro-denominated long-term debt, pertaining
to certain European acquisitions whose functional currencies are
either the British pound or the euro. These acquisitions were
financed by foreign-currency-denominated borrowings under
AMETEKs revolving credit facility and were subsequently
refinanced with long-term private placement debt. These
borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each
of the foreign subsidiaries on their respective dates of
acquisition. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, permits hedging the foreign currency
exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. In
accordance with SFAS133, on the respective dates of
acquisition, the Company designated the British pound- and
euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments
to offset foreign exchange gains or losses on the net investment
in the acquired business due to changes in the British pound and
euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges were evidenced
by managements documentation supporting the
contemporaneous hedge designation on the acquisition dates. As
required by SFAS133, any gain or loss on the hedging
instrument following hedge designation the debt, is reported
in AOCI in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the
investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to
measure hedge effectiveness. As of December31, 2007 and
2006, all net investment hedges were effective. At
December31, 2007, the translation gains on the net
carrying value of the foreign-currency-denominated investments
exceeded the translation losses on the carrying value of the
underlying debt and are included in AOCI. An evaluation of hedge
effectiveness is performed by the Company on an ongoing basis
and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate.   At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
$2032million and $2279million, respectively, of
British pound-denominated loans, which are designated as a hedge
against the net investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in
2006, 2004 and 2003. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the
Company had $730million and $660million of
euro-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against
the net investment in a foreign subsidiary acquired in 2005. As
a result of these British pound- and euro-denominated loans
being designated and effective as net investment hedges,
approximately $96million and $291million of
currency losses have been included in the foreign currency
translation component of other comprehensive income at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
123R. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards
made under its share-based plans. That cost is recognized in the
financial statements over the requisite service period of the
grants. See Note8.   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and other intangible
assets in accordance with SFAS142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. Under SFAS142, purchased goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite

STATEMENTSContinued   lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized;
rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.   Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are
amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents are being
amortized over useful lives of 4 to 20years. Customer
relationships are being amortized over a period of 2 to
20years. Miscellaneous other intangible assets are being
amortized over a period of 13 to 20years. The Company
periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated
useful lives of these intangible assets.   In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives for impairment under SFAS142, a determination of the
fair value of the Companys reporting units and its other
intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based
upon, among other things, estimates of future operating
performance. Changes in market conditions, among other factors,
may have an impact on these estimates. The Company completed its
required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2007,
2006 and 2005 and determined that the carrying values of
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives were
not impaired.   Income
Taxes   The Company adopted the provisions of FIN48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as of January1, 2007.
As a result of the adoption of FIN48, the Company
recognized a $47million increase in liabilities
associated with uncertain tax positions, including interest and
penalties of $24million, a decrease of $12million
in goodwill related to a previous business combination, and a
$59million charge to the January1, 2007, opening
balance of retained earnings. The Company recognizes interest
and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in
income tax expense.   Our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the
related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess
uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize
estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the
world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous
international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax
audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which
is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about
such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and
liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future
adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.   We also are required to assess the realizability of our deferred
tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future
taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and
available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to
realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment,
management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation
allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the extent facts
and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the
valuation allowances may be required.

Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation
No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
FIN48. FIN48 creates a single
model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions, by
prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized in the financial
statements. FIN48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative
effect of adopting FIN48 resulted in a noncash reduction

This amount includes $249million in debt and other
long-term liabilities.   The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits
the Company expects to realize from the acquisitions as follows:
The SCP acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with the
Companys engineered materials, interconnects and packaging
business and extends the Companys reach into new defense
markets. The Advanced acquisition complements the Companys
AMPHION product line of power management products for the
aerospace industry and broadens our product offering in the
power management subsystem market. The BS acquisition
further expands the Companys position in the third-party
aerospace MRO market. The Hamilton acquisition is a strategic
fit with our engineered materials, interconnects and packaging
business and has strong positions in growing specialty metals
niche markets within the aerospace and other industrial markets.
The Cameca acquisition broadens the Companys technical
capabilities in high-end elemental analysis systems used in
advanced laboratory research, semiconductor and nanotechnology
applications. The Umeco RO acquisition broadens the
Companys presence in the European aerospace MRO market,
greatly expanding the range of products and airframe platforms
that the Company supports. The California Instruments
acquisition broadens the scope of our Power Instruments
business, which produces power quality monitoring and metering
instrumentation, and further expands our presence in the
attractive electronic test and measurement equipment market. The
Company expects approximately $235million of the goodwill
recorded on the 2007 acquisitions will be deductible in future
years for tax purposes.   The Company is in the process of completing third-party
valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired,
updating its assessment of an acquired contingent liability
associated with a product liability claim pertaining to Cameca,
as well as finalizing restructuring plans for certain
acquisitions. Adjustments to the allocation of purchase price
will be recorded within the purchase price allocation period of
up to twelve months subsequent to the period of acquisition.
Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price is subject to
revision.   The valuations for the $817million preliminarily assigned
to other intangible assets, related to the 2007 acquisitions,
are currently being finalized by third-party appraisers. In
connection with the finalization of the 2006 acquisitions,
$564million was assigned to intangible assets, which
consisted primarily of patents, technology, customer
relationships and trade names with estimated lives ranging from
five to 20years.   In 2006, the Company spent $1776million, net of cash

facility, all securitized accounts receivable and related debt
are reflected on the Companys consolidated balance sheet.   The special-purpose subsidiary is the servicer of the accounts
receivable under the securitization facility. The accounts
receivable securitization facility was amended and restated in
May 2007 to increase the Companys available borrowing
capacity from $75million to $110million as well as
extend the expiration date from May 2007 to May 2008. The
Company intends to renew the securitization facility on an
annual basis. Interest rates on amounts drawn down are based on
prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper plus a
program fee. The Company also pays a commitment fee on any
unused commitments under the securitization facility. The
Companys accounts receivable securitization is accounted
for as a secured borrowing under SFAS140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities.   At December31, 2007 the Company had no borrowings
outstanding on the accounts receivable securitization. At
December31, 2006, the securitized accounts receivable and
the corresponding debt on the consolidated balance sheet was
$750million. Interest expense under this facility is not
significant. The weighted average interest rate when borrowings
were outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization
during 2007 and 2006 was 57% and 54%, respectively.   In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility,
increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400million
to $550million, which includes an accordion feature that
permits the Company to request up to an additional
$100million in revolving credit commitments at any time
during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain
conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility
from October 2011 to June 2012.   Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit
facility are either at LIBOR or Euribor plus a negotiated
spread, or at the U.S.prime rate. At December31,
2007 the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the
revolving credit facility. At December31, 2006, the
Company had outstanding revolving credit loans of
$967million. The weighted average interest rate on the
revolving credit facility for the periods ended
December31, 2007 and 2006 was 582% and 554   respectively. The Company had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $247million and $272million at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   The revolving credit facility places certain restrictions on
allowable additional indebtedness. At December31, 2007 the
Company had available borrowing capacity of $5253million
under its $550million revolving bank credit facility,
which includes an accordion feature allowing $100million
of additional borrowing capacity.   The private placement, floating-rate term loan, the senior
notes, the revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable
securitization are subject to certain customary covenants,
including financial covenants that, among other things, require
the Company to maintain certain debt to EBITDA and interest
coverage ratios.   Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
facilities with local foreign lenders of approximately
$819million at December31, 2007. Foreign
subsidiaries had debt outstanding at December31, 2007
totaling $561million, including $451million

Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of one
Right for each share of Company common stock owned at the close
of business on June2, 2007, and has authorized the
issuance of one Right for each share of Common Stock of the
Company issued between the Record Date and the Distribution
Date. The Plan provides, under certain conditions involving
acquisition of the Companys common stock, that holders of
Rights, except for the acquiring entity, would be entitled
ito purchase shares of preferred stock at a specified
exercise price, or iito purchase shares of common stock
of the Company, or the acquiring company, having a value of
twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the Plan

Share-Based
Compensation   Under the terms of the Companys stockholder-approved
share-based plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options and
restricted stock awards have been, and may be, issued to the
Companys officers, management-level employees and members
of its Board of Directors. In 2007, the Board of Directors and
the Companys stockholders approved the 2007 Omnibus
Incentive Compensation Plan, which permits the issuance of up to
35million shares of Company common stock. Employee and
nonemployee Director stock options generally vest at a rate of
25% per year, beginning one year from the date of the grant and
restricted stock awards generally have a four-year cliff
vesting. Options primarily have a maximum contractual term of
seven years. At December31, 2007, 87million shares
of Company common stock were reserved for issuance under the
Companys share-based plans, including 38million
shares for stock options outstanding.   The Company issues previously unissued shares when options are
exercised, and shares are issued from treasury stock upon the
award of restricted stock.   Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS123R using the modified retrospective
transition method. Among other things, SFAS123R supersedes
APB 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and
requires companies to measure and record compensation expense
related to all stock awards by recognizing the unamortized grant
date fair value of the awards over their requisite service
periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the
Companys plans that are subject to graded vesting over a
service period, the Company recognizes expense on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the
entire award.   Under the modified retrospective method, compensation cost is
recognized in the financial statements as if the recognition
provisions of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, had been applied to all share-based payments
granted subsequent to the original effective date of
SFAS123 January1, 1995. As such, operating results
for periods prior to 2006 have been retrospectively adjusted
utilizing the fair value of stock options originally determined
for the purpose of providing the pro forma disclosures in the
Companys prior financial statements.

STATEMENTSContinued   During the second quarter of 2007, the Company finalized its
plans to reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries in future international expansion initiatives,
therefore the Company reversed a previously recorded deferred
tax liability of $24million. As of December31,
2007, there is no provision for U.S.deferred income taxes
for the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which
total approximately $1528million. If the company were to
distribute those earnings to the United States, the Company
would be subject to U.S.income taxes based on the excess
of the U.S.statutory rate over statutory rates in the
foreign jurisdiction and withholding taxes payable to the
various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these
undistributed earnings is not practicable.   As of December31, 2007, the Company has tax benefits of
approximately $50million related to net operating loss
carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income
taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations
based on foreign and U.S.tax law. This amount includes net
operating loss carryforwards of $40million for federal
income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of
$37million, and $10million for state income tax
purposes with a valuation allowance of $08million. These
net operating loss carryforwards if not used, will expire
between 2010 and 2030. As of December31, 2007, the Company
has U.S.and foreign tax credit carry forwards of
approximately $31million which begin to expire in 2014.   The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain
deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to
be realized. This allowance primarily relates to the deferred
tax assets established for net operating loss carryforwards. Any
reductions in the allowance resulting from the realization of
the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will result in a
reduction of goodwill. In 2007, the Company recorded a net
reduction in goodwill of $16million related to the
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.   As disclosed in Note1, the Company adopted FIN48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on
January1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of
FIN48, the company recognized a $47million increase
in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits,
including interest and penalties of $24million, a
decrease of $12million in goodwill related to a previous
business combination, and a $59million charge to the
January1, 2007, opening balance of retained earnings.   After recognizing the impacts of adopting FIN48, as of the
adoption date, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits
of $249million of which $236million, if
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.   Under FIN48, the Company has elected to continue its prior
practice of accounting for interest and penalties on uncertain
tax positions as income tax. As a result, the Company has
reported $30million in the aggregate related to interest
and penalty exposure as accrued income tax expense in the
balance sheet as of December31, 2007 and during 2007, the
Company recognized $15million of interest and penalties
in the income statement.   The most significant tax jurisdiction for the Company is the
United States. The Company files income tax returns in various
state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple
legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open
tax years subject to tax audit on average of between 3to
6years in these jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue
Service IRS, is currently examining the Companys
U.S.income tax returns for
1999-2005.
The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of
limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and
accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods.
Tax years in certain state and foreign jurisdictions remain
subject to examination; however the uncertain tax positions
related to these jurisdictions are not considered material. In
addition to the IRS audit, the Company is also pursuing treaty
clearance related to interest deductibility outside of the
U.S.which, if received, could have a material impact on
the tax expense during 2008. Unrecognized tax benefits in total
related to the IRS audit and treaty clearances is
$178million at December31, 2007. There can be no
assurance that any portion of this will be favorably resolved.   During 2007, the Company added $19million of tax,
interest and penalties related to 2007 activity for identified
uncertain tax positions and reversed $39million of tax
and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of
prior uncertain positions.

the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS158 as
of December31, 2006.   The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
Companys funding policy with respect to its defined
benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
of U.S.federal and local foreign laws. AMETEK estimates
that it will make cash contributions of approximately
$5million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans
in 2008.   The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 its fiscal
year-end for its U.S.defined benefit pension plans and an
October 1 measurement date for its foreign defined benefit
pension plans. Effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008, SFAS158 requires the measurement
date to be the Companys fiscal year-end for all defined
benefit plans.   The Company sponsors a 401k retirement and savings plan for
eligible U.S.employees. Participants in the savings plan
may contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a
dollar-for-dollar basis up to 6% of eligible compensation or a
maximum of $1,200 per participant.   The Companys retirement and savings plan has a defined
contribution retirement feature principally to cover
U.S.salaried employees joining the Company after
December31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
pre-established percentage of the covered employees salary
subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the
Companys foreign operations participate in various local
defined contribution plans.   The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
certain of its U.S.acquired businesses for the benefit of
eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of
the participants base compensation.   The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
arrangements
and/or a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP covering certain
current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental
benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement
benefits that would have been provided under the Companys
primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on
compensation that must be taken into account under those plans.
The projected benefit obligations of the SERP and the contracts
will primarily be funded

Amounts in 2007 and 2006 include an approximate 10% investment
in alternative assets consisting of hedge funds. Amounts in 2007
and 2006 also include cash and cash equivalents.   The fair value of plan assets for U.S.plans was
$4183million and $3963million at December31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
return on these plan assets was 825% in 2007 and 2006. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, equity securities included
679,200shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market
value of $318million 76% of total plan investment
assets at December31, 2007 and a market value of
$216million 55% of total plan investment assets at
December31, 2006.   The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S.defined benefit
plans investment strategy are to maximize the plans
funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
established. Since there may be periods of time where both
equity and fixed-income markets provide poor returns, an
allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
overall portfolios diversification and return potential.
The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking
into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary.   The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
component.   The objective of the fixed-income portion of the pension assets
is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
interest rate fluctuations.   Other than for investments in alternative assets, described in
note aabove, certain investments are prohibited.
Prohibited investments include venture capital, private
placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading,
commodities, limited partnerships, short selling, and rights and
warrants. Foreign currency futures, options, and forward
contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

Primarily cash, cash equivalents and insurance contracts.   The objective of AMETEK, Inc.s foreign defined benefit
plans investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
different asset classes, relative to the plans liabilities
and how this can be affected by diversification, and the
relative returns available on equities, fixed-income
investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility
of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are
considered. It is expected that equities will outperform
fixed-income investments over the long term. However, the
trustees recognize the fact that fixed-income investments may
better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the
relatively young active employee group covered by the plans, and
the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to
adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward
equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be
reviewed from time to time in view of changes in market
conditions and in the plans liability profile.   The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
assets. This review also considered current capital market
conditions and expectations of projected future investment
returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
The current low interest rate environment also influences this
outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S.and
foreign plans remains at 825% and 700%, respectively, for 2008.   At the end of 2007 and 2006, the projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets

Segment and Geographic Information   Descriptive
Information about Reportable Segments   The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and EMG. The
Company manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments
for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
type, production processes, distribution methods, and management
organizations.   EIG produces instrumentation for various electronic applications
used in transportation industries, including aircraft cockpit
instruments and displays, airborne electronics systems that
monitor and record flight and engine data, and pressure,
temperature, flow and liquid-level sensors for commercial
airlines and aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. EIG also
produces analytical instrumentation for the laboratory and
research markets, as well as instruments for food service
equipment, measurement and monitoring instrumentation for
various process industries and instruments and complete
instrument panels for heavy trucks and heavy construction and
agricultural vehicles. EIG also manufactures ultraprecise
measurement instrumentation, as well as thermoplastic compounds
for automotive, appliance, and telecommunications applications.   EMG produces brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
applications. EMG also produces high-purity metal powders and
alloys in powder, strip, and wire form for electronic
components, aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat
exchangers and thermal management subsystems. EMG also supplies
hermetically sealed moisture-proof connectors, terminals and
headers. These electromechanical devices are used in aerospace,
defense and other industrial applications. Additionally, EMG
produces air-moving electric motors and motor-blower systems for
manufacturers of floor care appliances and outdoor power
equipment. Sales of floor care and specialty motors represented
137% in 2007, 156% in 2006 and 192% in 2005 of the
Companys consolidated net sales.   Measurement
of Segment Results   Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
and expenses including certain administrative and other
expenses applicable to each segment, but does not include an
allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and
profits, which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are
generally based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment
assets include allocations directly related to the
segments operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of
investments, prepaid pensions, insurance deposits, and deferred
taxes.

Guarantees   The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
enhance the subsidiarys stand-alone creditworthiness. The
amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
point in time. The maximum amount of future payment obligations
relative to these various guarantees was approximately
$1081million, and the outstanding liability under certain

retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee
liabilities whose terms range in duration and often are not
explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such
indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount
of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically
stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims
against them in connection with their positions with the
Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims
related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the
Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any,
under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a
material impact on its results of operations, financial
position, or cash flows.   Product
Warranties   The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the
most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience,
and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
expenses.   Changes in the Companys accrued product warranty
obligation for 2007 and 2006 were as follows in thousands

Contingencies   Asbestos
Litigation   The Company including its subsidiaries has been named as a
defendant, along with many other companies, in a number of
asbestos-related lawsuits. Many of these lawsuits either relate
to businesses which were acquired by the Company and do not
involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company,
or relate to previously owned businesses of the Company which
are under new ownership. In connection with many of these
lawsuits, the sellers or new owners of such businesses, as the
case may be, have agreed to indemnify the Company against these
claims the Indemnified Claims. The Indemnified
Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such
sellers and new owners. These sellers and new owners have met
their obligations in all respects, and the Company does not have
any reason to believe such parties would fail to fulfill their
obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been
rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related
lawsuit. The Company believes it has strong defenses to the
claims being asserted, and intends to continue to vigorously
defend itself in these matters.   Environmental
Matters   Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
waste products were handled in

STATEMENTSContinued   compliance with regulations existing at that time, at
December31, 2007 the Company is named a Potentially
Responsible Party PRP at 15
non-AMETEK-owned
former waste disposal or treatment sites the
non-owned sites. The Company is identified as a
de minimis party in 12 of these sites based on the
low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the
amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these sites,
the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the
de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting
executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement
amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites, the Company
is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume
attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily
responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an
appropriate settlement amount. In the three remaining sites
where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is
participating in the investigation
and/or
related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves
have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys
expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these
issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects
this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites,
the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for
probable remediation activities at certain of its current or
previously owned manufacturing locations the owned
sites. For claims and proceedings against the Company with
respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established
once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and
estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through
the various stages of investigation, risk assessment,
feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain
instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for
such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of
the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of
remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current
estimates, and the amounts accrued in the financial statements;
however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to
result in a material change to the financial statements. In
estimating our liability for remediation, we also consider our
likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation
expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their
obligations.   Total environmental reserves at December31, 2007 and 2006
were $253million and $287million, respectively for
non-owned and owned sites. In 2007, the Company provided
$15million of additional reserves for environmental
liabilities. The Companys reserves for environmental
liabilities at December31, 2007 and 2006 include reserves
of $180million and $212million, respectively, for
an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005
acquisition of HCC Industries HCC. The Company is
solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one
of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in
the SanGabriel Valley of California. The Company has
obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from
the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required
remedial activities. At December31, 2007, the Company has
$126million in receivables related to HCC for probable
recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed
third-party funds to support the required remediation. In
addition, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners
for up to $190million of additional costs.   The Company also has agreements with other former owners of
certain of its acquired businesses as well as new owners of
previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements,
the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to
indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other
liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of
these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some
environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their
obligations in all material respects; however, one of these
companies recently filed for bankruptcy liquidation. AMETEK has
established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known
responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The
Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would
fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion
of management, based upon presently available information and
past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision
for probable costs has been made, and the ultimate cost
resulting from these actions is not expected to materially
affect the consolidated financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows of the Company.

Controls
and Procedures   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information, which is required to be disclosed, is accumulated
and communicated to management in a timely manner. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness
of our system of disclosure controls and procedures as required
by Exchange Act
Rule13a-15b
as of December31, 2007. Based on that evaluation, the
Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the
reasonable assurance level.   Such evaluation did not identify any change in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting during
the year ended December31, 2007 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.   Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   Managements report on the Companys internal controls
over financial reporting is included on page36. The report
of the independent registered public accounting firm with
respect to the effectiveness of internal control over financial
