We also have audited UNFIs internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. UNFIs management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of United Natural Foods, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July 30, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, United Natural Foods, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.On March 31, 2016 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nor-Cal Produce, Inc. Nor-Cal, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of July 30, 2016, Nor-Cals internal control over financial reporting with associated assets of approximately $686 million of which $300 million represents customer lists and $15 million represents a tradename and intangible assets included within the scope of the assessment and total revenue of $514 million generated by Nor-Cal that was included in the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended July 30, 2016.

The Company sells its products primarily throughout the United States and Canada.bBasis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.The fiscal year of the Company ends on the Saturday closest to July31. Fiscal 2016, 2015and 2014ended on July30, 2016, August1, 2015and August2, 2014, respectively. Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 contained 52weeks. Each of the Company interim quarters consisted of 13weeks.Net sales consist primarily of sales of natural, organic and specialty products to retailers, adjusted for customer volume discounts, returns and allowances. Net sales also include amounts charged by the Company to customers for shipping and handling, and fuel surcharges. The principal components of cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold, plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to the Company distribution centers, offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase of the suppliers' products. Cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by the Company manufacturing subsidiary, Woodstock Farms Manufacturing, for inbound transportation costs and depreciation for manufacturing equipment, offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers' products. Operating expenses include salaries and wages, employee benefits, warehousing and delivery, selling, occupancy, insurance, administrative, share-based compensation and amortization expense. Operating expenses also include depreciation expense related to the wholesale and retail divisions. Other expense income includes interest on outstanding indebtedness, interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses. Certain items in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 1, 2015 have been reclassified as a result of an immaterial correction explained in Note 15, Immaterial Correction of Prior Period Financial Statements. These revisions were not material to the Company consolidated financial statements as a whole.cCash EquivalentsCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of threemonths or less.dInventories and Cost of SalesInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Allowances received from suppliers are recorded as reductions in cost of sales upon the sale of the related products.eProperty and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment under capital leases is stated at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease or the fair value of the asset. Property and equipment includes the non-cash expenditures made by the landlord for the Aurora, Colorado distribution center in addition to office space utilized as the Company Corporate headquarters in Providence, Rhode Island as the lease qualifies for capital lease treatment pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 840, Leases. Property and equipment also includes accumulated depreciation with respect to these items. Refer to Note 8, Long-Term Debt, for additional information. Applicable interest charges incurred during the construction of new facilities may be capitalized as one of the elements of cost and are amortized over the assets' estimated useful lives. The Company capitalized $04 millionof interest during the fiscal year ended July30, 2016related to the construction of a new distribution center in Gilroy, California which began operations in February 2016. The Company capitalized $05 millionof interest during the fiscal year ended August1, 2015related to the construction of new distribution centers in Prescott, Wisconsin and Gilroy, California.

Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The calculation of the Company tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations and is based on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return,gLong-Lived AssetsManagement reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured based on a fair value discounted cash flow model.hGoodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following lives:Customer  agreements1-10 yearsTrademarks and tradenames4-10yearsGoodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. The Company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually, and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year51Table of ContentsThe Company reporting units are at or one level below the operating segment level. Approximately 951%of the Company goodwill is within its wholesale reporting unit as of July 30, 2016. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Goodwill for ImpairmentASU 2011-08, the Company is allowed to perform a qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment unless it believes it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than the carrying value. The thresholds used by the Company for this determination in fiscal 2016were for any reporting units that 1have passed their previous two-step test with a margin of calculated fair value versus carrying value of at least 20%, 2have had a two-step test within the past five years, 3 have had no significant changes to their working capital structure, 4have current year income which is at least 85%of prior year amounts, and 5 present no other factors to be considered as outlined in ASU 2011-08. Based on the qualitative assessment performed for fiscal 2016, three of the Company four reporting units met these thresholds. As these reporting units have passed their previous two-step tests within the past 5 years, the reporting units' net income has not decreased more than 15%and their working capital requirements have not increased significantly, no quantitative testing was performed on these reporting units as part of the annual test in fiscal 2016. For the reporting unit that did not meet the thresholds above for fiscal 2016, the Company performed a two-step goodwill impairment analysis. The first step to identify potential impairment involves comparing the reporting unit estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. The reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis which is the basis for the fair value analysis. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further testing is required. This was the case for the reporting unit that required a quantitative test for the annual assessment in fiscal 2016. Had the carrying value exceeded estimated fair value for this unit, there would have been an indication of potential impairment and the second step would have been performed to measure the amount of impairment. If required, the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination, by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identifiable intangible assets. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Impairment is measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. In accordance with ASU No. 2012-02, Intangibles- Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, the Company is allowed to perform a qualitative assessment for intangible asset impairment unless it believes it is more likely than not that an intangible asset fair value is less than the carrying value. The thresholds used by the Company for this determination in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016were for any intangible assets or groups of assets that 1have passed their previous two-step test with a margin of calculated fair value versus carrying value of at least 20%, 2have had performed a two-step test within the past five years, and 3 have current year income which is at least 85%of prior year amounts. The Company only indefinite lived intangible assets are the branded product line asset group. During fiscal 2016, the Company annual qualitative assessment of its indefinite lived intangible assets indicated that no impairment existed.During fiscal 2015, the Company ceased operations at its Canadian facility located in Scotstown, Quebec which was acquired in 2010. In connection with this closure, the Company recognized an impairment of $06 millionduring the first quarter of fiscal 2015 representing the remaining unamortized value of an intangible asset. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill and the amount allocated by reportable segment for the years presented are as follows in  as of August 2,  adjustment for prior year business  in foreign exchange rates4,4214,421Goodwill as of August 2,  from current year business  in foreign exchange rates9292Goodwill as of July 30,  of ContentsThe following table presents the detail of the Company other intangible assets in thousands:July 30, 2016August 1, 2015Gross   intangible assets:Customer   and tradenames1,7001151,585Total amortizing intangible  lived intangible assets:Trademarks and  expense was $89 million, $78 millionand $51 millionfor the fiscal years ended July30, 2016, August1, 2015and August2, 2014, respectively. The estimated future amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter on definite lived intangible assets existing as of July30, 2016is shown below:Fiscal Year:In  and  Recognition and Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company records revenue upon delivery of products. Revenues are recorded net of applicable sales discounts and estimated sales returns. Sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for as reductions in revenue as the related revenue is recorded. The Company sales are primarily to customers located throughout the United States and Canada.Whole Foods Market, Inc. was the Company largest customer in each fiscal year presented. Whole Foods Market, Inc. accounted for approximately 35%and 34%of the Company net sales for the fiscal years ended July30, 2016and August1, 2015, respectively, and 36%of the Company net sales for the fiscal year ended August2, 2014. There were no other customers that individually generated 10%or more of the Company net sales during those periods.The Company analyzes customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history, payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash-on-delivery terms, or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received, orders are released; a failure to pay results in held or canceled orders.jFair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. Refer to Note9, Fair Value Measurements, for additional information regarding the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of notes payable and long-term debt are based on the instruments' interest rate, terms, maturity date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Company incremental borrowing rate for similar financial instruments. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange53Table of ContentsJuly 30, 2016August 1, 2015Carrying ValueFair ValueCarrying ValueFair ValueIn thousandsAssets:Cash and cash      debt, including current  of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based on amounts that differ from those estimates.lNotes Receivable, TradeThe Company issues trade notes receivable to certain customers under twobasic circumstances; inventory purchases for initial store openings and overdue accounts receivable. Notes issued in connection with store openings are generally receivable over a period not to exceed thirty-six months. Notes issued in connection with overdue accounts receivable may extend for periods greater than oneyear. All notes are issued at a market interest rate and contain certain guarantees and collateral assignments in favor of the Company.mShare-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for its share-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC 718, Stock CompensationASC718. ASC718 requires the recognition of the fair value of share-based compensation in net income. The Company has fourshare-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note3. Share-based compensation consists of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units. Stock options are granted to employees and directors at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company stock at the dates of grant. Generally, stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted to employees vest ratably over 4 yearsfrom the grant date and grants to members of the Company Board of Directors vest ratably over 6 monthswith one half vesting immediately. The Company President and Chief Executive Officer and its other executive officers or members of senior management have been granted performance units which have vested, when and if earned, in accordance with the terms of the related performance unit award agreements. During fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015and fiscal 2014, the Company granted performance-based stock units to its executive officers that will vest if the Company achieves certain performance metrics as of and for the years ended July29, 2017, July30, 2016and August1, 2015, respectively. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which generally equals the vesting period.ASC 718 also requires that compensation expense be recognized for only the portion of share-based awards that are expected to vest. Therefore, we apply estimated forfeiture rates that are derived from historical employee and director termination activity to reduce the amount of compensation expense recognized. If the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods.The Company receives an income tax deduction for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units when they vest and for non-qualified stock options exercised by employees equal to the excess of the fair market value of its common stock on the vesting or exercise date over the exercised price. Excess tax benefits tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized and tax deficit tax deficit resulting from compensation cost recognized in excess of tax deductions are presented as a cash inflow or outflow provided by financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows. 54Table of ContentsnEarnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adding the dilutive potential common shares to the weighted average number of common shares that were outstanding during the period. For purposes of the diluted earnings per share calculation, outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based awards, if applicable, are considered common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock method. A reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of the basic and diluted earnings per share for all periods presented follows:Fiscal year endedJuly30, 2016August1, 2015August2, 2014In thousandsBasic weighted average shares  effect of dilutive common stock equivalents based upon the treasury stock method86246286Diluted weighted average shares  anti-dilutive share-based payment awards excluded from the computation above8476oComprehensive Income LossComprehensive income loss is reported in accordance with ASU No. 2013-02, and includes net income and the change in other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss is comprised of the net change in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, as well as foreign currency translation related to the translation of UNFI Canada, Inc. UNFI Canada from the functional currency of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollar reporting currency. For all periods presented, the Company displays comprehensive income loss and its components in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.pDerivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company is exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates, fuel costs, and with the operation of UNFI Canada, foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses derivatives principally in the management of interest rate and fuel price exposure. From time to time the Company may use contracts to hedge transactions in foreign currency. The Company does not utilize derivatives that contain leverage features. For derivative transactions accounted for as hedges, on the date the Company enters into the derivative transaction, the exposure is identified. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the Company specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the risks related to the hedged item. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis as needed. qShipping and Handling Fees and CostsThe Company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound freight are generally recorded in cost of sales, whereas shipping and handling costs for selecting, quality assurance, and outbound transportation are recorded in operating expenses. Outbound shipping and handling costs totaled $4675 million, $4529 millionand $3977 millionfor the fiscal years ended July30, 2016, August1, 2015and August2, 2014, respectively. rReserves for Self-InsuranceThe Company is primarily self-insured for workers' compensation and general and automobile liability insurance. It is the Company policy to record the self-insured portion of workers' compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods to estimate the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled, and that have been incurred but not yet reported. Any projection of losses concerning workers' compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns55Table of ContentssOperating Lease ExpensesThe Company records lease expense via the straight-line method. For leases with step rent provisions whereby the rental payments increase over the life of the lease, and for leases where the Company receives rent-free periods, the Company recognizes expense based on a straight-line basis based on the total minimum lease payments to be made over the expected lease term.tRecently Issued Accounting PronouncementsIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation Topic 718: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB simplification initiative. This ASU will change aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions including accounting for income taxes, the classification of excess tax benefits and the classification of employee taxes paid when shares are withheld for tax-withholding purposes on the statement of cash flows, forfeitures, and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. The ASU is effective for public companies with interim and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company will be the first quarter of the fiscal year ending August 3, 2019. Early adoption is permitted provided that the entire ASU is adopted. The Company has not yet adopted this standard, but if the Company had adopted this standard in fiscal 2016, the result would have been a reclassification from additional paid-in capital to income tax expense. For fiscal 2016, the result would have increased current year income tax expense by $01 millionand for fiscal 2015, the result would have decreased current year income tax expense by $27 million.In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, Leases Topic 842, which will require companies as the lessee to recognize lease assets and liabilities for leases formerly classified as operating leases. The ASU is effective for public companies with interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, which for the Company will be the first quarter of the fiscal year ending August 1, 2020. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on the Company consolidated financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-1, Financial Instruments - Overall Subtopic 825-10: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities, which will change the income statement impact of equity investments, and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected.

Early adoption at the beginning of an interim or annual period is permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this standard, but if the Company had adopted this standard in fiscal 2016, the result would have been a reclassification from current deferred income tax assets to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of $352 millionand $323 millionas of July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015, respectively.In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606: Deferral of the Effective Datedeferring the adoption of previously issued guidance published in May 2014, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Topic 606. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new pronouncement is effective for public companies with annual periods, and interim periods within those periods, beginning after December 15, 2017, which for the Company will be the first quarter of the fiscal year ending August 3, 2019.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of InterestSubtopic 835-30ASU 2015-03, which simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of $16 millionand $18 millionas of July 30, 2016 and August 1, 2015, respectively, from other long-term assets to long-term debt on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. 56Table of ContentsuCorrection of Prior Period ErrorsDuring the three months ended January 31, 2015, the Company recorded a cumulative adjustment to net sales for $77 millionrelated to amounts owed to a customer resulting from an incorrect calculation of contractual obligations to that customer from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2014. The aggregate amount of the reduction in net sales related to this incorrect calculation in fiscal 2015 was $93 million, including a $16 millionreduction in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. The Company reviewed the impact of these corrections in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 Materiality, and determined that these corrections were not material to prior periods or the periods in which the amounts were recorded. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company revised previously reported amounts for identified errors in accounting for early payment discounts on inventory purchases. Management considered both the quantitative and qualitative factors within the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting BulletinNo99, Materiality, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. Based on evaluation of the errors, management has concluded that the prior period errors were immaterial to the previously issued consolidated financial statements.

Black-Scholes utilizes assumptions related to volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the dividend yield and expected life. Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on the historical volatility of the Company stock price. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The model incorporates exercise and post-vesting forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected term is derived from historical information and other factors. The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance share units are determined based on the number of shares or units, as applicable, granted and the quoted price of the Company common stock as of the grant date.The following summary presents the weighted average assumptions used for stock options granted in fiscal 2016, 2015and 2014:60Table of ContentsFiscal year endedJuly30, 2016August1, 2015August2, 2014Expected  yield Risk free interest rate13%14%12%Expected term in years404030The Company has fourequity incentive plans that provide for the issuance of stock options: the 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996 Plan, the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan, the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended the 2004 Plan, and the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated the 2012 Plan collectively, the Plans.

Proceeds from this Term Loan Agreement were used to pay down borrowings on the Company amended and restated revolving credit facility.On April29, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment Agreement the Term Loan Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement which amends the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Amendment was entered into to reflect the changes to the amended and restated revolving credit facility reflected in the Amendment. The Term Loan Agreement will terminate on the earlier of a August 14, 2022 and b the date that is ninety days prior to the termination date of the Companys amended and restated revolving credit agreement. Under the Term Loan Agreement, the borrowers at their option may request the establishment of one or more new term loan commitments in increments of at least $100 million, but not to exceed $500 millionin total, subject to the approval of the lenders electing to participate in such incremental loans and the satisfaction of the conditions required by the Term Loan Agreement. The borrowers will be required to make quarterly principal payments on these incremental borrowings in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan Agreement. On September 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amendment Agreement the Second Amendment to the Term Loan Agreement which amends the Term Loan Agreement. The Second Amendment was entered into to adjust the applicable margin charged to borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement. As amended by the Second Amendment, borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at rates that, at the Company option, can be either: 1 a base rate generally defined as the sum of i the highest of x the administrative agent prime rate, y the average overnight federal funds effective rateplus 050%and z one-month LIBORplus one percent 1% per annum and ii a margin of 075%; or, 2 a LIBOR rate generally defined as the sum of i LIBOR as published by Reuters or other commercially available sources for one, two, three or six months or, if approved by all affected lenders, nine monthsall as selected by the Company, and ii a margin of 175%. Interest accrued on borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement is payable in arrears. Interest accrued on any LIBOR loan is payable on the last day of the interest period applicable to the loan and, with respect to any LIBOR loan of more than three 3 months, on the last day of every three 3 months of such interest period. Interest accrued on base rate loans is payable on the first day of every month. The Company is also required to pay certain customary fees to the administrative agent. The borrowers' obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by certain parcels of the borrowers' real property. The Term Loan Agreement includes financial covenants that require i the ratio of the Companys consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Term Loan Agreement minus the unfinanced portion of Capital Expenditures as defined in the Term Loan Agreement to the Companys consolidated Fixed Charges as defined in the Term Loan Agreement to be at least 120 to 100 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters, ii the ratio of the Companys Consolidated Funded Debt as defined in the Term Loan Agreement to the Companys EBITDA for the four fiscal quarters most recently ended to be not more than 300 to 100 as of the end of any fiscal quarter and iii the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the Companys outstanding principal balance under the Loans as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, divided by the Mortgaged Property Value as defined in the Term Loan Agreement to be not more than 75% at any time65Table of ContentsDuring the fiscal year ended August 1, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to an existing lease agreement for the office space utilized as the Company corporate headquarters in Providence, Rhode Island. The amendment provides for additional office space to be utilized by the Company and extends the lease term for an additional 10 years. The lease qualifies for capital lease treatment pursuant to ASC 840, Leases,and the estimated fair value of the building is recorded on the balance sheet with the capital lease obligation included in long-term debt. A portion of each lease payment reduces the amount of the lease obligation, and a portion is recorded as interest expense at an effective rate of approximately 1238%.During the fiscal year ended July 28, 2012, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a new distribution facility in Aurora, Colorado. As of the fiscal year ended August3, 2013, actual construction costs exceeded the construction allowance as defined by the lease agreement, and therefore, the Company determined it met the criteria for continuing involvement pursuant to ASC 840, Leases, and applied the financing method to account for this transaction. Under the financing method, the book value of the distribution facility and related accumulated depreciation remains on the balance sheet. The construction allowance is recorded as a financing obligation in long-term debt. A portion of each lease payment will reduce the amount of the financing obligation, and a portion will be recorded as interest expense at an effective rate of approximately 732%. As of July30, 2016and August1, 2015, the Company long-term debt consisted of the following:July30, 2016August1, 2015In thousandsFinancing obligation, due monthly, and maturing in October 2028 at an effective interest rate of 732%$31,502$32,510Capital lease, Providence, Rhode Island corporate headquarters, due monthly, and maturing in April 2025 at an effective interest rate of 1238%13,64313,883Real-estate backed Term Loan Agreement, due quarterly  current  debt, excluding current  Real-estate backed Term Loan Agreement balance is shown net of debt issuance costs of $16 millionand $18 millionas of July30, 2016and August1, 2015, respectively, due to the Company adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Aggregate maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter are as follows at July30, 2016:YearIn  and  VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe Company utilizes ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC820, for financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on at least an annual basis. ASC820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:Level1 InputsUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities66Table of ContentsLevel2 InputsInputs other than quoted prices included in Level1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data.Level3 InputsOne or more significant inputs that are unobservable and supported by little or no market activity, and that reflect the use of significant management judgment. Level3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, and significant management judgment or estimation.Interest Rate Swap AgreementsOn January23, 2015, the Company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of August 3, 2015. The agreement provides for the Company to pay interest for a seven-year period at a fixed rate of 1795%on an initial amortizing principal amount of $1400 millionwhile receiving interest for the same period at the one-month LIBOR on the same notional amount. The interest rate swap has been entered into as a hedge against LIBOR movements on the current variable rate related to the Companys real-estate backed Term Loan Agreement entered into on August 14, 2014, explained in more detail in Note 8 Long-Term Debt, to protect against rising interest rates. We expect that the interest rate swap will effectively fix the Companys interest rate payments on the $1400 millionof debt under the Company Term Loan Agreement. The swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815. On June 7, 2016, the Company entered into two pay fixed and receive float interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying variable rate debt on the Companys amended and restated revolving credit facility. The first agreement has an effective date of June 9, 2016 and expires in June of 2019. This interest rate swap agreement has a notional principal amount of $500 millionand provides for the Company to pay interest for a three-year period at a fixed annual rate of 08725%while receiving interest for the same period at one-month LIBOR on the same notional principal amount. This swap, in conjunction with the amended and restated revolving credit facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on the $500 millionnotional amount. The second agreement has an effective date of June 9, 2016 and expires concurrent with the scheduled maturity of our amended and restated revolving credit facility in April of 2021. This interest rate swap agreement has a notional principal amount of $250 millionand provides for the Company to pay interest for a five-year period at a fixed rate of 1065%while receiving interest for the same period at one-month LIBOR on the same notional principal amount. This swap, in conjunction with the amended and restated revolving credit facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on the $250 millionnotional amount. On June 24, 2016, the Company entered into two additional pay fixed and receive float interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying variable rate debt on the Companys amended and restated revolving credit facility. The first agreement has an effective date of June 24, 2016 and expires in June of 2019. This interest rate swap agreement has a notional principal amount of $500 millionand provides for the Company to pay interest for a three-year period at a fixed annual rate of 07265%while receiving interest for the same period at one-month LIBOR on the same notional principal amount. This swap, in conjunction with the amended and restated revolving credit facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on the $500 millionnotional amount. The second agreement has an effective date of June 24, 2016 and expires concurrent with the scheduled maturity of our amended and restated revolving credit facility in April of 2021. This interest rate swap agreement has a notional principal amount of $250 millionand provides for the Company to pay interest for a five-year period at a fixed rate of 09260%while receiving interest for the same period at one-month LIBOR on the same notional principal amount. This swap, in conjunction with the amended and restated revolving credit facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on the $250 millionnotional amount. Interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Companys interest rate swap agreements are designated as a cash flow hedges at July30, 2016and are reflected at their fair value of $59 millionin the consolidated balance sheet. The Company uses the Hypothetical Derivative Method described in ASC 815 for quarterly prospective and retrospective assessments of hedge effectiveness, as well as for measurements of hedge ineffectiveness. Under this method, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged transactions. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings in interest income when the hedged transactions affect earnings. Ineffectiveness resulting from the hedge is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income as part of other income. The Company did not have any material hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the fiscal year ended July30, 2016. The Company also monitors the risk of counterparty default on an ongoing basis and noted that the counterparties are reputable financial institutions. Fuel Supply Agreements67Table of ContentsFrom time to time the Company is a party to fixed price fuel supply agreements. During the fiscal years ended July30, 2016and August1, 2015, the Company entered into several agreements which required it to purchase a portion of its diesel fuel each month at fixed prices through December 2016. These fixed price fuel agreements qualify for the normal purchase exception under ASC 815; therefore, the fuel purchases under these contracts are expensed as incurred and included within operating expenses.Financial InstrumentsThe following table provides the fair value hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of July30, 2016and August 1, 2015:Fair Value at July 30, 2016Fair Value at August 1, 2015InthousandsLevel 1Level 2Level 3Level 1Level 2Level 3Liabilities:Interest Rate Swap$5,917$726The fair value of the Company other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses are derived using Level2 inputs and approximate carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of notes payable approximate carrying amounts as they are variable rate instruments. The carrying amount of notes payable approximates fair value as interest rates on the credit facility approximates current market rates level 2 criteria.The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies taking into account the instruments' interest rate, terms, maturity date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Company incremental borrowing rate for similar financial instruments and are therefore deemed Level2 inputs. However, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange.July30, 2016August1, 2015InthousandsCarrying ValueFair ValueCarrying ValueFair ValueLiabilitiesLong term debt, including current  AND CONTINGENCIESThe Company leases various facilities and equipment under operating lease agreements with varying terms. Most of the leases contain renewal options and purchase options at several specific dates throughout the terms of the leases.Rent and other lease expense for the fiscal years ended July30, 2016, August1, 2015and August2, 2014totaled approximately $654 million, $748 millionand $651 million, respectively.Future minimum annual fixed payments required under non-cancelable operating leases having an original term of more than one year as of July30, 2016are as follows:Fiscal YearIn  and thereafter55,364$264,632As of July30, 2016, outstanding commitments for the purchase of inventory were approximately $189 million. The Company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $374 millionat July30, 2016.As of July30, 2016, outstanding commitments for the purchase of diesel fuel were approximately $26 million68Table of ContentsThe Company may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, amounts accrued, as well as the total amount of reasonably possible losses with respect to such matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not deemed to be material to the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. Legal expenses incurred in connection with claims and legal actions are expensed as incurred11.RETIREMENT PLANSRetirement PlanThe Company has a defined contribution retirement plan under Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code, the United Natural Foods,Inc. Retirement Plan the Retirement Plan. In order to become a participant in the Retirement Plan, employees must meet certain eligibility requirements as described in the Retirement Plan document. In addition to amounts contributed to the Retirement Plan by employees, the Company makes contributions to the Retirement Plan on behalf of the employees. The Company also has the Millbrook Distribution Services Union Retirement Plan, which was assumed as part of an acquisition during fiscal 2008 and the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund, which was assumed as part of the Nor-Cal acquisition in March 2016. The Company contributions to these plans were approximately $73 million, $64 million, and $58 millionfor the fiscal years ended July30, 2016, August1, 2015and August2, 2014, respectively.Deferred Compensation and Supplemental Retirement PlansThe Company non-employee directors and certain of its employees are eligible to participate in the United Natural Foods Deferred Compensation Plan and the United Natural Foods Deferred Stock Plan collectively the Deferral Plans. The Deferral Plans are nonqualified deferred compensation plans which are administered by the Company Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Deferral Plans were established to provide participants with the opportunity to defer the receipt of all or a portion of their compensation to a non-qualified retirement plan in amounts greater than the amount permitted to be deferred under the Company 401k Plan. The Company believes that this is an appropriate benefit because iit operates to place employees and non-employee directors in the same position as other employees who are not affected by Internal Revenue Code limits placed on plans such as the Company 401k Plan; iidoes not substantially increase the Company financial obligations to its employees and directors there are no employer matching contributions, only a crediting of deemed earnings; and iiiprovides additional incentives to the Company employees and directors, since amounts set aside by the employees and directors are subject to the claims of the Company creditors until paid. Under the Deferral Plans, only the payment of the compensation earned by the participant is deferred and there is no deferral of the expense in the Company financial statements related to the participants' earnings; the Company records the related compensation expense in the year in which the compensation is earned by the participants.Under the Deferred Stock Plan, which was frozen to new deferrals effective January1, 2007, each eligible participant could elect to defer between 0%and 100%of restricted stock awards granted during the election calendar year. Effective January1, 2007, each participant may elect to defer up to 100%of their restricted share unit awards, performance shares and performance units under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, each participant may also elect to defer a minimum of $1,000and a maximum of 90%of base salary and 100%of director fees, employee bonuses and commissions, as applicable, earned by the participants for the calendar year. Participants' cash-derived deferrals accrue earnings and appreciation based on the performance of mutual funds selected by the participant. The value of equity-based awards deferred under the Deferred Compensation and Deferred Stock Plans are based upon the performance of the Company common stock.The Millbrook Deferred Compensation Plan and the Millbrook Supplemental Retirement Plan were assumed by the Company as part of an acquisition during fiscal 2008. Deferred compensation relates to a compensation arrangement implemented in 1984 by a predecessor of the acquired company in the form of a non-qualified defined benefit plan and a supplemental retirement plan which permitted former officers and certain management employees, at the time, to defer portions of their compensation to earn specified maximum benefits upon retirement. The future obligations, which are fixed in accordance with the plans, have been recorded at a discount rate of 57%. These plans do not allow new participants, and there are no active employees subject to these plans.In an effort to provide for the benefits associated with these plans, the acquired company predecessor purchased whole-life insurance contracts on the plan participants. The cash surrender value of these policies included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet was $122 millionand $115 millionat July30, 2016and August1, 2015, respectively. At July30, 2016, total future obligations including interest, assuming commencement of payments at an individual retirement age, as defined under the deferred compensation arrangement, were as follows:69Table of ContentsFiscal YearIn  and  STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANThe Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership Plan the ESOP for the purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the Company for the benefit of eligible employees. The ESOP was effective as of November1, 1988 and received notice of qualification by the Internal Revenue Service.In connection with the adoption of the ESOP, a Trust was established to hold the shares acquired. On November1, 1988, the Trust purchased 40%of the then outstanding common stock of the Company at a price of $41 million. The trustees funded this purchase by issuing promissory notes to the initial stockholders, with the Trust shares pledged as collateral. These notes bore interest at 133%and were payable through May 2015. As the debt was repaid, the shares were released from collateral and allocated to active employees, based on the proportion of principal and interest paid in the year. All shares held by the ESOP were purchased prior to December31, 1992, except that 9,393shares were purchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 to fund the final allocation of shares under the ESOP and during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company purchased an additional 324shares to correct a share shortage as the ESOP was merged with the Retirement Plan effective October 30, 2015. Prior to the final release of the shares in the ESOP, the Company considered unreleased shares of the ESOP to be outstanding for purposes of calculating both basic and diluted earnings per share, whether or not the shares had been committed to be released. Prior to the repayments, the debt of the ESOP was recorded as debt and the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the consolidated balance sheets. The debt was fully repaid as of August 1, 2015, and no contributions were made during fiscal 2016. During the fiscal year ended August1, 2015, contributions totaling approximately $01 millionwere made to the Trust, less than $01 millionof which represented interest.The ESOP shares were classified as follows:July30, 2016August1, 2015In thousandsTotal ESOP sharesbeginning of year1,0571,595Shares distributed to employees1,057538Total ESOP sharesend of year1,057Allocated shares1,057Unreleased sharesTotal ESOP shares1,057During the fiscal year ended August 1, 2015, 24,512shares were released for allocation based on note payments.

The Company considers relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes the Company financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. As of July30, 2016, the Company has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period and anticipates sufficient future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible. The Company also has the availability of future reversals of taxable temporary differences that are expected to generate taxable income in the future. Therefore, the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets for federal and state tax purposes appears more likely than not at July30, 2016and correspondingly no valuation allowance has been established.At July30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $30 millionfor federal income tax purposes. The federal carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately $03 millionunder Internal Revenue Code Section382. The carryforwards expire at various times between fiscal years 2017and 2027.The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various state jurisdictions. UNFI Canada files income tax returns in Canada and certain of its provinces. U.S. federal income tax examination years prior to 2013 have either statutorily or administratively been closed with the Internal Revenue Service, and with limited exception, the fiscal tax years that remain subject to examination by state jurisdictions range from the Company fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2015.The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. For the fiscal year ended July30, 2016, the net tax benefit realized in the consolidated statement of income was de minimis. For the fiscal year ended August1, 2015, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $05 millionin its consolidated statement of income. For the fiscal year ended August2, 2014, the Company recognized net tax benefits of $03 millionin its consolidated statement of income related to tax examinations closed during the fiscal year72Table of ContentsThe retained earnings of the Company non-U.S. subsidiaries that have not been subject to U.S. tax are $156 millionat July30, 2016. The Company considers these unremitted earnings to be indefinitely reinvested; therefore, we have not provided a deferred tax liability for any residual U.S. tax that may be due upon repatriation of these earnings. Because of the effect of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on these earnings in the event they no longer are indefinitely reinvested14.BUSINESS SEGMENTSThe Company has several operating divisions aggregated under the wholesale segment, which is the Company only reportable segment. These operating divisions have similar products and services, customer channels, distribution methods and historical margins. The wholesale segment is engaged in the national distribution of natural, organic and specialty foods, produce and related products in the United States and Canada. The Company has additional operating divisions that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reportable segments and are therefore aggregated under the caption of Other. Other includes a retail division, which engages in the sale of natural foods and related products to the general public through retail storefronts on the east coast of the United States, a manufacturing division, which engages in importing, roasting and packaging of nuts, seeds, dried fruit and snack items, and the Company branded product lines. Other also includes certain corporate operating expenses that are not allocated to operating divisions, which consist of depreciation, salaries, retainers, and other related expenses of officers, directors, corporate finance including professional services, information technology, governance, legal, human resources and internal audit that are necessary to operate the Company headquarters located in Providence, Rhode Island. As the Company continues to expand its business and serve its customers through a new national platform, these corporate expense amounts have increased, which is the primary driver behind the increasing operating losses within the Other category below. Non-operating expenses that are not allocated to the operating divisions are under the caption of Unallocated Expenses. The Company does not record its revenues for financial reporting purposes by product group, and it is therefore impracticable for the Company to report them accordingly73Table of ContentsFollowing is business segment information for the periods  thousandsFiscal year ended July30, 2016Net  and asset impairment  income  expense16,25916,259Interest income1,1151,115Other, net743743Income before income taxes208,222Depreciation and    year ended August1, 2015Net  and asset impairment expenses803803Operating income  expense14,49814,498Interest income356356Other, net1,9541,954Income before income taxes229,769Depreciation and    year ended August2, 2014Net  income  expense7,7537,753Interest income508508Other, net3,8653,865Income before income taxes207,408Depreciation and    CORRECTION TO PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTSDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company revised previously reported amounts for identified errors in accounting for early payment discounts on inventory purchases. Management considered both the quantitative and qualitative factors within the provisions of SEC Staff Accounting BulletinNo99, Materiality, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements. Based on evaluation 74Table of Contentsof the errors, management has concluded that the prior period errors were immaterial to the previously issued financial statements. As such, management has elected to correct the identified error in the prior periods. In doing so, balances in the consolidated financial statements included to which this footnote relates have been adjusted to reflect the correction in the proper periods.
