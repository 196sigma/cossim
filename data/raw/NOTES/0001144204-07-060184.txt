Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To
the
Board of Directors and
Shareholders
of Point360
Burbank,
California 
We
have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Point360 formerly
New
360 and subsidiary collectively, the Company as of June 30, 2007, December
31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income loss, invested equity, and cash
flows
for the
six months ended June 30, 2007 and for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility
of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provided a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In
our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Point360 and subsidiary
as
of June 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2007 and
each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION:
Point360s
Point360 or the Company business represents the assets and liabilities
used in managing and operating the business of Point360s predecessor Old
Point360 other than Old Point360s advertising distribution business. On
April 13, 2007, Old Point360.s Board of Directors approved a plan to
contribute such assets and liabilities to the Company, and to subsequently
distribute the common stock of the Company to Old Point360 shareholders on
a
share-for-share basis to form an independent, publicly traded entity. On April
16, 2007, Old Point360, the Company and DG FastChannel, Inc. DG FastChannel
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization and ancillary
documents the Agreements which establish the basis of the distribution. The
net assets contributed to the Company by Old Point360 are shown as Invested
Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The actions contemplated by the
Agreements were completed on August 14, 2007. The Company adopted a June 30
fiscal year end. See Note 10.
The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts and
transactions of the Company , including those of Old Point360s only
subsidiary, International Video Conversions, Inc. IVC. The financial
statements are presented as consolidated since IVCs stock was contributed to
the Company pursuant to the Agreements. The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
The
Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows
may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect
what the combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows
would
have been had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during
the
periods presented, including changes in its operations and capitalization as
a
result of the separation and distribution from Old Point360.
Certain
corporate and general and administrative expenses, including those related
to
executive management, tax, accounting, legal and treasury services, have been
allocated by Old Point360 to the Company based on the ratio of the Companys
revenues to Old Point360s total revenues. Additionally, balance sheet amounts
shown as Due to Parent Company and Due to Parent Company, less current
portion have been allocated by Old Point360 to the Company based on the ratio
of the Companys working capital and net fixed assets to total Old Point360
working capital and net fixed assets, respectively. Management believes such
allocations represent a reasonable estimate of such expenses that would have
been incurred by the Company on a stand-alone basis. However, the associated
balance sheet amounts and expenses recorded by the Company in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements may not be indicative of the actual balance
or
expenses that would have been recorded or incurred had the Company been
operating as a separate, stand-alone public company for the periods presented.
Following the separation and distribution from Old Point360, the Company will
perform administrative functions using internal resources or purchased
services.
The
process of segregating the post production business and the ads business
required the following:
Separation
of sales, cost of sales, facility rents, personnel and other costs
specifically related to each
business.
Allocation
of costs shared by all Old Point360 businesses such as accounting,
sales
and information technology, based on either specific criteria or
an
allocation based on sales, asset levels or another appropriate means.
For
example, interest expense related to Old Point360 term and revolving
credit loans was allocated based on property and equipment and accounts
receivable balances of the post production and ads businesses,
respectively. Accounting billing, credit and collection, etc. was
allocated based on sales.
Assets
and liabilities related to each business were identified and assigned
to
post or ads businesses.
Virtually
all of the ads business was performed in five isolated facilities.
29
Invested
equity at December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 and June 30, 2007 reflects the
application of estimating techniques described above on those dates. Changes
in
invested equity from year to year are due to the income or loss of the Company
and the net effect of the changes in balance sheet accounts determined by such
estimating techniques.
In
presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management makes estimates
and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates,
by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly,
actual results could differ from those estimates.
Business
Description
The
Company provides high definition and standard definition digital mastering,
data
conversion, video and film asset management and sophisticated computer graphics
services to owners, producers and distributors of entertainment and advertising
content. The Company provides the services necessary to edit, master, reformat,
convert, archive and ultimately distribute its clients film and video content,
including television programming feature films and movie trailers. The Companys
interconnected facilities provide service coverage to all major U.S. media
centers. Clients include major motion picture studios, advertising agencies
and
corporations.
The
Company operates in a single business segment from seven locations. Each
location is electronically tied to the others and serves the same customer
base.
Depending on the location size, the production equipment consists of tape
duplication, feature movie and commercial ad editing, encoding, standards
conversion, and other machinery. Each location employs personnel with the skills
required to efficiently run the equipment and handle customer requirements.
While all locations are not exactly the same, an order received at one location
may be fulfilled at one or more sister facilities to use resources in the most
efficient manner.
Typically,
a feature film or television show will be submitted to a facility by a motion
picture studio, independent producer, advertising agency, or corporation for
processing and distribution. A common sales force markets the Companys
capability for all facilities. Once an order is received, the local customer
service representative determines the most cost-effective way to perform the
services considering geographical logistics and facility
capabilities.
The
Company does not have the systems to adequately segregate revenues for each
product and service as orders can be for multiple services performed at several
facilities. Providing information contemplated by paragraph 37 of FAS 131 is
impracticable.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Use
of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
Cash
equivalents represent highly liquid short-term investments with original
maturities of less than three months.
Revenues
and Receivables
The
Company records revenues when the services have been completed. Although sales
and receivables are concentrated in the entertainment industry, credit risk
due
to financial insolvency is limited because of the financial stability of the
customer base i.e., large studios. 
30
Concentration
of Credit Risk
Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable.
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality
financial institutions; at times, such balances with any one financial
institution may exceed FDIC insured limits.
Credit
risk with respect to trade receivables is concentrated due to the large number
of orders with major entertainment studios in any particular reporting period.
Our five largest studio customers represented 57%; 72% and 55% of accounts
receivable at December 31, 2005, December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007,
respectively. The Company reviews credit evaluations of its customers but does
not require collateral or other security to support customer
receivables.
The
five
largest studio customersaccounted
for 28%, 52%, 58% and 56% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2005 and 2006 and the six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively. Twentieth
Century Fox and affiliates was the only customer, which accounted for more
than 10% of net sales in any of these periods, or 26%, 33% and 34%, in 2005,
2006 and the six months ended June 30, 2007, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories
comprise raw materials, principally tape stock, and are stated at the lower
of
cost or market. Cost is determined using the average cost method.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions and major
improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Amortization
of
leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the
lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining lease
term.
Goodwill
Prior
to
the January 1, 2002 implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS
142, goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 - 20 years. Since
that date, goodwill has been subject to periodic impairment tests in accordance
with SFAS 142.
The
Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets, including
goodwill that is not identified with an impaired asset, when events and
circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. Events and
circumstances that may indicate that an asset is impaired include significant
decreases in the market value of an asset, a change in the operating model
or
strategy and competitive forces.
The
Company evaluates its goodwill on an annual basis and when events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amount
of
an asset may not be recoverable. If the independent appraisal or other indicator
of value of the asset or the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable
to the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss
equal to the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value is
recorded. In 2007, fair value was determined using an independent appraisal,
which was then compared to the carrying amount of the Company including
goodwill. To date, no such impairment has been recorded.
Amounts
shown as Goodwill in the accompanying balance sheets represent the amounts
of
Old Point360s goodwill allocable to the Company see Note 3 for the allocation
method. Certain disclosures in the footnotes include a discussion of Old
Point360s goodwill as opposed to only that allocable to the Company to
provide an explanation of the total goodwill to be allocated.
Income
Taxes
The
Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accountingfor
Income Taxes SFAS
109. SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of assets
and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded for that portion of deferred
tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the assets will not be
realized.
31
Advertising
Costs
Advertising
costs are not significant to the Companys operations and are expensed as
incurred.
Fair
Value of Financial Instruments
To
meet
the reporting requirements of SFAS No. 107, Disclosures
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments
SFAS
107, the Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and
includes this additional information in the notes to financial statements when
the fair value is different than the book value of those financial instruments.
When the fair value is equal to the book value, no additional disclosure is
made. The Company uses quoted market prices whenever available to calculate
these fair values.
Pro
Forma Earnings Loss Per Share
Old
Point360 has historically followed SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS
128, and related interpretations for reporting Earnings per Share. SFAS 128
requires dual presentation of Basic Earnings per Share Basic EPS and Diluted
Earnings per Share Diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the reported period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if a company had a stock option plan and stock options
were exercised using the treasury stock method. While the Company will be
subject to FAS128, pro forma earnings per share in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income Loss have been calculated based on the
actual number of the Companys shares outstanding upon separation.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In
February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.
155, Accounting
for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments
SFAS
155, which amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS
133 and SFAS No. 140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
Liabilities
SFAS
140. SFAS 155 amends SFAS 133 to narrow the scope exception for interest-only
and principal-only strips on debt instruments to include only such strips
representing rights to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest
or principal cash flows. SFAS 155 also amends SFAS 140 to allow qualifying
special-purpose entities to hold a passive derivative financial instrument
pertaining to beneficial interests that itself is derivative instrument. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new Standard, but believes
that it will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
32
In
March
2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No.
140.
The
provisions of SFAS 156 are effective for fiscal years beginning after September
15, 2006. This statement was issued to simplify the accounting for servicing
rights and to reduce the volatility that results from using different
measurement attributes. The Company is currently assessing the impact that
the
adoption of SFAS 156 will have on its results of operation and financial
position.
In
July
2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No.
109
FIN
48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income
tax law. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain
tax
positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. This statement
is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. If there are
changes in net assets as a result of application of FIN 48, these will be
accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings. As a result of the
Companys investigation, the Company did not recognize any increase in the
liability for unrecognized tax benefit and did not record a cumulative effect
adjustment related to the adoption of FIN 48.
In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements.
SFAS 157
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. The Company is required to adopt the provision of
SFAS
157, as applicable, beginning in fiscal year 2008. Management does not believe
the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on the Companys financial
position or results of operations.
In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The
Fair Value Options for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities- Including
an
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115
SFAS
159,
which
expands the use of fair value. Under SFAS 159 a company may elect to use fair
value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and
held-to-maturity securities, equity method investments, accounts payable,
guarantees, issued debt and other eligible financial instruments. SFAS 159
is
effective for years beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not believe that
SFAS 159 will have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows
3.
ACQUISITIONS
During
1997 to 2007, Old Point360 acquired eleven businesses. These acquisitions
were
accounted for as purchases, with the excess of the purchase price over the
fair
value of the net assets acquired allocated to goodwill. The contingent portion
of the purchase prices, to the extent earned was recorded as an increase to
goodwill. As of June 30, 2007, additional purchase price earn-out payments
are
as described below. The consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect
the operations of the acquired post production companies since their respective
acquisition dates.
Old
Point360s goodwill and other intangibles, net, as of December 31, 2005 and
2006 and June 30, 2007 consist of the following:

Old
Point360 ceased amortizing goodwill on January 1, 2002 with the adoption of
SFAS 142. The covenant not to compete was fully amortized in 2003.
Old
Point360 operated in a single business segment due to the combination of
facility assets, sales forces and management subsequent to the acquisitions,
and
the integration of branding and communications efforts. The goodwill acquired,
therefore, is common to all Old Point360 facilities. As of December 31, 2005
and 2006 and June 30, 2007, the goodwill assignable to the Company was
$8,665,000, $9,253,000 and $9,868,000, respectively, determined by comparing
the
value of the Company determined by an independent appraiser to the value of
the
advertising distribution business of Old Point360 as evidenced by the market
value of consideration to be paid by DG FastChannel for the advertising
distribution business.
33
In
order
to expand relationships with our studio customers and gain new customers, on
July 1, 2004, Old Point360 acquired all of the outstanding stock of IVC for
$7
million in cash. The purchase agreement required possible additional payments
of
$1 million, $2 million and $2 million in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively,
if
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the 30
months after the acquisition reached certain predetermined levels the second
two increments of $2 million each were earned and are reflected as accrued
liabilities on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2005 and 2006,
respectively. As part of the transaction, Old Point360 entered into employment
and/or non competition agreements with four senior officers of IVC which fixed
responsibilities, salaries and other benefits and set forth limitations on
the
individuals ability to compete with Old Point360 for the term of the earn-out
period 30 months. IVC is a high definition and standard definition digital
mastering and data conversion entity serving the motion picture/television
production industry. To pay for the acquisition, Old Point360 used $23 million
of cash on hand and borrowed $47 million under the term loan portion of Old
Point360s bank facility.
The
total
purchase consideration $12 million paid as of June 30, 2007 has been allocated
to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective estimated
fair
values as summarized below.

On
March
7, 2007, Old Point360 acquired substantially all of the assets and business
of
Eden FX, Inc. Eden for $22 million cash. The purchase agreement requires
possible additional payments of $07 million, $09 million and $12 million
in
2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, if earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization during the three years after the acquisition
reach
certain predetermined levels. As part of the transaction, Old Point360 entered
into employment and non competition agreements with three senior officers of
Eden which fix responsibilities, salaries and other benefits and set forth
limitations on the individuals ability to compete with the Company for the term
of the earn-out period three years. Eden is a producer computer generated
visual effects for feature films, television program and commercial advertising
content.
The
total
purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired

During
2005, the amount of Point360s goodwill, net, increased from $27,288,000 to
$29,474,000 due to the $2,000,000 earn-out payment accrued for the IVC
acquisition and $186,000 of excess of fair value of stock issued over the fair
value of purchased assets, as noted above. During 2006, the amount of goodwill,
net, increased from $29,474,000 to $31,474,000 due to the $2,000,000 earn-out
payment accrued for the IVC acquisition. During the six months ended June 30,
2007, the amount of goodwill, net, increased from $31,474,000 to $33,568,000
due
to the acquisition of Eden. As described above, a portion of Old Point360s
goodwill, including goodwill from the IVC transaction has been allocated to
the
Company.

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT:
In
November 2003, Old Point360 leased a new 64,600 square foot building in Los
Angeles, California which building is used by the Company for the purpose
of
consolidating four vault locations then occupying approximately 71,000 square
feet. This and the subsequent transactions related to the building have been
treated as Point360 transactions in the accompanying financial statements.
Therefore the Company is treated as the owner.
As
part
of the transaction, Old Point360 paid $600,000 for an option to purchase the
facility for $8,571,500. Additionally, the landlord, General Electric Capital
Business Asset Funding Corporation General Electric, committed to finance
approximately $6,500,000 of the purchase price at a fixed interest rate of
775%
over 15 years. Old Point360 was not obligated to purchase the building or,
if
the option was exercised, borrow any portion of the purchase price from General
Electric. The cost of the option was included in other assets on the balance
sheet as of December 31, 2003, to be capitalized as a cost of the building
or
written off when the Company exercised the purchase option or did not exercise
the option, respectively.
35
Pursuant
to the lease, General Electric also advanced Old Point360 $800,000 to pay
for
improvements to the building. As of December 31, 2003, the $800,000 was
reflected as an obligation to purchase property and equipment with an offsetting
liability on the balance sheet. In 2004, Old Point360 reduced the right and
the
obligation to purchase property and equipment by $800,000 expended for
improvements to the building. In August 2004, Point360 purchased the facility
for $86 million $22 in cash and a $64 million mortgage.
In
March
2006, Old Point360 entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with respect
to its Media Center vaulting real estate. The real estate was sold for
approximately $140 million resulting in a $13 million after tax gain.
Additionally, Old Point360 received $05 million from the purchaser for
improvements. In accordance with SFAS No. 28, Accounting
for Sales with Leasebacks,
the
gain will be amortized over the initial 15-year lease term as reduced rent.
Net
proceeds at the closing of the sale and the improvement advance approximately
$138 million were used to pay off the mortgage and other outstanding
debt.
The
lease
is treated as an operating lease for financial reporting purposes. After the
initial lease term, the Company has four five-year options to extend the lease.
Minimum annual rent payments for the initial five years of the lease are
$1,111,000, increasing annually thereafter based on the consumer price index
change from year to year.
The
following table presents the Companys unaudited pro forma results the year
ended December 31, 2005, as if the sale and leaseback transaction had occurred
as of the beginning of the year. The pro forma information presented below

PLAN
The
Company has a 401K plan, which covers substantially all employees. Each
participant is permitted to make voluntary contributions not to exceed the
lesser of 20% of his or her respective compensation or the applicable statutory
limitation, and is immediately 100% vested. The Company matches one-fourth
of
the first 4% contributed by the employee. Contributions to the plan related
to
employees of the Company were $60,000, $92,000, $84,000 and $53,000 in 2004,
2005, 2006, and 2007 respectively.
6.
LONG
TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE:
On
December 30, 2005, Old Point360 entered into a $10 million term loan agreement.
The term loan provides for interest at LIBOR 538% as of June 30, 2007 plus
315% and is secured by Old Point360s equipment. In March 2006, Old Point360
prepaid $4 million of the principal with proceeds of a sale/leaseback
transaction. The term loan will be repaid in 60 equal monthly principal payments
plus interest. Proceeds of the term loan were used to repay the previously
existing term loan.
In
March
2006, Point360 entered into a revolving credit agreement, which provided up
to
$10 million of revolving credit. The two-year agreement provided for interest
of
LIBOR 538% as of June 30, 2007 plus 185% for the first six months of the
agreement, and thereafter at either i prime minus 0% - 100% or ii LIBOR
plus 150% - 25%, depending on the level of Old Point360s ratio of
outstanding debt to fixed charges as defined. The facility was secured by
all
of Old Point360s assets, except for equipment securing the new term loan as
described in Note 6. The revolving credit agreement required Old Point360
to
comply with various financial and business covenants. As of December 31, 2006
and June 30, 2007, Point360 was in compliance with revolving and term loan
agreement covenants.
On
March
30, 2007, Old Point360 entered into an additional $25 million term loan
agreement. The loan provides for interest at 835% per annum and is secured
by
the Companys equipment. The loan will be repaid in 45 equal monthly
installments of principal and interest. 
In
August
2007 the Company entered into a new credit agreement which provides up to $8
million of revolving credit based on 80% of acceptable accounts receivables,
as
defined. The two-year agreement provides for interest of either 1 prime 775%
at August 14, 2007 minus 0%-100% or 2 LIBOR plus 150% - 250% depending
on
the level of the Companys ratio of outstanding debt to fixed charges as
defined, or 675% or 675%, respectively, on August 14, 2007, the effective
date of the new agreement. The facility is secured by all of the Companys
assets, except for equipment securing new term loans as described above.
The
total
purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired
based on their respective estimated fair values as summarized
below.
Annual
maturities for debt under bank term note obligations as of June 30, 2007, are

the Board of Directors approved the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan the 2007
Plan. The 2007 Plan provides for the award of options to purchase up to
2,000,000 shares of common stock, appreciation rights and restricted stock
awards. There were no options outstanding under the 2007 Plan as of June
30,
2007. 
Under
the
2007 Plan, the stock option price per share for options granted is determined
by
the Board of Directors and is based on the market price of the Companys common
stock on the date of grant, and each option is exercisable within the period
and
in the increments as determined by the Board, except that no option can be
exercised later than ten years from the grant date. The stock options generally
vest over one to five years.
The
Company has adopted SFAS 123R which requires the measurement and recognition
of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees
and
directors based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R requires companies
to
estimate the fair value of the award that is ultimately expected to vest
to be
recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated
Statements of Income Loss.
