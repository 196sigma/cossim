ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Mail-Well, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Mail-Well, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedules for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003
listed in the Index at a2. These financial statements and
schedules are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Mail-Well, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION. Mail-Well, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively,
the Company are engaged in commercial printing, the printing and
manufacturing of envelopes and the printing and manufacturing of business
forms and labels. The Company, headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, is
organized under Colorado law, and its common stock is traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol MWL.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Mail-Well, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In October 2003, the
Company reorganized into two business segments: commercial and resale.
Prior to this reorganization, the Company was organized into three business
segments based on product lines: commercial printing, envelope and printed
office products. Refer to Note 17 for disclosures related to the Company
operating segments. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated and all amounts and disclosures reflect the Company
continuing operations and the Company new segment reporting.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, establishing the allowance for doubtful
accounts, inventory valuation reserves, depreciation and amortization, tax
assets and liabilities, self-insurance accruals and other contingencies.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue is recognized at the time product is
shipped or title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the
customer, the amount due from the customer is fixed, and collectibility of
the related receivable is reasonably assured.
FREIGHT COSTS. The costs of delivering finished goods to the Company
customers are recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales. Any
freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in net sales.
ADVERTISING COSTS. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs were $57 million, $60 million and $65 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
deposit and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair
value.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the
invoiced amount. The Company maintains a valuation allowance based upon the
expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Account balances are
charged to the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted
and the potential for recovery is remote. Allowances for losses on accounts
receivable of $40 million and $47 million have been applied as reductions
of accounts receivable at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost includes
materials, labor and overhead. The Company estimates reserves for
unsaleable inventory based on management judgment of future realization.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment are stated
at cost. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related
costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Expenditures for repairs
and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and expenditures that
increase the capacity, efficiency

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
or useful lives of existing assets are capitalized. The recoverability of
property, plant and equipment is periodically reviewed by management based
on current and anticipated conditions.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of 15 to 45 years for buildings and improvements, 10
to 15 years for machinery and equipment and three to 10 years for furniture
and fixtures.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE. The Company develops and purchases software for
internal use. Software development costs incurred during the application
development stage are capitalized. Once the software has been installed and
tested and is ready for use, additional costs incurred in connection with
the software are expensed as incurred. Capitalized computer software costs
are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, usually
between three and five years. Net computer software costs included in
property, plant and equipment were $87 million and $75 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. Direct expenses such as legal, accounting and
underwriting fees incurred to issue debt, are reported in the consolidated
balance sheets as other assets. These deferred financing fees, which were
$156 million and $189 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, net of accumulated amortization, are amortized over the term
of the related debt as interest expense. Interest expense includes $40
million, $54 million and $60 million of amortized deferred financing fees
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Goodwill represents the excess of
acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years prior to
2002. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings,
but instead is reviewed annually to determine if there is an impairment, or
more frequently, if an indication of possible impairment exits. The Company
performed its impairment assessments in the fourth quarters of 2003 and
2002 and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill other than the
transitional impairment recognized upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Refer
to Note 2 for disclosures related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142.
Other intangible assets primarily arise from the purchase price
allocations of businesses acquired and are based on independent appraisals
or internal estimates and are amortized on a straight-line basis over
appropriate periods.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on
the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be
recoverable, as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated
future undiscounted cash flows generated by their use. Impaired assets are
written down to their estimated fair market value. Assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value
less costs to sell.
SELF-INSURANCE. The Company is self-insured for the majority of its
workers' compensation costs and group health insurance costs, subject to
specific retention levels. The Company records its liability for workers'
compensation claims on a developed basis. The Company liability for
health insurance claims includes an estimate for claims incurred but not
reported.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than
the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. The effects of
translation are included as a component of other comprehensive income.
Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly rate.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in income when
realized.

expense to be recognized for the excess of the quoted market price of the
stock at the grant date or the measurement date over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145,
Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections, on January 1, 2003. The
provisions of SFAS No. 145 required the reclassification of the loss from
the early extinguishment of debt that was recorded as an extraordinary item
in 2002 into income from continuing operations and the restatement of the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002.

instruments and hedging activities and requires contracts with similar
characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable basis. The adoption of
SFAS No. 149, which is effective for contracts entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003, did not have an impact on the Company financial
condition or results of operations.
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how to classify and measure certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of
the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of
SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on the Company financial condition or
results of operations.
In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 revised 2003,
Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,
that improves financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans.
The change replaces existing SFAS No. 132 disclosure requirements for
pensions and other postretirement benefits and revises employers'
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It
does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by
SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88, Employers'
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension
Plans and for Termination Benefits. SFAS No. 132 retains the disclosure
requirements contained in the original SFAS No. 132, but requires
additional disclosures about the plan assets, obligations, cash flows, and
net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
defined benefit postretirement plans. SFAS No. 132 is effective for annual
and interim periods with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The
Company adopted the revised disclosure provisions as of December 31, 2003.
On December 17, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which
supersedes SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB
No. 104 primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in
SAB No. 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements. The adoption
of SAB No. 104 did not have an impact on the Company recognition of
revenue.
2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
FASB Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, FIN 46 issued
in January 2003 introduced a new consolidation model, the variable interest
model, which determines control and whether an entity is to be consolidated
based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity. Variable
interests are contractual, ownership or other interests in an entity that
expose its holders to the risks and rewards of the variable interest entity
VIE. Variable interests include equity investments, loans, leases,
derivatives, guarantees and other instruments whose values change with
changes in the VIE assets.
The Company leases printing equipment from a bankruptcy-remote trust
the Trust under an operating lease. At the end of the lease, the
Company has the option to purchase the equipment for the aggregate
outstanding loan balance of the Trust or to direct the sale of the
equipment to a third party. If the Company were to direct the sale of the
equipment, it has guaranteed the Trust that the proceeds from the sale will
be at least 609% of the original fair value of the leased assets which
could be as much as $116 million. If the sales proceeds exceed the
guaranteed value of the leased assets, the Company retains the excess.
The Company is the primary beneficiary of this Trust, a VIE, and is
therefore required by FIN 46 to consolidate the Trust in its financial
statements. The Company adopted FIN 46 effective January 1, 2003 and
consolidated equipment valued at $181 million, net of accumulated
depreciation, and debt of

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are
no longer required to be amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets that
have indefinite useful lives, however, must be tested annually for
impairment.
In the year of its adoption, SFAS No. 142 required a transitional
goodwill impairment evaluation, which was a two-step process. The first
step was to determine whether there was an indication that goodwill was
impaired on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 required a separate impairment
evaluation of each of the Company reporting units, which the Company
determined to be the same as its operating segments. To perform the first
step, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting
the expected future cash flows and using market multiples of comparable
companies. The fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its
carrying value, including goodwill. This first step evaluation indicated an
impairment of the goodwill recorded by the Company commercial printing
operations.
Since the first step indicated an impairment of the goodwill of the
commercial printing operations, SFAS No. 142 required a second step to
determine the amount of the impairment. The amount of the impairment was
determined by comparing the implied fair value of this goodwill to its
carrying value. The implied fair value of the goodwill was determined by
allocating the fair value of the combined assets and liabilities of the
commercial printing operations as if these operations had been acquired and
the fair value was the purchase price. The excess purchase price over the
amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities was the implied value of
goodwill. The carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied value by
$1117 million, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the
year ended December 31, 2002. The impairment loss on the goodwill recorded
by the commercial printing operations formerly the commercial printing
segment was due to the significant decline in the performance of these
operations in 2001 and the impact of that decline on expected future cash
flows.

In August 2002, the Company acquired the in-house printing and
fulfillment operations of American Express Company, located in Minneapolis,
Minnesota, for $13 million with additional consideration of up to $170
million payable if annual revenues during each year of the five-year period
commencing on January 1, 2003 total a specified amount. The Company paid
additional consideration of $28 million in 2003. All additional
consideration paid will be recorded as an identified intangible. This
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase; accordingly, its assets
and liabilities have been recorded at estimated fair value with the excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair value recorded as goodwill.
The consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the
acquired business since August 2002. The total amount of goodwill related
to this acquisition at December 31, 2003 was $08 million. Sales included
in the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $645 million and $119
million, respectively.
In January 2001, the Company acquired Communigraphics, Inc., a
commercial printing and fulfillment operation in Denver, Colorado for $38
million. This acquisition was also recorded as a purchase.
4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In June 2001, the Company announced plans to sell its prime label and
printed office products operating segments. The printed office products
segment was comprised of two separate businesses, Curtis 1000 and
PrintXcel. In June 2002, the Company decided that it would not sell
PrintXcel. The prime label segment and Curtis 1000 have been segregated
from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations for all
periods presented. On February 22, 2002, the Company sold the stock of
Curtis 1000 for $400 million, including the assumption of debt. On May 21,
2002, the Company sold the prime label operating segment for $750 million.
The loss on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 2001 of $880 million included adjustments to record the prime
label segment and Curtis 1000 at net realizable value. These adjustments
were based on estimated sales proceeds, estimates of the expenses
associated with the sales of the two businesses and the estimated losses of
each business through the expected date of disposition. Management based
its estimates of the sales proceeds on data provided by its financial
advisors and indications of value received from prospective buyers.
The additional loss of $169 million on disposal of discontinued
operations recorded for the year ended December 31, 2002 was based on
actual proceeds which were less than expected, actual expenses which were
greater than originally estimated and the tax benefit of the losses which
was less than originally estimated. In addition, the cumulative translation
adjustment which related to the

4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTINUED
investment in the foreign operations of the prime label segment in the
amount of $28 million was charged to the loss on disposal of discontinued
operations as a result of the sale of these foreign subsidiaries.
The gain on disposal of discontinued operations recorded for the year
ended December 31, 2003 reflects a change in the tax impact of the
disposition of the Company prime label business, which was sold in May
2002. This gain was partially offset by the accrual of additional expenses
related to the sale.
Interest expense was allocated to the operating results and included in
the calculation of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations based
upon the relative net assets of the prime label business and Curtis 1000.
This allocation of interest expense totaled $56 million and $156 million
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Tax benefits
allocated to discontinued operations based on the losses of these
operations were $16 million and $17 million for the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized as

In connection with the proposed divestiture of the Company PrintXcel
business in 2001, the Company reduced the carrying amounts of the net
assets of PrintXcel by $336 million to the expected net realizable value
based on estimated proceeds, net of expenses associated with its sale and a
tax benefit of $115 million that would have resulted from the sale. As a
result of the Company decision in June 2002 not to sell PrintXcel, it
reversed the tax benefit because it would not be realized and $11 million
of expenses related to the sale that had been accrued but not incurred. The
$336 million charge in 2001 and the $104 million charge in 2002 have been
included in Impairment on operations formerly held for sale in the
consolidated statements of operations.

In 2001, the digital graphics operations were written down $29
million to estimated fair market value based on sales proceeds anticipated
at the time. In 2002, the Company recorded another impairment charge of
$28 million based on a change in the estimated sales proceeds. Subsequent
to this write-down, management discontinued its efforts to sell one of the
digital graphics operations originally held for sale. The $29 million
impairment charge recorded in 2001 has been included in impairment on
operations formerly held for sale in the consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. The impairment on
operations formerly held for sale in the consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 includes $25 million of
the $28 million impairment charge recorded in 2002. The remaining $03
million of the write-down was recorded as an impairment of the operations
held for sale.
A $61 million impairment charge was recorded in 2002 as a result of
the sale of the filing products division.

Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary
differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements. The tax effects of these
temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax
liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used
as a tax deduction or credit in future years. Deferred tax liabilities
generally represent items that have been deducted for tax purposes, but
have not yet been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is
more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The Company
has tax planning strategies available which will enable them to realize all
net tax assets. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to

12. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGES
The Company has responded to the impact of the current economic
environment on its businesses by continuing to evaluate its operations for
improvement opportunities. Because of the significant decline in sales
experienced over the last two years, actions to consolidate facilities,
rationalize and realign capacity, and otherwise reduce costs have been
implemented. These actions have resulted in significant restructuring and
other related charges.
2003 ACTIVITY
The Company completed most of the restructuring programs initiated in
June 2001 and continued during 2002 and 2003. Restructuring expenses
related to these programs that could not be accrued and were the result of
continuing initiatives to optimize capacity were $15 million in 2003. The

Continued efforts in 2003 to adjust the operations of both segments to
reflect lower sales volumes, resulted in employee separation expenses of
$15 million in 2003.
COMMERCIAL. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the commercial segment
announced the closure of the web printing operation in Indianapolis,
Indiana and the redeployment of its two web presses and related equipment
to St. Louis, Missouri and Baltimore, Maryland. A substantial portion of
the cost to dismantle, move and reinstall this equipment was incurred
during 2003.
The Company was able to sub-lease a facility which was idled as a
result of the consolidation of the envelope plant in the Northeast sooner
than estimated when the liability under the lease contract
45           MAIL-WELL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

was established. Accordingly, $05 million of the reserve recorded for this
lease was reversed. In addition, the remaining expenses that had been
accrued to cover the cost of maintaining a building that has been sold were
reversed.
RESALE SEGMENT. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the resale segment
closed its business forms plant in Clearwater, Florida and consolidated its
production in plants located in Fairhope, Alabama and Marshall, Texas. The
employee separation expenses and other costs incurred as a result of this
consolidation were less than originally estimated.

equipment taken out of service or sold as a result of the plant
consolidations, net of $59 million received from the sales of those
assets.

closed its business forms plant in Clearwater, Florida and its plant in
Denver, Colorado which had been curtailed in 2001. The employee separation
expenses covering 64 employees were $06 million. Impairment charges

totaled $06 million. Other expenses of $07 million primarily related to
expenses incurred to maintain the two buildings held for sale.
The resale segment completed the closure of its envelope operations in
Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The costs in 2002 were $24 million which were

OTHER CHARGES. Other charges include the following items   * In 2001, several programs to significantly improve operations and
marketing effectiveness were implemented. These programs included the
implementation of best practices, the standardization of costing and
pricing systems in the commercial segment and the alignment of
equipment and services to better serve customers and markets. Outside
assistance was used in the implementation of these programs the cost
of which was $44 million in 2002.
* In connection with the refinancing of the bank credit facility in
June 2002, an operating lease stemming from a sale/leaseback
arrangement executed in 1997 and amended in 2000 had to be
refinanced. The value of the equipment subject to the lease was
reduced from $349 million to $191 million, requiring a payment of
the difference of $158 million. In addition, deferred costs of $61
million associated with the lease prior to this refinancing were
written off.
* An impairment charge of $18 million was recorded to write-down idle
equipment in the commercial segment to net realizable value.
* Severance payments of $11 million unrelated to the restructure plans
were incurred.
* Consulting fees of $07 million related to tax matters that arose as

date of grant. The Incentive Plan provides for an acceleration of the
vesting of both the stock options and the restricted stock if the Company
stock price closes at certain levels for 20 consecutive trading days.
Upon the issuance of restricted stock, the Company records deferred
compensation as a charge to shareholders' equity for the market value of
the restricted stock on the date of grant. This deferred compensation is
being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.
The Company has awarded 684,398 shares of restricted stock of which 40,398
shares have vested. The Company recorded compensation expense in the amount
of $08 million, $06 million and $03 million for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

14. RETIREMENT PLANS
SAVINGS PLAN. The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan to
provide substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees an
opportunity to accumulate personal funds for their retirement. As
determined by the provisions of the plan, the Company matches a certain
percentage of each employee voluntary contribution. The plan also
provides for a discretionary contribution by the Company to the plan for
all eligible employees. All contributions made by the Company are made in
cash and allocated to the funds selected by the employee. Company
contributions to the plan were approximately $60 million, $65 million and
$105 million for the years ending in December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. No discretionary contributions were made in 2003 or 2002. The
plan held 2,776,000 shares of the Company common stock at December 31,
2003. Shares held in a frozen employee stock ownership plan were 2,524,000
at December 31, 2003.
PENSION PLANS. The Company maintains pension plans for certain of its
employees in the U.S. and Canada under collective bargaining agreements
with unions representing these employees. The Company expects to continue
to fund these plans based on governmental requirements, amounts deductible
for income tax purposes and as needed to ensure that plan assets are
sufficient to satisfy plan liabilities.
SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS. As a result of the acquisition
of American Business Products ABP in 2000, the Company assumed
responsibility for the ABP supplemental executive retirement plans SERP
which provide benefits to certain former directors and executives of ABP.
For accounting purposes, these plans are unfunded; however, ABP had
purchased annuities, which are included in other assets in the consolidated
balance sheets, to cover the benefits for certain participants.

Rate of compensation     35-4%     3-4%    2-4   The Company overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is
80%. The expected return on assets assumption is based on the long-term
expected return on the U.S. and Canadian investment portfolios as estimated
by the Company investment advisors. The portfolio return for the U.S.
pension plans is calculated based on capital market projections of returns,
risks and correlations of these asset classes projected five-years out. The
portfolio return for the Canadian portfolio is calculated based upon the
long-term rate for Canadian bonds and projected long-term equity returns
plus an additional 075% for active management of the investment portfolio.
The allocations of the assets of the pension plans at December 31, 2003

equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term
return on the assets of the pension plans for a prudent level of risk. In
order to achieve investment objectives, target asset allocations have been
established and are reviewed quarterly. The intent of this strategy is to
minimize pension cost by outperforming liabilities of the pension plans
over the long run. Risk tolerance is established through careful
consideration of the liabilities and the funded status of the pension plans
and the Company financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a
diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments. Furthermore,
equity investments are diversified across U.S. and non-U.S. stocks as well
as growth, value, and small and large capitalizations.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. The Company has limited concentrations
of credit risk with respect to financial instruments. Temporary cash
investments and other investments are placed with high credit quality
institutions, and concentrations within accounts receivable are limited due
to the Company customer base and its dispersion across different
industries and geographic areas.
LITIGATION. The Company is party to various legal actions that are
ordinary and incidental to its business. Refer to Note 19 for disclosure
related to the settlement of a lawsuit. While the outcome of pending legal
actions cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the outcome
of these various proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
TAX AUDITS. The Company income, sales and use, and other tax returns
are routinely subject to audit by various authorities. The Company believes
that the resolution of any matters raised during such audits will not have
a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or results of
operations.

Basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing
net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings loss per share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. A
reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of basic earnings

17. SEGMENT INFORMATION
In October 2003, the Company reorganized into two business segments:
commercial and resale. This reorganization aligns the structure with the
Company distribution channels and with the Company principle strategic
goals: to operate as one company; to provide customers with one point of
entry into Mail-Well; and to go to market with a complete range of products
and services. Segment data for prior years has been restated to reflect the
new operating segments.
The commercial segment consists of commercial printing facilities that
specialize in printing of annual reports, car brochures, brand marketing
collateral, catalogs, maps and guidebooks, calendars, financial
communications, and facilities that produce customized envelopes for
billing and remittance and direct mail advertising. The resale segment
includes facilities that produce specialty packaging, customized and stock
labels, envelopes, and printed business documents which are sold to
distributors and value-added resellers of office products. Intercompany
sales for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $1645 million, $1427 million and
$1770 million, respectively, which are eliminated in consolidation and
excluded from reported net sales.
Operating income includes all costs and expenses directly related to
the segment involved. Corporate expenses include corporate general and
administrative expenses, amortization expense, and gains and losses on
disposal of assets.

further litigation and appeals, the Company settled the dispute. The amount
of the settlement and the costs of the litigation are reflected in the
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003.

are joint and several, full, complete and unconditional. There are no

complete and unconditional. There are no material restrictions on the
ability of the Guarantor Subsidiaries to transfer funds to MWI in the form
of cash dividends, loans or advances, other than ordinary legal
restrictions under corporate law, fraudulent transfer and bankruptcy laws.
The following condensed consolidating financial information illustrates
the composition of the Parent Guarantor, Issuer, and Guarantor
Subsidiaries. The Issuer and the Guarantor Subsidiaries comprise all of the
direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. Management has
determined that separate complete financial statements would not provide
additional material information that would be useful in assessing the
financial composition of the Guarantor Subsidiaries.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method,
wherein the investor company share of earnings and income taxes
applicable to the assumed distribution of such earnings are included in net
income. In addition, investments increase in the amount of permanent
contributions to subsidiaries and decrease in the amount of distributions
from subsidiaries. The elimination entries remove the equity method
investment in subsidiaries and the equity in earnings of subsidiaries,
intercompany payables and receivables and other transactions between
subsidiaries.
