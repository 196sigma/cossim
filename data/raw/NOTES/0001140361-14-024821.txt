Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of CollabRx, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CollabRx, Inc and its subsidiaries the Company as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2014. The Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CollabRx, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys recurring losses from operations and negative cash flow from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. s/ Burr Pilger Mayer, Inc.

All amounts in thousands, except share and per
share data, unless otherwise noted Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company CollabRx, Inc., a Delaware corporation CollabRx, the Company or we, us,or our, is the formerly named Tegal Corporation, a Delaware corporation Tegal, which acquired a private company of the same name on July 12, 2012. Following approval by its stockholders on September 25, 2012, Tegal amended its charter and changed its name to CollabRx, Inc. the Name Change. Tegal was formed in December 1989 to acquire the operations of the former Tegal Corporation, a division of Motorola, Inc. Tegals predecessor company was founded in 1972 and acquired by Motorola, Inc. in 1978. Tegal completed its initial public offering in October 1995. Originally, Tegal designed, manufactured, marketed and serviced specialized plasma etch systems used primarily in the production of micro-electrical mechanical systems MEMS devices, such as sensors, accelerometers and power devices. Tegal also sold systems for the etching and deposition of materials found in other devices, such as integrated circuits ICs and optoelectronic devices found in products such as smart phones, networking gear, solid-state lighting, and digital imaging. As the Company transitioned away from its legacy lines of business in manufacturing and devices, it explored opportunities in various emerging technology sectors, including the photovoltaic solar and medical device industries. These efforts led to Tegals investments in Sequel Power and NanoVibronix, as well as the Companys acquisition of CollabRx, a company that develops information technology products based systems and methods for aggregating and contextualizing the worlds knowledge on genomics-based medicine, with specific applications in advanced cancer. On July 12, 2012, we completed the transition of our business model with the closing of our acquisition of CollabRx. We intend that our acquisition of CollabRx will form the core of our operations going forward. The Company sought and received stockholder approval at the annual meeting held on September 2012 for an amendment to Tegals Certificate of Incorporation, changing the corporate name to CollabRx, Inc. On January 14, 2011, the Company, se2quel Partners and Sequel Power entered into a Formation and Contribution Agreement. The Company contributed $2 million in cash to Sequel Power in exchange for an approximate 25% ownership interest in Sequel Power. Sequel Power was focused on the promotion of solar power plant development projects worldwide, the development of self-sustaining businesses from such projects, including but not limited to activities relating to and supporting, developing, building and operating solar photovoltaic fabrication facilities and solar farms, and the consideration of other non-photovoltaic renewable energy projects. The project services provided to Sequel Power represented the Companys sole source of revenue for all of fiscal 2012. On March 31, 2013, Sequel Power irrevocably assigned and transferred unto the Company for cancelation the balance of its Warrants representing the right to purchase 44,578 shares of the Companys common stock. In exchange, the Company agreed to waive receivables related to certain fees earned under its Services Agreement with Sequel Partners and its 25% ownership interest in Sequel Power. In addition, effective March 31, 2013, the Company terminated its management agreement with Sequel Power. We do not anticipate making any additional investments in Sequel Power or any other solar-related businesses. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Without additional capital, our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We may need to generate significant revenue or sell equity or debt securities to raise additional funds to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty, and contemplate the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the funds required for our continued operations. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain financing on a timely basis, we will not be able to meet our obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business. 41 Table of Contents The CollabRx Merger On July 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of CollabRx the Merger, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 29, 2012, the Merger Agreement. As a result of the Merger, CollabRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In consideration for 100% of the stock of CollabRx, we agreed to issue an aggregate of 236,433 shares of common stock, representing 14% of the Companys total shares outstanding prior to the closing, to former CollabRx stockholders. As of July 12, 2012, these shares had a fair value of $932. We also assumed $500 of existing CollabRx indebtedness through the issuance of promissory notes. The principal amount of the promissory notes is payable in equal installments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of issuance, along with the accrued but unpaid interest as of such dates. Also the note receivable balance recognized in the period prior to the acquisition date consisted of an outstanding loan related to the Companys investment in CollabRx in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. The Companys initial investment in CollabRx was in the form of a promissory note that accrued interest at a rate of 028% per year compounded annually and matured on or about November 7, 2012. After the completion of the acquisition of CollabRx, the loan was reclassified to be included as part of the purchase price, thereby extinguishing the $300 bridge loan previously extended to CollabRx. The Company did not pay any cash consideration in connection with the acquisition. In addition, Tegal granted a total of 368,417 restricted stock units RSUs and options as inducement grants to newly hired management and employees, all subject to four-year vesting and other restrictions. In December 2012, an aggregate of 215,475 RSUs were forfeited in connection with the resignation of James Karis as the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officer. On July 12, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of CollabRx, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, dated June 29, 2012, we entered into an Agreement Not to Compete with Jay M. Tenenbaum the Noncompete, pursuant to which Mr. Tenenbaum agreed to refrain from competing with the Company on the terms set forth therein for a period of three years commencing on July 12, 2012. Also on July 12, 2012, we entered into a Stockholders Agreement the Stockholders Agreement with the former stockholders of CollabRx. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, i the Company has agreed to provide certain registration rights to the stockholders, and ii the stockholders have agreed to certain transfer restrictions and voting provisions for a period of two years. In connection with the Merger Agreement and the Employment Agreement dated as of June 29, 2012 by and among the Company and James Karis, on July 12, 2012, Mr. Karis, the former Chief Executive Officer of CollabRx, was appointed the Co-Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. In December 2012, Mr. Karis resigned from his position as Co-Chief Executive Officer but remained on the Companys Board of Directors. In addition, pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement dated as of July 12, 2012 by and between the Company and James Karis the Indemnity Agreement, Mr. Karis has been granted customary indemnification rights in connection with his position as an officer and director of the Company. Additional information is set forth, including the description of the Merger provided above, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the transaction documents, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the Form 8-K reports filed July 5, 2012 and July 18, 2012. Principles of Consolidation and Foreign Currency Transactions The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Accounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the foreign currencies as the functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars at current rates of exchange and revenues and expenses are translated using weighted-average rates. The effects of translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate component of stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of operations as a component of other income expense, net, and were not material in all periods presented. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could vary from those estimates. Reclassification Certain prior year operating expense amounts were reclassified, still within operating expenses, to conform to the current year presentation. 42 Table of Contents Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt and equityinstruments having a maturity of three months or less on the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As ofMarch 31, 2014 and 2013, all of the Companys current investments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets. The investment portfolioas ofMarch 31, 2014 and 2013 is comprised of money market funds. As ofMarch 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value of the Companys investments approximated cost. Financial Instruments The carrying amount of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities approximates fair value due to their relatively short maturity. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company, the note payable carrying value approximates fair value.With our exit from our historical operations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has been mostly eliminated. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Previously, the Company would periodically enter into foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros, which are used to hedge a sales transaction in which costs were denominated in U.S. dollars and the related revenue was generated in Euros. On March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no open foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros or any other foreign currencies. Changes in the exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar are currently immaterial to our operating results. Exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves. Fair Value Measurements The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider what assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between 1 market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and 2 an entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. Level 2: Directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize managements estimates of market participant assumptions. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. The Companys financial instruments consist primarily of money market funds.AsofMarch 31, 2014, all of the Companys current assets in financial instruments investments were classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet. Our cash equivalents totaled $1,430. The investment portfolio at March 31, 2014 was comprised of money market funds. The carrying amounts of the Companys cash equivalents are valued using Level 1 inputs. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method of valuation for warrants that are subject towarrant liability accounting. The determination of the fair value as of the reporting date is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables which could provide differing variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the security and risk free interest rate. In addition, the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of an expected life for the securities for which we have estimated based upon the stage of the Companys development. The fair value of the warrant liability is revalued each balance sheet date utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model computations with the decrease or increase in the fair value being reported in the consolidated statement of operations as other income, net. A significant increase decrease of any of the subjective variables independent of other changes would result in a correlated increase decrease in the liability and an inverse effect on net income loss. The Company also had warrant liabilities which are valued using Level 3 inputs. 43 Table of Contents As of September 30, 2013, the Companys warrant liability has been extinguished, and the Company has no other financial instruments subject to using Level 3 inputs. The change in the fair value ofthe common stock warrant liabilityis as follows Year Ended March 31 2014 2013 Balance as ofthe beginning of the period 10 19 Change in fair value recorded in earnings, including expirations 10 9 Balance as ofthe end of the period 10 Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate The Company evaluates our joint venture arrangements to determine whether they should be recorded on a consolidated basis. The percentage of ownership interest in the joint venture, an evaluation of control and whether a variable interest entity VIE exists are all considered in the consolidation assessment. We account for our investment in joint ventures where we own a non-controlling interest or where we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, our cost of investment is adjusted for our share of equity in the earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate and reduced by distributions received. Any differences between the cost of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and our underlying equity as reflected in the unconsolidated affiliates financial statements generally result from a different basis in assets contributed to the joint venture. The net difference between our investment in unconsolidated affiliates and the underlying equity of unconsolidated affiliates is generally amortized over a period of ten years, which is determined to be the estimated useful life of the underlying intangibles which created the difference in carrying amount. As a result of the impairment charge taken in fiscal year 2012 for the total value against our unconsolidated affiliate, the net difference as ofMarch 31, 2013 was $0. The amortization expense related to this difference for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 was $0. On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. Our estimates of fair value for each investment are based on a number of assumptions such as future revenue projections, operating forecasts, discount rates and capitalization rates, among others. These assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties. As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions, the fair values estimated in the impairment analyses may not be realized. Our estimate of the fair value of our investment was $0 as of March 31, 2013; we previously incurred an impairment charge of our investment in our unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended March 31, 2012 in the amount of $1,377, bringing the fair value of the investment to $0 as of March 31, 2012. On March 21, 2013, Sequel Power irrevocably assigned and transferred unto the Company for cancelation the balance of its Warrants representing the right to purchase 44,578 shares of the Companys common stock. In exchange, the Company agreed to waive receivables related to certain fees earned under its Services Agreement with Sequel Partners and its 25% ownership interest in Sequel Power. In addition, effective March 31, 2013, the Company terminated its management agreement with Sequel Power. Investment in Convertible Promissory Note The Companys carrying amount of its investment in a Convertible Promissory Note approximates fair value. On a periodic basis, we assess whether there are any indicators that the fair value of our investment in Convertible Promissory Note may be impaired. An investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment, and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary. To the extent impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment. As of March 31, 2014, the Companys investment in Convertible Promissory Note consisted solely of the investment in NanoVibronix. That note bears interest at a rate of 10% per year compounded annually and matures on November 15, 2014. Interest is accrued and recognized quarterly. As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Convertible Promissory Note balance was $378 and $345, respectively, consisting of the original $300 investment and $78 and $45, respectively, in accrued interest. Should NanoVibronix, Inc. become a public company, then the Companys Chief Executive Officer will become a member of the NanoVibronix, Inc. Board of Directors. 44 Table of Contents Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments and accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Companys liquid investments are invested in money market funds. The Companys accounts receivable are derived primarily from sales to customers located in the United States. Prior to our exit from our historical core operations, the Company performed ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally required no collateral. For fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the Company had zero reserves for potential credit losses as such risk was determined to be immaterial. The Company does not currently maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for potential estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company believes no such reserve is currently required. The Company had zero write-offs during fiscal years 2014 and 2013. The Company reviews the estimated risk of current customers inability to make payments on a quarterly basis to determine if any amount is uncollectible. As of March 31, 2014, four customers accounted for 100% of the accounts receivable balance. One customer accounted for 100% of the accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2014, the balance in accounts receivable was $148. As of March 31, 2013, the balance in accounts receivable was $250 and one customer accounted for 100% of the Companys accounts receivable balance. Life Technologies, Inc. has been a major contributor to our revenues and gross profits for the past two fiscal years, however we have funded the Companys operating expenses primarily with cash on hand and the net proceeds from the sale of discontinued assets, as disclosed in prior and current filings. We are actively engaged in negotiations with several other companies who are interested in purchasing our content on similar terms or under annual subscriptions or software-as-a-service arrangements. For the period ended March 31, 2014, Life Technologies Inc. amount due in the Companys accounts receivable balance was zero. The Company sold the last two patent lots for approximately $365 in the second quarter of the current fiscal year. The Company received the funds from the patent sales in the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the lease term. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations. The Company generally depreciates its assets over the following periods Years Furniture and machinery and equipment 7 Computer and software 3 5 Leasehold improvements 5 or remaining lease life Intangible Assets Intangibles include acquired technology, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and trademarks that are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 years to 10 years. The Company performs an ongoing review of its identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances exist that indicate the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flow associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Intangible assets, except for trade names, are amortized on a straight-line basis. Intangible assets related to trade names are not amortized. The Company tests for impairment at least annually. The amortization expense included in cost of revenue is related to the acquired software and is amortized on a straight line basis over the expected life of the asset, which the Company believes to be ten years. No impairment charges for intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years ended 2014 and 2013. Prior to the acquisition of CollabRx, all of the Companys historical intangible assets, other than those related to NLD and Compact, were included in the asset sale of the DRIE product line to SPTS. The last of the intangible assets related to NLD and Compact were sold in the second quarter in fiscal year 2014. 45 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable as well as at fiscal year end. If undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. No impairment charges for intangible assets were recorded for the fiscal years ended 2014 and 2013, respectively, since all of the Companys historical intangible assets, other than those related to NLD and Compact, were included in the asset sale of the DRIE product line to SPTS. As the Companys NLD patents and intellectual property were all internally developed except for those acquired in connection with the Simplus acquisition, which were subsequently written-off the value of the Companys NLD technology had no recorded value prior to sale. Long-lived assets also consist of property, plant and equipment. The Company recorded disposal losses of $0 and $17 for fixed assets for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In fiscal year 2013, the Company disposed of certain assets in connection with the relocation of its main offices from Petaluma, CA to San Francisco, CA. DeferredFinancing Costs Deferred financing costs represent expenses incurred to raise equity capital related to financing transactions which have not yet been completed as of the balance sheet dates. Accounts Receivable Allowance for Sales Returns and Doubtful Accounts For fiscal years 2014 and 2013, the Company had zero reserves for potential credit losses as such risk was determined to be immaterial. The Company does not currently maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for potential estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company believes no such reserve is currently required. The Company had zero write-offs during fiscal years 2014 and 2013. The Company reviews the estimated risk of current customers inability to make payments on a quarterly basis to determine if any amount is uncollectible. As of March 31, 2014, the balance in accounts receivable was $148. As of March 31, 2013, the balance in accounts receivable was $250. As of March 31, 2014, four customers accounted for 100% of the accounts receivable balance. One customer accounted for 100% of the accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2013. Revenue Recognition Each contract sale of our interpretive data is evaluated individually in regard to revenue recognition. We had integrated in our evaluation the related guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 605 Revenue Recognition. We recognized revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sellers price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For arrangements that include multiple deliverables, we identify separate units of accounting based on the guidance under ASC 605-25, Multiple Element Arrangements, which provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting, if certain criteria are met. The consideration of the arrangement is allocated to the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method. Applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each separate unit of accounting. Revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized primarily under the percentage of completion method. Under this method we recognize estimated contract revenue and resulting income based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated costs as we consider this model to best reflect the economics of these contracts. In such contracts, the Companys efforts, measured by time incurred, typically represents the contractual milestones or output measure. 46 Table of Contents Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Under ASC 740, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. ASC 740 also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance, if necessary. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. In 2014 and 2013, we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our past losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income. In future periods, if we are able to generate income we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive securities, except when the effect of including such changes is antidilutive. The weighted-average number of shares and the loss income per share reflect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split effected by the Company on June 15, 2011. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation ASC 718 which establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the employees service period. We have adopted several stock plans that provide for issuance of equity instruments to our employees and non-employee directors. Our plans include incentive and non-statutory stock options and restricted stock awards. These equity awards generally vest ratably over a four-year period on the anniversary date of the grant, and stock options expire ten years after the grant date. Restricted stock awards do not expire. Certain restricted stock awards may vest on the achievement of specific performance targets. We also have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP that allows qualified employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the fair market value on specified dates. The ESPP plan expires on July 22, 2014. Comprehensive Loss Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of the Company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no items of other comprehensive loss. Therefore, the net loss equals comprehensive loss for the years then ended. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The new guidance requires entities to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income unless the amounts are not reclassified in their entirety to net income. For amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, entities are required to cross-reference other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts. The new guidance was effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2012. and had no See Note 5, Discontinued Operations. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, Foreign Currency Matters Topic 830: Parent Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2013-05. ASU 2013-05 clarifies that when a parent reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity, the parent is required to apply the guidance in ASC 830-30 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income. Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. ASU 2013-05 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2013. The new guidance was adopted early. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Income Taxes Topic 740: Presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2013-11. The new guidance requires entities to report an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether a deferred tax asset is available is based on the unrecognized tax benefit and deferred tax asset that exist at the reporting date and should be made presuming disallowance of the tax position at the reporting date. The new guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 47 Table of Contents In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements Topic 205 and Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic 360: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ASU 2014-08, which changes the requirements for reporting discontinued operations in Subtopic 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations. The ASU changes the definition of discontinued operations by limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals that represent strategic shifts that have or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. Under current U.S. GAAP, many disposals, some of which may be routine in nature and not representative of a substantive change in an entitys strategy, are reported in discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations designed to provide users of financial statements with more information about the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows related to discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 also requires an entity to disclose the pretax profit or loss or change in net assets for a not-for-profit entity of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The amendments in ASU 2014-08 are effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued or available for issuance. The Company does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 5, Discontinued Operations. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 and the IASB has issued IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The issuance of these documents completes the joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by creating common revenue recognition guidance for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The new guidance affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. For public entities, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The Company will continue to evaluate this newly issued guidance. Note 2.

The Company retained the internally developed NLD patents and has sold all of these patents as of March 31, 2014. Note 4. Earnings Per Share EPS Basic EPS is computed by dividing income loss available to common stockholders numerator by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding denominator for the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS uses the average market prices during the period. All amounts in the following table are in thousands except per share data. The weighted-average number of shares and the loss income per share reflect a 1-for-5 reverse stock split effected by the Company on June 15, 2011. Basic net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. The following table represents the calculation of basic and diluted net income loss per common share in thousands, except per share data Year Ended March 31 2014 2013 Loss from continuing operations 3,469 3,973 Net income from discontinued operations, net of taxes 155 45 Net loss applicable to common stockholders 3,314 3,928 Basic and diluted Weighted-average common shares outstanding 1,965 1,856 Weighted-average common shares used in per share computation 1,965 1,856 Net loss per share from continuing operations Basic and diluted 177 214 Net income per share from discontinued operations Basic and diluted 008 002 Net loss per share Basic and diluted 169 212 Outstanding options, warrants and RSUs of 500,809 and 448,986, at a weighted-average exercise price of $1017 and $723,as ofMarch 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted net loss income per common share for the periods presented as a result of their anti-dilutive effect. Such securities could potentially dilute earnings per share in future periods. Note 5. Discontinued Operations Until 2011, we designed, manufactured, marketed and serviced specialized plasma etch systems used primarily in the production of micro-electrical mechanical systems devices, such as sensors, accelerometers and power devices. Previously, we also sold systems for the etching and deposition of materials found in other devices, such as integrated circuits and optoelectronic devices found in products such as smart phones, networking gear, solid-state lighting, and digital imaging. 49 Table of Contents In a series of meetings in late May and early June 2009, our Board of Directors reviewed several basic strategic options presented by management, including investigating opportunities for the sale of the Company or its assets. In December 2009, having received no bona fide offers for the Company as a going concern, the Board and management agreed to continue operations and to offer selected asset groups to potential buyers. On March 19, 2010, we completed the sale of the legacy Etch and PVD assets to OEM Group, Inc. We discontinued our development efforts in NLD at the end of fiscal 2010, and began offering these assets for sale to third-parties. At the same time, we began the process of closing and/or liquidating all of our other wholly-owned subsidiary companies, including SFI and Tegal GmbH, along with branches in Taiwan, Korea and Italy. The subsidiaries were then included in discontinued operations. On February 9, 2011, the Company and SPTS entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement. That agreement included the sale of all of the shares of Tegal France, SAS, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary and product lines and certain equipment, intellectual property and other assets relating to the DRIE systems and certain related technology. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the DRIE business operations related to the designing, manufacturing, marketing and servicing of systems and parts within the semiconductor industry was presented in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts for the prior periods were reclassified to conform to this presentation. The exit from the DRIE operation was essentially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of our 2011 fiscal year. The assets and liabilities of discontinued operations are presented separately under the captions Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheetsas ofMarch 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and consist of the following March 31 March 31 2014 2013 Assets of Discontinued Operations Accounts and other receivables, net of allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts of $0 4 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 7 Total assets of discontinued operations 11 Liabilities of Discontinued Operations Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 5 16 Total liabilities of discontinued operations 5 16 As of March 31, 2014, discontinued assets were eliminated with the final closure of the Companys foreign subsidiary. Discontinued liabilities are related to outstanding commission due. This commission is to be paid when the final documentation of the sale of the last two lots of patents is fulfilled. As of March 31, 2013 discontinued assets and liabilities are solely related to a foreign subsidiary. Discontinued operations consists of interest income from accounts related to discontinued operations, other income, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets of discontinued operations, gains and losses on foreign exchange, as well as the reclassification of net expenses associated with our exit from our historical core operations. During fiscal 2014, we recognized $365 from the sale of the last of our NLD patents. As these assets were internally developed, there was a corresponding zero book value. The NLD revenue was offset by related expenses of $98, resulting in a net gain, net of taxes, of $267. With this sale, the Company has no other intellectual property related to discontinued operations. Discontinued operations also included expenses related to the final closing of former foreign subsidiaries. In the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company recognized a reclassification out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and into Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes. The reclassification is related to the recognition of a non-cash loss of $142 from foreign exchange differences from its former Tegal foreign subsidiaries, primarily as a result of the final closing of the former Tegal German subsidiary. The Company received permission to close the German subsidiary in June 2013. No further audits or reviews are anticipated by foreign taxing authorities. The Company also recognized a cash gain of $20 in discontinued operations as a result of final closing of bank accounts in its Italian subsidiary and a federal tax refund regarding discontinued operations. In fiscal 2013, discontinued operations included a gain resulting from the net settlement of legal expenses related to closing a foreign subsidiary for which a higher amount of legal expense had been accrued in the prior fiscal year, offset by RD expenses included in discontinued operations. 50 Table of Contents On May 7, 2012, the Company received a VAT refund related to discontinued operations in its former French subsidiary in the amount of 312 Euros. As of March 31, 2012, this amount was recognized in other assets of discontinued operations. The settlement of this outstanding amount due is classified as a reduction of assets of discontinued operations. The related foreign exchange gain was classified as a gain on the sale of discontinued operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. Total revenue from discontinued operations for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 was $0. The total income from discontinued operations, including income tax expense benefit, was $155 and $45, for the same years, respectively. Note 6. Income Taxes The deferred tax asset valuation allowance as of March 31, 2014 is attributed to U.S. federal, and state deferred tax assets, which result primarily from future deductible accruals, net operating loss carryforwards, and tax credit carryforwards. We believe that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding our ability to realize the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include our history of losses, and the lack of carryback capacity to realize deferred tax assets. In accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses or credits that we may utilize in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% as defined, over a three year period. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2014 includes no interest. As of March 31, 2014, we have no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Components of loss from continuing operations before income taxes is attributed to the following geographic locations for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 in thousands Year ended March 31 2014 2013 Domestic 3,548 4,056 Foreign Loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit 3,548 4,056 Components of income tax expense benefit for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted of the following in thousands Year ended March 31 2014 2013 Current U.S. Federal State and Local 2 Foreign credit Total current tax expense benefit 2 Deferred U.S. Federal 81 83 State and Local Foreign credit Total deferred tax expense 81 83 Total income tax expense benefit 79 83 51 Table of Contents The income tax expense benefit for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 differed from the amounts computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate as follows in thousands Year ended March 31 2014 2013 Federal tax expense benefit at U.S. Statutory Rate 1,126 1,335 State tax expense benefit net of federal tax effect 193 246 Change in valuation allowance 1,196 4,572 Tax effect of acquired net operating loss carryforwards 3,123 Foreign SubF Germany 251 Amortization of deferred tax liability 81 83 Other items 126 132 Total income tax benefit 79 83 Components of deferred taxes are as follows in thousands Year ended March 31 2014 2013 Deferred tax liability Intangible assets 500 581 Deferred tax assets Deferred revenue 48 Accruals, reserves and other 1,932 1,616 Net operating loss carryforwards 45,142 44,404 Credit carryforward 2,397 2,380 Capitalized research and development costs 299 299 Other 5 9 Gross deferred tax assets 49,323 48,127 Valuation allowance 49,323 48,127 Net deferred tax asset The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Taxes, ASC Topic 740, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of ASC Topic 740, the Company did not recognize any adjustment to the liability for uncertain tax positions and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet. As of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $14 million reduction to deferred tax assets for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which is currently offset by a full valuation allowance and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit on the balance sheet at that time. Tabular Reconciliation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits Ending Balance as ofMarch 31, 2012 833 Increase/Decrease of unrecognized tax benefits taken in prior years Increase/Decrease of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year 2 Increase/Decrease of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits related to lapsing statute of limitations 13 Ending Balance as ofMarch 31, 2013 822 Increase/Decrease of unrecognized tax benefits taken in prior years Increase/Decrease of unrecognized tax benefits related to current year 77 Increase/Decrease of unrecognized tax benefits related to settlements Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits related to lapsing statute of limitations Ending Balance as ofMarch 31, 2014 899 52 Table of Contents There are no positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within 12 months of the reporting date. Because the statute of limitations does not expire until after the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are actually used, the statues are still open on fiscal years ended March 31, 1995 forward for federal purposes, and for fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 forward for state purposes. For the years prior to March 31, 2010 for federal purposes and prior to March 31, 2009 for state purposes, any adjustments would be limited to reduction in the net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Total interest and penalties included in the statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2014 is zero. It is the Companys policy to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in tax expense. We have recorded no net deferred tax assets for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $493 million and $481millionas ofMarch 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The valuation allowance fully reserves all net operating loss carryforwards, credits and non-deductible accruals and reserves, for which realization of future benefit is uncertain. The realization of net operating losses may be limited due to change of ownership rules. The valuation allowance increased by$12 million in fiscal 2014 and increased by $48 million during fiscal 2013. As ofMarch 31, 2014, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1215 million and $652million for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. The federal net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in the year ended March 31, 2020 and the state of California began expiring as of March 31, 2013. As of March 31, 2014, the Company also has research and experimentation credit carryforwards of $14millionand$09millionfor federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. A portion of the federal credit began to expire in the year ended March 31, 2012 and the state of California will never expire under current law. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a corporation during a certain time period. In the event the Company had incurred a change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be significantly restricted Note 7. CollabRx Acquisition On July 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of CollabRx, pursuant to the previously announced Merger Agreement, dated as of June 29, 2012. As a result of the merger, CollabRx became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In consideration for 100% of the stock of CollabRx, we agreed to issue an aggregate of 236,433 shares of common stock, representing 14% of the Companys total shares outstanding prior to the closing, to former CollabRx stockholders. As of July 12, 2012, these shares had a fair value of $932. We also assumed $500 of existing CollabRx indebtedness through the issuance of promissory notes. The principal of the promissory notes is payable in equal installments on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of issuance, along with the accrued but unpaid interest as of such dates. Also the prior period note receivable balance consisted of an outstanding loan related to the Companys investment in CollabRx in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. The Companys initial investment in CollabRx was in the form of a promissory note that accrued interest at a rate of 028% per year compounded annually and matured on or about November 7, 2012. After the completion of the acquisition of CollabRx, the loan was reclassified to be included as part of the purchase price, thereby extinguishing the $300 bridge loan previously extended to CollabRx. The Company did not pay any cash consideration in connection with the acquisition. In addition, Tegal granted a total of 368,417 RSUs and options as inducement grants to newly hired management and employees, all subject to four-year vesting and other restrictions. In December 2012, an aggregate of 215,475 RSUs were forfeited in connection with the resignation of James Karis as the Companys Co-Chief Executive Officer. On July 12, 2012, in connection with the acquisition of CollabRx, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, dated June 29, 2012, we entered into an Agreement Not to Compete with Jay M. Tenenbaum the Noncompete, pursuant to which Mr. Tenenbaum agreed to refrain from competing with the Company on the terms set forth therein for a period of three years commencing on July 12, 2012. Also on July 12, 2012, we entered into a Stockholders Agreement the Stockholders Agreement with the former stockholders of CollabRx. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, i the Company has agreed to provide certain registration rights to the stockholders, and ii the stockholders have agreed to certain transfer restrictions and voting provisions for a period of two years. In connection with the Merger Agreement and the Employment Agreement dated as of June 29, 2012 by and among the Company and James Karis, on July 12, 2012, Mr. Karis, the former Chief Executive Officer of CollabRx, was appointed the Co-Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company. In December 2012, Mr. Karis resigned from his position as Co-Chief Executive Officer but remained on the Companys Board of Directors. 53 Table of Contents In addition, pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement dated as of July 12, 2012 by and between the Company and James Karis the Indemnity Agreement, Mr. Karis has been granted customary indemnification rights in connection with his position as an officer and director of the Company. Additional information is set forth in the Companys 8-K report filed on July 18, 2012, and is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The purchase price for the CollabRx acquisition was allocated as follows PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION FOR ACQUISITION OF COLLABRX Assets acquired Developed Technology 720 Customer Relationships 433 Trade Name 346 Non Compete Agreement 151 Cash 476 AP and accrueds 333 Deferred tax liability 664 Goodwill 603 Total Acquired Assets, net 1,732 Purchase Price summary Common Stock Consideration 932 Promissory Note Assumed 500 Loan/Note Payable Assumed 300 1,732 CollabRx offers cloud-based expert systems that provide clinically relevant interpretive knowledge to institutions, physicians, researchers and patients for genomics-based medicine in cancer and other diseases to inform health care decision making. With access to over 50 clinical and scientific advisors at leading academic institutions and a suite of tools and processes that combine artificial intelligence-based analytics with proprietary interpretive content, CollabRx is well positioned to participate in the $300 billion value-added big data opportunity in the US health care market as reported by McKinsey Global Institute, over half of which specifically targets areas in cancer and cancer genomics. The Company recognized $83 in tax benefit in the year ended March 31, 2014 regarding the deferred tax liability related to this acquisition. CollabRx provides this market data information so investors may understand the relevance of our estimates. We believe that overall size of the market for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics is a good indicator of the increasing importance of this market to a wide spectrum of health care providers, researchers and value-chain participants. The number of people affected by cancer, the information generated in connection with cancer research, the amount of money spent in the United States on cancer diagnostics and therapeutics are all relevant to the opportunity that we have identified. Further, we know that within these large markets, certain areas, including those that are directly addressed by CollabRx, are growing disproportionately because of advances in technology. Because the markets are emergent, and because our customers particularly those within the diagnostic laboratory segment are still developing their own diagnostic tests in oncology, we currently do not have reliable, publicly-available estimates to accurately determine the size of that particular market. It is with the recent emergence of multi-biomarker testing and multi-gene panels, to date largely performed by a single private company, that the requirement for complex integration of interpretive data has become a recognizable need. As the providers of testing platforms enable such testing at the individual laboratory level through increasingly more cost-effective technologies, and as more diagnostic labs develop their own tests based on these technologies, we believe that the market for independent interpretive analysis will expand rapidly. With regard to the market for our Therapy Finders and related products, we expect to garner some portion of the advertising budgets related to the marketing of cancer diagnostics and therapies, but we are not aware of any reliable, publicly-available estimates of market sizes for web-based tools of the type that we have developed. With regard to our GVA, while genomic testing for cancer has been performed for a number of years by academic medical centers, such testing was largely focused on single biomarkers, for which the interpretation is relatively straightforward. It is with the recent emergence of multi-biomarker testing and multi-gene panels, to date largely performed by a single private company, that the requirement for complex integration of interpretive data has become a recognizable need. As the providers of testing platforms enable such testing at the individual laboratory level through increasingly more cost-effective technologies, and as more diagnostic labs develop their own tests based on these technologies, we believe that the market for independent interpretive analysis will expand rapidly. 54 Table of Contents The physicians and researchers within our network of advisors have agreed to participate in our efforts for an indefinite term, on an uncompensated basis, and without a formal agreement On December 7, 2012, CollabRx and James M.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We estimate the fair value using a single option approach and amortize the fair value on a straight-line basis for options expected to vest. All options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. Expected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. We estimate the expected term of options granted based on our historical experience of exercises including post-vesting exercises and termination. Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of our stock options at the date of grant using historical volatilities. Historical volatilities are calculated based on the historical prices of our common stock over a period at least equal to the expected term of our option grants. Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term of our option grants. Dividends. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures. The Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. We record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. The Company does not use multiple share-based payment arrangements.

Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets;  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has conducted, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Acting Chief Financial Officer, an assessment, including testing of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2014. Managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Guidance for Smaller Public Companiesissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, Management concluded that our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2014. 60 Table of Contents Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
