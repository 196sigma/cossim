CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF
SEPTEMBER 30, 1996 AND 1995 AND FOR THE
THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996
AND INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
20 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
AG Associates, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AG Associates,
Inc. and its subsidiary the Company as of September 30, 1996 and 1995 and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 1996. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the fiscal 1994 income statement of AG Associates
Israel Ltd. a consolidated subsidiary in fiscal 1994 which statement
reflects total costs and expenses of $1,170,000 for the year ended September 30,
1994. That statement was audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for AG Associates Israel Ltd. for fiscal 1994 is based solely on the report of
such other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the auditors of AG
Associates Israel, Ltd. as described above, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
AG Associates, Inc. and its subsidiary at September 30, 1996 and 1995, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

21              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
AG Associates Israel Ltd. We have examined the balance sheet of AG Associates Israel Ltd. as of
September 30, 1993 and 1994 and the related statements of loss, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period from inception April 2,
1992 to September 30, 1992 and for the years ended September 39, 1993 and 1994
not presented separately herein. Our examinations were made in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards, including those prescribed by the Israeli
Auditors Mode of Performance Regulations, 1973, and accordingly we have
applied such auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.
In our opinion, the aforementioned financial statements present fairly, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Israel and in the
United States as applicable to the aforementioned financial statements, such
accounting principles are practically identical, the financial position of the
company at September 30, 1993 and 1994, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the period ended September 30, 1992 and for the years ended
September 30, 1993 and 1994.
Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the fact that the company
has suffered losses in considerable amounts since incorporation and is dependent
on its parent company in the United States. KESSELMAN & KESSELMAN

AG ASSOCIATES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996, 1995 AND 1994
1.  ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION - AG Associates, Inc. the Company was incorporated in
California in October 1981. The Company designs, manufactures, markets and
supports advanced single-wafer, rapid thermal processing RTP equipment
used in the manufacture of integrated circuits. The Company products,
marketed under the HeatpulseR name, utilize high intensity light to
precisely heat a single silicon wafer which results in a chemical process
needed to produce an integrated circuit. These products are manufactured
at the Company California location and sold primarily to semiconductor
manufacturers through a direct sales force in the United States and
foreign distributors.
CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements for fiscal 1996
include the accounts of AG Associates, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Rapro Technology, Inc. Rapro. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial
statements of the Company for fiscal 1995 and 1994 also include the
results of operations of AG Associates Israel Ltd. AG Israel for the
period through May 31, 1995. As a result of the sale of the controlling
interest of AG Israel see Note 13, the Company has accounted for its
remaining 49% interest in AG Israel using the equity method since June 1,
1995.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist primarily of
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as accounts
receivable. The Company has placed the majority of its cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments with high-quality financial
institutions.
The Company sells its products primarily to large companies in the
semiconductor industry. Credit risk is further mitigated by the Company
credit evaluation process. The Company does not require collateral or
other security to support receivables. While the Company maintains
allowances for potential credit losses, actual bad debt losses to date
have not been material.
FINANCIAL STATEMENT ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates
include the level of the allowance for potentially uncollectible
receivables; inventory reserves for obsolete, slow moving or nonsalable
inventory, certain accruals and estimated costs for installation, warranty
and other customer support obligations. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS - Cash equivalents are highly liquid debt investments
acquired with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase.
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS - The Company has classified its short-term
corporate debt securities and its adjustable rate preferred stock
investments as available for sale securities, and the carrying value of
these securities is fair market value, as determined by quoted market
prices. Net unrealized losses on these investments have been recorded as a
separate component of shareholders' equity, net of related tax.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market. The Company reviews the levels of its inventories in
light of current and forecasted demand to identify and provide reserves
for obsolete, slow-moving, or nonsalable inventory. -8-
28
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over estimated
useful lives of three to five years. Equipment under capital lease and
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or the lease term.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - All research and development costs are expensed
as incurred. The Company products include certain software applications
which are integral to the operation of the product. The costs to develop
such software have not been capitalized as the Company believes its
current software development process is essentially completed concurrent
with the establishment of the technological feasibility of the software
and/or development of the related hardware.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - Sales are generally recognized upon shipment.
Estimated costs for installation, warranty and other customer support
obligations which are considered insignificant, are accrued in the period
that sales are recognized. Services outside the warranty period are
generally provided to customers on a time and materials basis, and are
recognized when the services are performed.
INCOME TAXES - The Company provides for income taxes using the asset and
liability approach defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109 SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
NET INCOME PER SHARE - Net income per share is based upon the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares common
stock options, warrants and securities convertible into the Company
common stock outstanding. Net income for fiscal 1994 is adjusted for the
interest on convertible debentures assumed converted.

8.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
Upon consummation of the Company initial public offering in May 1995,
all Series A convertible preferred stock was automatically converted into
7,813 shares of common stock.
COMMON STOCK
In May 1995, the Company completed an initial public offering of 2,070,000
shares of common stock, including the underwriter overallotment of
270,000 shares, resulting in total proceeds to the Company of $20,232,000,
net of issuance costs.
During fiscal 1993, the Company issued $2,000,000 in convertible
subordinated debentures the Debentures to the Investment Company of Bank
of Hapoalim Ltd. Hapoalim Investment Co. In May 1995, at the election
of Hapoalim Investment Co. and upon consummation of the Company initial
public offering, principal on the Debentures was converted into 271,739
shares of the Company voting common stock at a price of $736 per share. -11-
31
In addition, Hapoalim Investment Co. had a warrant to purchase 173,750
shares of the Company common stock. In connection with the public
offering in May 1995, the warrant was exercised, resulting in proceeds to
the Company of $1,529,000.
NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM SHAREHOLDERS
Certain notes had been received from officers for the acquisition of
shares of common stock. All notes were canceled as of September 30, 1996.
STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS
Under the Company stock option plans the Plans, 1,500,000 shares of
Common Stock are reserved for the grant of incentive or nonstatutory stock
options and the direct award or sale of shares to employees, directors,
contractors and consultants. Under the Plans, options are granted at fair
value at the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors.
Generally, such options become exercisable over periods of one to four
years and expire ten years from the grant date.
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. The new standard defines a fair value method of accounting
for stock options and other equity instruments, such as stock purchase
plans. Under this method, compensation cost is measured based on the fair
value of the stock award when granted and is recognized as an expense over
the service period, which is usually the vesting period. This standard
will be effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 1997 and requires
measurement of awards made beginning in fiscal 1996.
The new standard permits companies to continue to account for equity
transactions with employees under existing accounting rules, but requires
disclosure in a note to the financial statements of the pro forma effect
of net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the new
method of accounting. The Company intends to implement these disclosure
requirements for its stock option plans. As a result, for options issued
to employees, adoption of the new standard will not impact reported
earnings or earnings per share, and will have no effect on the Company
cash flows. -12-

Option activity under the Plans was as follows                     NUMBER       OPTION PRICE

At September 30, 1996, the weighted average exercise price of outstanding
options was $644. In addition, 229,979 options were exercisable and
637,674 options were available for future grant.
As of September 30, 1996 and 1995, nonqualified options to purchase 74,934
and 4,375 shares, respectively, were outstanding to consultants and
directors at prices ranging from $360 to $1671.
In June 1996, the Company canceled options to purchase 495,439 shares of
common stock exercisable at $738 to $3319 per share and issued
replacement options with an exercise price of $721 per share.
In May 1994, the Company canceled options to purchase 86,875 shares of
common stock exercisable at $480 to $740 per share and issued
replacement options with an exercise price of $400 per share.
In connection with certain grants of certain stock options to employees in
fiscal 1994, the Company had recorded $230,000 for the difference between
the deemed fair value for accounting purposes and the option price as
determined by the Board at the date of grant. Of such amount, $102,000
related to option grants which had previously vested and accordingly were
expensed in fiscal 1994; the remaining $128,000 is presented as a
reduction of shareholders' equity and is being amortized over the 48-month
vesting period of the related stock options. Amortization of deferred
stock compensation for 1996 and 1995 was $64,000 and $47,000,
respectively.
In November 1994, the Company reserved 50,000 shares for a directors stock
option plan. Options to exercise 6,000 shares at prices ranging from $914
to $1750 have been issued under this plan at September 30, 1996.
In November 1994, the Company reserved 250,000 shares for sale under the
1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, designed to qualify under Internal
Revenue Code Section 423b. Stock may be offered for purchase by
employees at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the market value of the
stock at the beginning or end of each six-month offer period, subject to
annual limitation. In fiscal 1996, 52,694 shares were issued under this
Plan for net proceeds to the Company of $310,000. No shares had been
issued under this Plan in fiscal 1995. -13-

Realization of the tax benefit related to the Company deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.
Management has determined that recognition of its deferred tax assets is
considered more likely than not at September 30, 1996, and therefore, has
provided no valuation allowance. The valuation allowance at September 30,
1995 of $1,476,000, which related to amounts arising from Rapro
preacquisition carryforwards, was reduced to $1,408,000 in 1996 due to
utilization of $68,000 of these carryforwards. The credit carryforwards
expire in 2006.
10.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
The Company has a 401k tax-deferred savings plan under which

contributed to the Plan to date.

13.  AG ISRAEL
In 1992, the Company established AG Israel for the purpose of developing,
manufacturing and marketing platforms for moving and controlling silicon
wafers for the semiconductor industry. During fiscal 1993, the Company
sold an approximate 499% interest in AG Israel to Hapoalim Investment Co.
and Yozma Venture Capital Yozma. The Company retained a 501% voting
interest. Hapoalim Investment Co. and Yozma had the right to convert all
of their interests in AG Israel to shares of the Company common stock.
Accordingly, the Company had recognized 100% of AG Israel losses since
its inception. -16-
36
In April 1994, the Company obtained the right to induce conversion of this
minority interest at any time. In return, Hapoalim Investment Co.
purchased the shares held by Yozma and the Company revised the exchange
rate at which Hapoalim Investment Co. could exchange its interest in AG
Israel from $920 to $736 per share, and also revised the conversion rate
of the debentures from $920 to $736. The Company also modified the terms
of the warrant held by Hapoalim Investment Co., decreasing the exercise
price to the lower of $915 or 80% of the price of the shares in an
initial public offering. The fair value at April 1994 of these revisions
to the exchange rate, conversion rate and warrant price were estimated to
be $400,000 and was included in other expense.
In February 1995, the Company exercised its exchange right and issued
271,739 shares of common stock to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
AG Israel. Also, in February 1995, the Company entered into an agreement
for the sale of the controlling interest in the research, development and
other business operations of its Rapro and AG Israel operations. Under the
agreement, effective upon the close of the Company initial public
offering in May 1995, the Company contributed rights to the chemical vapor
deposition CVD and cluster tool technologies, certain assets and
liabilities of Rapro and cash of $500,000 to AG Israel. AG Israel issued
stock equal to a 51% interest to Clal Electronics Industries Ltd. Clal
Electronics in exchange for $2,500,000. In addition, Clal Electronics had
agreed to permit reimbursement to the Company for advances made to AG
Israel subsequent to September 30, 1994 through the closing of this
transaction in May 1995; such reimbursements totaled $521,000. AG Israel
is devoting its principal efforts to the development of cluster tools
using the technologies received from the Company; the Company and Clal
Electronics paid AG Israel an additional $1,000,000 and $2,000,000,
respectively, under the agreement. The Company has a right for a five-year
period to repurchase Clal Electronics interest in AG Israel and to
terminate the joint ownership of the technology for a repurchase price
equal to 100% of amounts contributed to AG Israel by Clal Electronics plus
simple interest at 25% of such contributions for each year from the date
the contribution was made, plus, under certain circumstances, $500,000.
The Company also entered into a voting agreement with Clal Electronics
that covers, among other items, rights to elect directors of AG Israel and
rights of each of the parties to acquire additional shares of AG Israel.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Clal Electronics acquired
approximately 544,000 shares 99% of the Company outstanding shares of
common stock from existing shareholders of the Company. After three years,
Clal Electronics may increase its ownership in the Company up to 12% and,
if its ownership exceeds 10%, Clal Electronics has the right to nominate a
member for election to the Company Board of Directors.
As a result of AG Israel stock sale, the Company has accounted for its
49% investment in AG Israel using the equity method since June 1, 1995.
Results of operations of AG Israel and Rapro prior to June 1, 1995 have
been included in the consolidated statement of operations. These
operations had combined net sales of $339,000 and $1,124,000 and a net
