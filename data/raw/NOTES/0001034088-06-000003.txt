Report
of Independent
Registered Public Certified Accounting Firm
To the Board
of
Directors and Stockholders of Eclipsys Corporation:
We
have completed integrated audits of Eclipsys Corporations 2005 and
2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on
our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated
financial statements and financial statement
schedule
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Eclipsys Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2005
and
2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedulebased on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal
control over financial reporting
Also,
in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Report of
Management on Eclipsys Corporations Internal Control over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated,
in
all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion,
the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinions. 
A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of
the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Organization and Description of Business
Eclipsys
Corporation Eclipsys or the Company, We,
Us or Our is a healthcare information technology company and a leading
provider of advanced clinical, financial and management information software
and
service solutions. The Company develops and licenses proprietary software
and content that is designed to help automate many of the key clinical,
administrative and financial functions that hospitals and other healthcare
organizations require. The Companys software is designed to enable
clients to improve patient care and patient satisfaction, reduce operating
costs, and enhance revenues. Among other things, the software enables
physicians, nurses and other clinicians to check on a patients condition, order
patient tests, review test results, monitor a patients medications, and provide
alerts to changes in a patients condition. The software also facilitates
hospitals patient admissions, scheduling, records maintenance, invoicing,
inventory control, cost accounting, and helps clients determine the
profitability of physicians and physician groups, understand the profitability
of specific medical procedures, and perform numerous other functions. The
Companys content, which is integrated with our software, provides treatment
guidelines in context at the point of care for use by physicians, nurses
and
other clinicians. 
2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles
of
Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Eclipsys Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Eclipsys
manages its business as one reportable segment.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions used
in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements are based upon managements
evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances as of the date of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most
significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts, revenues
recognized, the amounts recorded for capitalized software development costs,
amortization periods, the warranty reserve and the valuation allowance
for
deferred tax assets.
Reclassifications
Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 2005 presentation. These reclassifications have had no impact
on
the statement of operations, net income or the statement of cash
flows.
Cash
and Cash Equivalents
For
purposes of the consolidated statements of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Revenue
Recognition
Revenues
are derived
from licensing of computer software; software and hardware maintenance;
professional services including implementation, integration, training
and
consulting; remote hosting; outsourcing; network services; and the sale
of
computer hardware.
We
generally contract
under multiple element arrangements, which include software license fees,
hardware and services including consulting, implementation, and software
maintenance, for periods of 3 to 10 years. We evaluate revenue recognition
on a
contract-by-contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary. The evaluation
of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates
that
affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations.
Specifically, we may be required to make judgments about:
whether
the fees associated with our software and
services are fixed or determinable;
whether
collection of our fees is reasonably assured;
whether
professional services are essential to the
functionality of the related software;
whether
we have the ability to make reasonably
dependable estimates in the application of the percentage-of-completion
method; and
whether
we have verifiable objective evidence of fair
value for our software and services.
We
recognize
revenues in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position SOP
No.
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98-9, Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB 104, Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. SOP 97-2
and SAB 104 require among other matters, that there be a signed contract
evidencing an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed
or
determinable, and collectibility is probable. 
Many
of our
contracts with our clients are multiple element arrangements which may
provide
for multiple software modules including the rights to future versions and
releases we may offer within the software suites the client purchases or
rights
to software versions that support different hardware or operating platforms,
and
that do not qualify as exchange rights. We refer to these arrangements as
subscription contracts. Additionally, we sometimes enter into multiple
element arrangements that do not include these rights to future software
or
platform protection rights. We refer to these arrangements as traditional
software contracts. Finally, we offer much of our software and services on
a stand-alone basis. Revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized
as
follows:
33
Table
of Contents
Subscription
Contracts
Our
subscription contracts typically include the
following deliverables:
Software license fees;
Maintenance;
Professional services; and
Third party hardware or remote hosting services
Software
license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing
upon the delivery of the software provided that 1there is evidence of an
arrangement, 2the fee is fixed or determinable and 3collection
of our fee is considered probable. The value of the software is determined
using
the residual method pursuant to SOP98-9, Modification of SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions. These
contracts contain the rights to unspecified future software within the
suite
purchased and/or unspecified platform transfer rights that do not qualify
for
exchange accounting. Accordingly, these arrangements are accounted for
pursuant
to paragraphs48 and 49 of SOP97-2. Under certain arrangements, we
capitalize related direct costs consisting of third party software costs
and
direct software implementation costs. These costs are amortized over the
term of
the arrangement.
In
the case of maintenance revenues, vendor-specific
objective evidence VSOE of fair value is based on substantive renewal
prices,
and the revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance
period.
In
the case of professional services revenues, VSOE is
based on prices from stand-alone sale transactions, and the revenues are
recognized as services are performed pursuant to paragraph65 and 66 of
SOP97-2.
Third
party hardware revenues are recognized upon
delivery, pursuant to SAB104.
For
remote hosting services, where VSOE is based upon
consistent pricing charged to clients based on volumes and performance
requirements on a stand-alone basis and substantive renewal terms, revenues
are
recognized ratably over the contract term as the services are performed.
Our
remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one-time set-up
activities and include a one-time set-up fee. This one-time set-up fee
is
generally paid by the client at contract execution. We have determined
that
these set-up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting,
and
accordingly the related set-up fees are recognized ratably over the term
of the
contract.
We
consider the applicability of EITF00-3,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored On Another
Entitys Hardware, to our remote hosting services arrangements on a
contract-by-contract basis. If we determine that the client has the contractual
right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting
period
without significant penalty, and can feasibly run the software on its own
hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the
software, a software element covered by SOP97-2 exists. When a software
element exists in a remote hosting services arrangement, we recognize the
license, professional services and remote hosting services revenues pursuant
to
SOP97-2, whereby the fair value of the remote hosting service is
recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract.
If
we determine that a software element covered by SOP97-2 is not present in
a remote hosting services arrangement; we recognize revenue for the remote
hosting services arrangement ratably over the term of the remote hosting
contract pursuant to SAB104.
Traditional
Software Contracts
We
enter into traditional multiple-element arrangements
that include the following elements:
Software license;
Maintenance;
Professional services; and
Third party hardware or remote hosting services
Revenue
for
each of the elements is recognized as follows:
Software
license fees are recognized upon delivery of
the software provided that 1there is evidence of an arrangement,
2the fee is fixed or determinable and 3collection of our fee is
considered probable. For those arrangements in which the fee is not considered
fixed or determinable, the software license revenue is recognized as the
payments become due. For arrangements where VSOE only exists for the undelivered
elements, we account for the delivered elements software license revenue
using
the residual method in accordance with SOP98-9.
34
Table
of Contents
In
addition to the software license fees, these
contracts may also contain maintenance, professional services and hardware
or
remote hosting services. VSOE and revenue recognition for these elements
is
determined using the same methodology as noted above for subscription
contracts.
Software
Contracts Requiring Contract
Accounting
We
enter into certain multiple element arrangements
containing milestone provisions in which the professional services are
considered essential to the functionality of the software. Under these
arrangements, software license fees and professional service revenues are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method over the implementation
period which generally ranges from 12 to 24months. Under the
percentage-of-completion method, revenue and profit are recognized throughout
the term of the implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours
incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the implementation.
Changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the
timing
of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are
determinable. Accordingly, changes in these estimates could occur and have
a
material effect on our operating results in the period of change.
Stand-Alone
Software and Services
We
also market certain software and services on a
stand-alone basis, including the following:
Outsourcing;
Software license;
Maintenance;
Professional services;
Hardware;
Network services;
Remote Hosting services
Revenue
related to such software and services are recognized as follows:
Software
license fees and maintenance are marketed on a
stand-alone basis may be licensed either under traditional contracts or
under
subscription arrangements. Software license fees under traditional contracts
are
recognized pursuant to SOP97-2 when the following criteria are met;
delivery of the software has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable.
Under
subscription agreements for stand-alone software, license fees are recognized
ratably over the term of the contract. With respect to maintenance, VSOE
is
determined based on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts.
Maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
Professional
services represent incremental services
marketed to clients including implementation and consulting services.
Professional services revenues, where VSOE is based on prices from stand-alone
transactions are recognized as services are performed.
Hardware
is recognized upon delivery pursuant to
SAB104.
Network
service arrangements include the assessment,
assembly and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless
carts or
other wireless equipment to the client. Our network services arrangements
are
sold to a client for a fixed fee. All services are performed prior to the
delivery of the equipment. These contracts are typically 60 to 90days in
length and are recognized pursuant to SAB104, upon the delivery of the
network to the client.
Remote
hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone
basis are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to SAB104.
Our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one-time
set-up
activities and include a one-time set-up fee. This one-time set-up fee
is
generally paid by the client at contract execution. We have determined
that
these set-up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting,
and
accordingly we recognize the related set-up fees ratably over the term
of the
contract.
We
provide outsourcing services to our clients. Under
these arrangements we assume all responsibilities for a healthcare
organizations IT operations using our employees. Our outsourcing services
include facilities management, network outsourcing and transition management.
These arrangements typically range from five to ten years in duration.
Revenues
from these arrangements are recognized when services are performed.
The
Company records reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses
in both systems and services revenues and as a direct cost of systems and
services revenues in accordance with EITF Issue No. 01-14, Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
Incurred EITF 01-14. EITF 01-14 requires reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred to be characterized as revenue in the income
statement. For 2005, 2004, and 2003 reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses
were
$92 million, $57 million, and $45 million, respectively. 
In
accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-10, Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Fees, the Company has classified the
re-imbursement by clients of shipping and handling costs as revenue and
the
associated cost as cost of revenue. 
If
other judgments or assumptions were used in the
evaluation of our revenue arrangements, the timing and amounts of revenue
recognized may have been significantly different.

Warranty
Reserve
The
license agreements for our software generally
include a limited warranty providing that our software, in its unaltered
form,
will perform substantially in accordance with the related documentation.
Through
September 30, 2003, we had not incurred any material warranty costs related
to
our software. As a result of the response time issues identified during
the
fourth quarter of 2003, we recorded a warranty reserve of $46 million
through
December 31, 2004. No additional warranty reserve was recorded during the
year
ended December 31, 2005, as management considers the warranty reserve previously
recorded to be adequate to cover all potential claims as currently foreseen.
Warranty costs are charged to costs of systems and services revenues when
they
are probable and reasonably estimable. A summary of the activity in our

As
of December 31, 2005, all marketable securities,
except for auction rate securities, have a maturity of less than 2years.
Auction rate securities of $312 million held at December 31, 2005 have
an
underlying maturity of greater than ten years, but typically have an interest
rate reset feature every 30days pursuant to which we can sell or reset the
interest rate on the security. At December 31, 2005, we believe that these
investments are considered a part our working capital and are appropriately
classified as current assets.
In
an effort to increase our interest income, we moved
excess cash from money market investment to marketable securities, which
include
auction rates securities and government bonds. These funds remain highly
liquid.

Accounts Receivable
and
Unbilled Receivables
The
timing of
revenue recognition and contractual billing terms under certain multiple
element
arrangements may not precisely coincide, resulting in the recording of
unbilled
accounts receivable or deferred revenue. Client payments are due under
these arrangements in varying amounts upon the achievement of certain
contractual milestones throughout the implementation periods, which generally
range from 12 to 24 months. The current portion of unbilled accounts
receivable is included in accounts receivable.

for Doubtful Accounts
In
evaluating the collectibility of our accounts
receivable, we assess a number of factors, including a specific clients ability
to meet its financial obligations to us, as well as general factors, such
as the
length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection
experience. Based on these assessments, we record a reserve for specific
account
balances as well as a reserve based on our historical experience for bad
debt to
reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect
from clients. If circumstances related to specific clients change, or economic
conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer
relevant, our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable
could be
further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial
statements.
Inventory
Inventory
consists of computer equipment, parts and
peripherals and is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out method.
Capitalized
Software Development
Costs
We
capitalize a portion of our computer software
development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility.
These costs include salaries, benefits, consulting and other directly related
costs incurred in connection with programming and testing software.
Capitalization ceases when the software is generally released for sale
to
clients. Management monitors the net realizable value of development costs
to
ensure that the investment will be recovered through future revenues.
Capitalized software development costs were approximately $201 million,
$152million and $182million for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. These costs are amortized over the
greater
of the ratio that current revenues are to total and anticipated future
revenues
for the applicable software or the straight-line method over three years.
Amortization of capitalized software development costs, which is included
in
costs of systems and services revenues, was approximately $143 million,
$106million and $82million for the years ended December31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized
software development costs was $195 million and $176million as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005 and 2004 respectively, we
wrote-off fully amortized capitalized software development costs in the
amount
of $123 million and $216million.
Acquired
Technology and Intangible Assets
Acquired
technology and intangible assets are amortized
over their estimated useful lives generally on a straight-line basis. The
carrying values of acquired technology and intangible assets are reviewed
if the
facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired and goodwill
is
reviewed annually in accordance with Statement of Financial 
37
Table
of Contents
Accounting Standards , SFAS No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets. Testing would be done on a more frequent basis, if
impairment indicators arise. The test for impairment is based upon a number
of
factors, including operating results, business plans and projected future cash
flows. No impairment has been identified or recorded during fiscal 2005 or
2004.

Long
Lived Assets
Long
lived assets including separate and
identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for potential impairment at such
time when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset might not be recoverable. Any impairment loss would be recognized
when the sum of the expected, undiscounted net cash flows is less than the
carrying amount of the asset. If an asset is impaired, the asset is written
down
to its estimated fair value. 
Fair
Value of Financial
Instruments
The
carrying amounts of our financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and other current
liabilities, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets
and liabilities. 
Income
Taxes
The
provision for income taxes and corresponding balance
sheet accounts are determined in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes SFAS No109. Under SFAS No109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between
the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial
reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified
according to the financial statement classification of the assets and
liabilities generating the differences. The Company provides a valuation
allowance for that portion of deferred tax assets, which it cannot determine
is
more likely than not to be recognized due to the Companys cumulative losses and
the uncertainty as to future recoverability.

Stock-Based
Compensation
For
all historical periods presented, we account for
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion, APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under this method,
compensation costs for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of
the
estimated market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount
an
employee must pay to acquire the stock. Accordingly, we provide the additional
disclosures required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation as amended by SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure. We have issued restricted
common stock to key employees at nominal prices. We record unearned stock
compensation for such items and recognize stock compensation expense ratably
over the vesting period of the restricted common stock agreements.
We
have adopted the disclosure only provision of SFAS
123. If compensation costs for our stock option grants described above were
determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 2005, 2004
and 2003, consistent with the provisions of SFAS 123, Eclipsys net income /

The
fair value of each option grant is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2005, 2004, and 2003: dividend
yield of 0% for all years, risk-free interest rate of 411% for 2005, of
330% for 2004 and 263% for 2003; expected life of 631 years for 2005, 492
years for 2004and 488 years for 2003, based on the plan and volatility of
79% for 2005, 84% for 2004 and 92% for 2003.
Basic
and Diluted Net Income Loss Per
Share
For
all periods presented, basic and diluted net income
loss per common share is presented in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings per
Share, which provides for the accounting principles used in the calculation of
earnings per share. Basic net income loss per common share excludes dilution
and is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by
the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution from assumed
conversion of all dilutive securities such as stock options, warrants and
unvested restricted stock using the treasury stock method. When the
effects of the outstanding stock options or warrants are anti-dilutive, they
are
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share. For the
year ended December31, 2005, anti-dilutive stock options totaling
1,299,143 were excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per common
share. The computation of the basic and diluted earnings per common share

Concentration
of Credit
Risk
Our
clients operate primarily in the healthcare
industry. We sell our software and services under contracts with varying terms.
The accounts receivable amounts are unsecured. We believe that the allowance
for
doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover credit losses. We do not believe that
the loss of any one client would have a material effect on our financial
position.
Foreign
Currency
Our
financial position and results of operations of
foreign subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the respective countries
as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the foreign
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses
for the year are translated at the average exchange rate in effect during the
year. Translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income
or
loss but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders
equity. We have not entered into any hedging contracts during the three-year
period ended December 31, 2005.
Comprehensive
Income
Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income requires that the total changes in equity
resulting from revenue, expenses, and gains and losses, including those that
do
not affect the accumulated deficit, be reported. Accordingly, those amounts,
which are comprised solely of foreign currency translation adjustments, are
included in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of changes
in stockholders equity.
New
Accounting
Pronouncements
In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS or Statement
No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary AssetsAn Amendment of Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions SFAS No153. SFAS No153 eliminates the exception
from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
assets in paragraph 21b of APB Opinion No29 and replaces it with an
exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No153
specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if future cash
flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange. SFAS No153 was effective for the Company beginning on
July1, 2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did not have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial position.
In
April
2005, the SEC announced that the effective date of SFAS No123R,
Share-Based Payments, has been deferred for certain public companies. SFAS
No123R, as amended, requires that all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee equity incentives, are to be recognized in the
consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values. SFAS
No123R will be applicable to the Company beginning January1, 2006,
and the Company intends to adopt the standard using the modified prospective
method. The modified prospective method requires compensation costs to be
recognized, beginning with the effective date of adoption, for a all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and b awards granted
to
employees prior to the effective date of the statement that remain unvested
on
the effective date. 
As
permitted
by SFAS No123 we account for share-based payments to employees
using the intrinsic value method prescribed in APB No25 Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and as such, generally recognize no compensation
cost for employee equity incentives. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS
No123R will have a significant impact on the Companys results of
operations, although it will have no impact on our overall liquidity. The
impact
of the adoption of SFAS No123R can not be determined at this time because
it will depend on the levels of share-based payments granted in the future.
However, had the Company adopted SFAS No123R in prior periods, the impact
of the statement would have approximated the impact of SFAS No123 as
described in the disclosure of pro-forma net income loss and earnings
loss
per share included in the stock-based compensation table in Note 2 - Basic
and
Diluted Net Income Loss Per Share. 
SFAS
No123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather
than as an operating cash flow as required under current requirements. This
requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing
cash
flows in periods after adoption.
In
May
2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Corrections
which replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes and SFAS
No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in
accounting principle. SFAS No154 also provides guidance on the accounting
for and reporting of error corrections. This statement is applicable for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning
after December15, 2005.

Property and Equipment
Property
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided
for
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which generally
range from 2 to 7 years. Computer equipment is depreciated over 2 to 5 years.
Office equipment is depreciated over2 to7 years. Purchased software
for internal use is amortized over 3 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of
the
lease. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related costs
and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain
or
loss is reflected in income. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance not
considered to substantially lengthen the property and equipment lives are
charged to expense as incurred. The balances for property and equipment were

Stockholders Equity
Restricted
Stock Grant
From
time to time the Company has issued restricted
stock grants to members of senior management. The Company issued 372,500
and 295,000 shares in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Generally, restricted
stock grants vest over a five-year period.
Stock
compensation related to all restricted stock
issued amounted to $24 million in 2005, $428,000 in 2004 and $225,000 in 2003.
As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, Eclipsys had unearned stock
compensation of $96 million and $56 million recorded as a component of
stockholders equity. Additionally, during 2004, the Company accelerated
vesting of certain stock options and recorded stock-based compensation expense
of $49,000. 
Undesignated

the Undesignated Preferred will be determined by the Board of Directors at
the
time of issuance. Currently, there are no outstanding preferred
shares.

dividend of one Right for each outstanding share of Eclipsys Common Stock to
stockholders of record at the close of business on August 9, 2000. Each Right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from Eclipsys one one-thousandth
of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $01 par value per
share, at a Purchase Price of $6500 in cash, subject to adjustment. The Rights
will initially trade together with Eclipsys Common Stock, and will not be

At
December 31, 2005, the Company had U.S. net operating
loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $3065
million. Of this amount, $60 million expires in 2012 with the balance
expiring in varying amounts annually through 2025. Of the $3065 million
total, $633 million relate to stock option tax deductions which will be
tax-effected and the benefit credited as additional paid-in-capital when
realized. Additionally, the Company has Canadian net operating loss
carryovers of approximately $191 million that expire in varying amounts through
2012.
Under
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of, and
the benefits from, net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited
in certain circumstances. We experienced an ownership change as defined under
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in November 1998. As a result of the
ownership change, net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $169
million at November 1998, which were incurred prior to the date of the change,
are subject to annual limitations on their future use. As of December 31, 2005,
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $47 million remain subject
to
the annual limitation. As of December 31, 2005, a valuation allowance has been
established against the deferred tax assets that management does not believe
are
more likely than not to be realized.

Employee
Savings Plan
During
1997, we established a Savings Plan the Plan
pursuant to Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Code, whereby
employees may contribute a percentage of their compensation, not to exceed
the
maximum amount allowable under the Code. At the discretion of our Board of
Directors, we may elect to make matching contributions, as defined in the Plan.

Stock. The purchase price of such shares is the lower of 85% of the fair market
value of the Common Stock on the day the offering commences and 85% of the
fair
market value of the Common Stock on the day the offering terminates.
During the second quarter of 2004, we suspended the Purchase Plan
indefinitely.
2005
Employee Stock Purchase
Plan
On

In
aggregate, these obligations total approximately $484 million. These
obligations will require payments of approximately $377million in 2006,
with the majority of the balance occurring within the next three
years.
Employment
Agreements
The
Company has entered into employment agreements with
certain key employees. These agreements provide for severance and other
benefits if the Company, for any other reason than cause, as defined by their
agreements, terminates these employees.
Indemnification
clauses
Our
standard software license agreements contain
indemnification clauses that are limited in amount. Pursuant to these clauses,
we indemnify, hold harmless, and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for
losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. We account for these
clauses under FASB Staff Position FIN 45 45-1: Accounting for Intellectual
Property Infringement Indemnifications under FASB Interpretation No. 45.
Accordingly, there are no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of
December 31, 2005.
8.
Acquisitions
In
March 2004, we acquired CPM Resource Center, Ltd., or
CPMRC. CPMRC provides consulting services and clinical content designed
principally to improve and enhance the care process primarily related to the
workflow of nurses and interdisciplinary healthcare professionals. CPMRCs
evidence-based content and practice guidelines has been incorporated into our
current releases of SunriseXA software. We paid $25million in cash and
issued 184,202shares of common stock for CPMRC, for a total consideration
of $50million. In addition, the acquisition agreement permitted the prior
owner of CPMRC to earn up to an additional $125million over the following
5year period based on future operating results, payable 50% in shares of
our common stock and 50% in cash, based upon the average of the last reported
sale prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ National Market for the five
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is one day prior to
the
date on which the earn-out consideration is paid. The operating results of
CPMRC
have been combined with those of the Eclipsys since the date of acquisition.
We
did not present unaudited pro forma results of operations of Eclipsys and CPMRC
for the year ended December31, 2004 and 2003 because our pro forma results
for those periods would not be materially different from our actual results
for
those periods.

Table
of Contents
At
the time of the CPMRC acquisition, we recorded
approximately $24million in non amortizable goodwill and
$32million in amortizable intangible assets. Amortizable intangible
assets include client relationships and acquired technology and is being
amortized over a seven and five year period, respectively, which we believe
approximates the expected utility of these assets. The non amortizable goodwill
is not tax deductible. Since the date of the CPMRC acquisition we have recorded
incremental non amortizable goodwill related to consideration earned by the
prior owner as part of the earn-out provisions of the agreement. These
amounts were approximately $15 million in 2005 and $700,000 in 2004. All
consideration paid under the earn out provisions of the agreement will be
recorded as non amortizable goodwill. In 2005, for amounts related to the
2004 earn-out attainment, we issued 25,311 shares of our common stock.
In
December of 2004, we acquired eSys Medical Inc.
eSys. eSys develops and markets radiology information systems RIS. Using
our
solutions, clinicians will be able to view patient medical records, diagnostic
images and reports in real time. We believe the acquisition will increase
sales
opportunities for our Picture Archiving Communications System PACSand
RIS systems through integration with both our and other clinical systems.
In
2004, we paid $23million in cash consideration for the eSys acquisition.
In addition, the terms of the acquisition agreement permitted the prior owners
of eSys to earn up to an additional $25million of future consideration
related to certain milestones in connection with future development of the
acquired technology, payable in cash 25% and our common stock 75%.
Additionally, the agreement contains an earn out provision permitting the
prior
owners to earn up to an additional $50million in future consideration
based on sales of the acquired technology over the five years following the
closing of the transaction, payable in cash or shares of our common stock.
The
number of shares of our common stock issued as earn-out consideration will
be
based on the average closing prices of our common stock on the NASDAQ National
Market for the calendar quarter preceding the payment of the earn-out
consideration.
As
a result of the eSys acquisition, we recorded
approximately $20million in amortizable intangible assets. Amortizable
intangible assets include client relationships of $11million and acquired
technology of $914,000 and is being amortized over a five and three year period,
respectively. We believe these amortization periods reflect the estimated
expected utility of these assets. The operating results of eSys have been
combined with those of Eclipsys since the date of acquisition. We did not
present unaudited pro forma results of operations of Eclipsys and eSys for
the
year ended December31, 2004 and 2003 because our pro forma results for
those periods would not be materially different from our actual results for
those periods. The majority of future consideration, if earned, will be recorded
as non amortizable goodwill.
In
2005, under the provisions of the earn-out agreement,
we recorded incremental non amortizable goodwill of approximately $22
million. In connection with the earn-out agreement, we issued 40,612
shares of our common stock in 2005 for amounts earned, and paid cash
consideration totaling approximately $311,000.
With
respect to the acquisitions of CPMRC and eSys, we
assigned the total purchase price to the net assets and liabilities of the
businesses with any remaining amount assigned to goodwill. The value assigned
to
the identifiable intangible assets was based on an analysis as of the date
of
acquisitions.

Litigation
The
Company and its subsidiaries are from time to time
parties to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims incident to their
business activities. Such matters may include, among other things, assertions
of
contract breach or intellectual property infringement, claims for indemnity
arising in the course of our business and claims by persons whose employment
with us has been terminated. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties
and
outcomes are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, management is unable
to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability, amounts which
may be covered by insurance or recoverable from third parties, or the financial
impact with respect to these matters as of the date of this report. However,
based on our knowledge at the time of this report, management believes that
the
final resolution of such matters pending at the time of this report,
individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect
upon
our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Related
Party
Transactions
We
have certain transactions between us and our
executive officers, directors and affiliates.
We
lease office space in Boston, Massachusetts from a
former stockholder of SDK Medical Computer Services Corporation, or SDK, and
lease office space in Grand Rapids, Michigan from the former stockholder of
CPMRC. SDK was acquired in 1997. During the years ended December31, 2005,

the
Boston lease. Under the Michigan lease we paid $72,000 in 2005 and
$42,000 in 2004. The leases are non-cancelable and expire in 2009 and 2008
respectively.
Our
former Chairman Emeritus, Harvey J. Wilson, owns a
company, RMSC of West Palm Beach Inc. RMSC, which leases an aircraft to a
charter company. The charter company provides aircraft charter services to
us as
well as other outside parties. Mr.Wilson has no ownership or other
interest in the charter company. We paid the charter company $269,000, $733,000
and $603,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for charters using the
aircraft owned by RMSC. We also paid the charter company $163,000, $74,000
and
$50,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for charters of other aircraft,
not owned by RMSC. RMSC received $145,000, $408,000 and $275,000 during 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, from the charter company for these transactions.
In January 2006, the Company entered into an arrangement whereby the
remaining commitment of $544,000 will be utilized during the first half of
2006. Additionally, under this agreement the Company and Chairman Emeritus
terminated the arrangement pursuant to which Mr. Wilson served as Chairman

In
July 1999, we invested in HEALTHvision, Inc.
HEALTHvision, a Dallas-based, privately held internet healthcare company.
Other principal investors included VHA, Inc. and investment entities affiliated
with General Atlantic, LLC. HEALTHvision provides Internet solutions to hospital
organizations to assist them in improving patient care in the local communities
they serve. We purchased 3,400,000shares of common stock in HEALTHvision
for $34,000, which at the time represented 34% of the outstanding common stock
on an if-converted basis. As of December31, 2005, our shares represented
approximately 28% of the common stock of HEALTHvision on an if-converted basis.
We account for our investment in HEALTHvision using the equity method of
accounting. Due to losses recognized under the equity method, the recorded
balance of the investment in HEALTHvision was $0 as of December31, 2005.
We entered into a joint marketing arrangement with HEALTHvision under which
both
organizations agreed to jointly market software and services to their customers.
Under this agreement, we paid HEALTHvision the sum of $22million during
2005 for the sale of software and services, and owed HEALTHvision the sum of
$350,000 as of December31, 2005. Also, during 2005, we earned revenues
from HEALTHvision of $986,000 for hosting and other related services and had
accounts receivable due from HEALTHvision of $245,000 at December31, 2005.
For the year ended December31, 2005, HEALTHvision had total revenues of
approximately $219million unauditedand a net loss of
approximately $33million unauditedwith total assets of
approximately $60million unaudited. We are not required to provide
funding to HEALTHvision, and have made no guarantees on their behalf. In late
2003, we mutually agreed with HEALTHvision to terminate the joint marketing
arrangement of our agreement.
We
have a license agreement with Partners HealthCare
System, Inc. Partners. Under the terms of this license, we may develop,
commercialize, distribute and support certain technology that we have received
from Partners throughout the world with the exception of the Boston,
Massachusetts metropolitan area. Prior to our initial public offering, no
sales
of software incorporating the licensed technology were made and, consequently,
no royalties were paid by us pursuant to the license with Partners. The royalty
arrangement under the license terminated upon Eclipsys initial public offering.
After our initial public offering, we sold software incorporating the licensed
technology. We are obligated to offer to Partners and certain of its affiliates
a license for internal use, granted on most favored client terms, to all new
software applications developed by us, whether or not derived from the licensed
technology and major architectural changes to the licensed technology. Partners
and certain of its affiliates are also entitled to receive internal use
licenses, also granted on most favored client terms, for any changes to any
module or application included in the licensed technology requiring at least
one
person-year of technical effort.
In
2001, Partners entered into a contract with us for
the license of a new software application and related professional services.
This new software application consisted of an upgrade to an existing software
application that Partners had licensed from Transition Systems, Inc, an entity
that was acquired by us in December 1998. Under this new contract, Partners
paid
us the sums of $916,000, $691,000 and $627,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December31, 2005, Partners owed us the sum of $82,000
related to this contract. Mr.Jay Pieper, a director of Eclipsys, is Vice
President of Corporate Development and Treasury Affairs for Partners. Partners
was not affiliated with Eclipsys at the time of the negotiation of the Partners
license from Transition Systems, Inc.

Subsequent
event
In
January 2006, we effected a restructuring of our
operations which included a reduction in headcount of approximately 100
individuals and the reorganization of our senior management team. This
initiative is expected to result in a restructuring charge of approximately
$7
million in the first quarter of 2006. In connection with this initiative,
we expect to invest a portion of the anticipated cost reductions into
client-related activities including client support and professional
services.
On
January 9, 2006, we hired John E. Deady to assume the
position of Executive Vice President Customer Solutions. Mr. Deadys
responsibilities will include management of sales and marketing.
