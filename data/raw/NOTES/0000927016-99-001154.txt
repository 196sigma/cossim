GENSYM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1 OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company is a leading supplier of software products and services for
developing and deploying intelligent systems that manage and improve complex,
dynamic operations for a broad range of industrial, scientific, commercial,
and government applications.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of
certain significant accounting policies, as described in this note and
elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
A PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.
B CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Company accounts for investments under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company investments are classified
as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value, which approximates
amortized cost at December 31, 1998. Cash equivalents are short-term,
highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of less than three
months. Short-term investments held as of December 31, 1998 and 1997
consist of municipal bonds with original maturity dates greater than
three months that mature within one year. Long-term investments held as
of December 31, 1997 consist of municipal bonds with maturity dates of
greater than one year.
C DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the 
straight-line method by charges to operations in amounts that allocate
the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives as follows                            Estimated
Asset Classification       Useful Lives
Computer equipment
and software.  3 Years
Furniture and fixtures.  5 Years
Leasehold improvements.  Shorter of lease term or
useful life
D REVENUE RECOGNITION
Product revenues are recognized upon shipment or upon the completion of
all significant obligations by the Company, whichever is later, provided
that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by
management. If conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to
delivery, revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance. Revenue from
the sale of multicopy licenses is recognized upon the shipment of the
product master or the first copy of the software product if the product
master is not to be delivered. Revenues derived from consulting and
training are recognized upon performance of the services provided that
the amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed
collectible by management. Software maintenance fees are recognized as
revenue ratably over the period to which they relate. Deferred revenue
represents primarily advance billings for software services, which
include maintenance, consulting, training and license prepayment fees.
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 97-2 SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition. The Company has adopted this pronouncement in fiscal 1998,
as required by SOP 97-2. The Company believes that its current revenue
recognition practices are consistent with those required by SOP 97-2.
E RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
In accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed, the Company has
evaluated the establishment of technological feasibility of its various
products during the development phase. Due to the dynamic changes in the
market, the Company has concluded that it cannot determine technological
feasibility until the development phase of the project is nearly
complete. The time period during which costs could be capitalized from
the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general
product release is very short and, consequently, the amounts that could
be capitalized are not material to the Company financial position or
results of operations. Therefore, the Company charges all research and
development expenses to operations in the period incurred.
34
F FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated in
accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. In accordance
with SFAS No. 52, assets and liabilities of the Company foreign
operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, and
income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange
prevailing during the year. Gains and losses arising from translation are
accumulated as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and
losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are
included in other income and were not material for the periods presented.
G RETIREMENT PLAN
Effective January 1997, the Company amended the Gensym Corporation 401k
Plan the Plan to allow for employer matching contributions. The
Company has elected to contribute an amount equal to 50% of the first 4   and 25% of the next 4% of an employee compensation as defined
contributed to the Plan as an elective deferral. The Company
contributions to the Plan were $316,000 and $314,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. There were no Company
contributions for the year ended December 31, 1996.
H CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
SFAS No. 105, Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentration of
Credit Risk, requires disclosure of any significant off-balance-sheet and
credit risk concentrations. Financial instruments, which potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, are principally cash,
cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The Company places
its cash, cash equivalents and investments in highly rated institutions.
No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of total revenues or
represented a significant credit risk to the Company in 1998, 1997, or
1996. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of accounts
receivable during 1998 or 1997. The Company has no significant off-
balance-sheet concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange
contracts, options contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements.
I INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, basic income loss
per share was computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted
income loss per share was computed using the weighted average number of
common and potential common shares outstanding during the periods in
accordance with the treasury stock method. For the years ended December
31, 1998 and 1997, the computation for diluted loss per share excludes the
effect of 31,066 shares and 81,872 shares, respectively, shares issuable
from assumed exercise of options, as their effect would be antidilutive.
The weighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, for the
year ended December 31, 1996 includes 376,659 potential common shares from
the assumed exercise of options.
J USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
K RECLASSIFICATION
Certain balances have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.
L NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133
establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging
activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure
those instruments at fair value. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal
quarters beginning after June 15, 1999. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 to have a material impact to its financial
position.
2 LINE OF CREDIT
The Company has a working capital line of credit with a bank under which
borrowings and/or letters of credit are limited to $1,000,000. The line of
credit is unsecured, and borrowings bear interest at the prime rate 775% as
of December 31, 1998. The line of credit expires on April 30, 2000 and
requires the Company to comply with certain financial ratios, including
minimum levels 
35
of net worth and profitability. The Company obtained a waiver from the bank
with respect to the Company not satisfying the profitability and net worth
covenant as of December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 1998, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the line of credit.
3 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

offering in February 1996.
D STOCK OPTION PLANS
The following table shows the Company stock option plans, the number of
shares reserved for issuance by the Company Board of Directors, and the
number of shares available for future issuance as of December 31, 1998                                       Number of Shares

1997 Stock Incentive Plan              100,000          78,000
1,734,850          464,397
The 1987 Stock Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, stock awards, and direct sales of stock. The
Board of Directors has resolved not to grant any more options under the
1987 Stock Plan. The 1994 Stock Option Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options. The 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.
Under these plans, incentive stock options may be granted at an exercise
price not less than the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on
the date of grant or, in the case of 10% stockholders, not less than 110%
of the fair market value. Nonqualified options may be granted by the Board
of Directors at its discretion. The difference, if any, between the
exercise price and the fair value of the underlying Common Stock at the
measurement date is charged to operations over the vesting period of such
options. The terms of exercise of options granted under these plans are
determined by the Board of Directors. Incentive stock options expire no
later than 10 years after the date of grant.
The Board of Directors, on October 22, 1998, authorized the repricing of
certain incentive stock options. Under the repricing plan, option holders
were permitted to voluntarily exchange their old options for new options.
The new options allow the option holders to purchase 80% of the number of
shares of Common Stock represented by the old options at a price equal to
the closing price of the Company Common Stock, or for officers, at a
price equal to 110% of the closing price, on November 20, 1998. All other
terms and conditions of the new options remain identical to the old options
agreement. The closing price of the Common Stock on November 20, 1998 was
$388. Under the repricing plan, 670,160 incentive stock options were
cancelled and 539,948 incentive stock options were reissued.
The 1995 Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan was approved by
the stockholders in January 1996 and amended in May 1997. The Director
Plan provides for the grant of options to purchase Common Stock of the
Company to non-employee directors of the Company. Upon completion of the
initial public offering of the Company Common Stock, each non-employee
36
director was granted an option under the Director Plan to purchase 2,000
shares of Common Stock at the initial public offering price. On June 30 of
each year, beginning in 1997, each non-employee director is granted an
option to purchase 3,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal
to the last reported sale price of the Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market on the date of grant. Such options vest in equal portions
over a five year period and expire 10 years from the date of grant.
The following schedule summarizes the stock option activity under all
option plans for the three years ended December 31, 1998                                 Number         Option Price      Weighted Average

The Company 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors in November 1995 and approved by the
stockholders in January 1996. The Purchase Plan authorizes the sale of
Common Stock to participating employees. In January 1998 the board of
directors amended the Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares of
Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan from 200,000 to 500,000.
All employees of the Company meeting certain eligibility requirements are
eligible to participate in the Purchase Plan. An employee may elect to
have a whole number percentage from 1% to 10% of his or her base pay
withheld during the payroll deduction period Offering Period for purposes
of purchasing shares under the Purchase Plan. The price at which shares
may be purchased during each offering will be 85% of the fair market value
per share of the Common Stock on either the first day or the last day of
the Offering Period, whichever is lower.  The Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors may, at its discretion, choose an Offering Period of
12 months or less for each of the offerings and choose a different Offering
Period for each offering. Under the Purchase Plan, the Company had sold
291,900 shares as of December 31, 1998.
37
E STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has computed the pro forma disclosure required under SFAS No.
123 for all stock compensation plans during the three years ended December
31, 1998, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model under the fair value
method prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The assumptions used are as follows                                      1998         1997         1996

Expected volatility                  70%          63%          65   For the purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of
options is amortized to expense over the vesting period. Had compensation
costs for options and Purchase Plan shares been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the effect
would have been as follows                                        1998         1997         1996

Pro forma diluted income loss per share as adjusted        $043        $095      $   028   The estimated weighted average fair value of options granted during 1998,
1997, and 1996 was $325, $395, and $848 per share, respectively. The
estimated weighted average fair values of grants made under the Purchase
Plan during 1998, 1997, and 1996 was $197, $199, and $397, respectively,
computed using the assumptions described above with an expected life of six
months for the option feature present in the Purchase Plan awards. At
December 31, 1998, the weighted average remaining life of outstanding stock
options was 722 years.
F STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In the third quarter of 1998, the Company began a program to repurchase
up to 650,000 shares of its Common Stock on the open market. As of December
31, 1998, 345,200 shares had been repurchased at a cost of $1,278,000.

The net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates through 2012 and
are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue
Service.
The Internal Revenue Code contains provisions that may limit the net
operating loss and credit carryforwards that the Company may utilize in any
one year in the event of certain cumulative changes in ownership over a three
year period. In the event that the Company has had a change in ownership, as
defined, utilization of the carryforwards may be restricted.
The Company has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax
asset to the extent that it cannot conclusively demonstrate that these assets
more likely than not will be realized.
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the statutory federal income tax rate as follows                                   1998           1997          1996

other employee termination costs and the write off of certain assets that
would provide no future benefit to the Company as a result of the
restructuring plan. In the third quarter of 1997, the Company recorded a
restructuring credit of $485,000 for the recovery of its investment in a
joint venture, a portion of which had been written off in the previous

9 SEGMENT REPORTING
On December 31, 1998, Gensym adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information. This pronouncement established
standards for public companies relating to the reporting of financial and
descriptive information about their operating segments in financial
statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance of the business.
The Company has historically evaluated its operations in three geographical
segments: Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia-Pacific.
The Company markets and sells its products through its direct sales force in
the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia, as well as through selected
distributors in other countries, including Japan. The Company also sells its
products through value-added resellers and systems integrators, who provide
consulting services and integrated solutions to their customers. The Company
further licenses technology to OEMs, who embed the technology within their
product offerings.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 1. The Company evaluates performance of its segments based on revenues
and segment profitability. Segment profitability is defined by the Company
as gross contribution, which is computed based on gross profit less
identifiable operating costs--principally sales and marketing costs.
Information as to the operations of the different segments is set forth
below                                      in thousands

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Gensym Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gensym
Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Gensym Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
