REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a Delaware corporation and Subsidiaries
at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information
set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Notes 2 and 14, effective November 26, 1998, the Company
changed the method of accounting for ICN Yugoslavia, a previously consolidated
subsidiary, and reduced the carrying value of the investment to its fair value.

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1999
1. ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND
ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company was formed in
November 1994, as a result of the merger of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SPI
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Viratek, Inc. and ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Biomedicals
collectively, the Predecessor Companies, in a transaction accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting the Merger. The Company is a global
research based pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, distributes
and sells pharmaceutical, research, and diagnostic products and provides
radiation monitoring services.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned
subsidiaries. Investments in 20% through 50% owned affiliated companies are
included under the equity method where the Company exercises significant
influence over operating and financial affairs. Investments in less than 20%
owned companies are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the elimination of all
significant intercompany account balances and transactions.
Effective November 26, 1998, the Company equity ownership for ICN
Yugoslavia was effectively reduced from 75% to 35% based upon a decision by the
Yugoslavian Ministry of Economic and Property Transformation. Additionally,
representatives of the Company and ICN Yugoslavia management have been denied
access to the premises and any representation as to the management of ICN
Yugoslavia. As a result, the Company is no longer able to influence the
operating and financial affairs of ICN Yugoslavia. Accordingly, the Company has
deconsolidated the financial statements of ICN Yugoslavia as of November 26,
1998, and reduced the carrying value of its investment to fair value, currently
estimated to be zero. The Company will account for its ongoing investment in ICN
Yugoslavia under the cost method. The Company did not recognize any revenues or
expenses related to its investment in Yugoslavia in 1999. See Note 14.
Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents include repurchase agreements,
certificates of deposit, money market funds, and municipal debt securities which
have maturities of three months or less. For purposes of the consolidated
statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly-liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates fair value due to the
short-term maturity of these instruments. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, cash
equivalents totaled $159,544,000 and $77,241,000, respectively.
Marketable Securities: The Company classifies its investments as available
for sale. Changes in market values are reflected as unrealized gains and losses,
calculated on the specific identification method, in stockholders' equity. In
1998, upon the exchange and redemption of the Company Bio Capital Holdings
5 1/2% Swiss Franc Exchangeable Certificates the New Certificates,
marketable securities previously held in trust for the payment of the New
Certificates became available to the Company and were sold, resulting in a gain
of $1,993,000.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: The Company evaluates the collectibility
of its receivables at least quarterly, based upon various factors including the
financial condition and payment history of major customers, an overall review of
collections experience on other accounts and economic factors or events expected
to affect the Company future collections experience.
Inventories: Inventories, which include material, direct labor and factory
overhead, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis. The Company evaluates the carrying value of
its inventories at least quarterly, taking into account such factors as
historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand, the
price the Company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets
compared with historical cost and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand.

ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. The Company primarily uses the straight-line method for depreciating
property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and
related improvements are depreciated from 7 - 50 years, machinery and equipment
from 3 - 30 years, furniture and fixtures from 3 - 15 years and leasehold
improvements and capital leases are amortized over their useful lives, limited
to the life of the related lease.
The Company follows the policy of capitalizing expenditures that materially
increase the lives of the related assets and charges maintenance and repairs to
expense. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation
or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting
gain or loss is included in income.
The Company capitalizes interest on borrowed funds during construction
periods as part of the cost of the related asset. During 1998, the Company
capitalized interest of $3,540,000; no interest was capitalized in 1999.
Goodwill and Intangibles: The difference between the purchase price and the
fair value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition is included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as goodwill and intangibles. Intangible
assets also include acquired product rights. Goodwill and intangibles
amortization periods range from 5 to 20 years depending upon the nature of the
business or product acquired. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying
value of goodwill and intangibles including the related amortization periods. In
evaluating goodwill, the Company determines whether there has been an impairment
and the amount thereof, if any, by comparing the undiscounted future operating
income of the acquired business with the carrying value of the goodwill. In
evaluating acquired product rights and other intangible assets, the Company
determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated
undiscounted future operating income of the product line with its carrying
value. If the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value, the
amount of the impairment, if any, will be determined by comparing the carrying
value of each intangible asset with its fair value. Fair value is generally
based on a discounted cash flows analysis. Based on its review, the Company does
not believe that any impairment of its goodwill and intangibles has occurred.
As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, goodwill and intangibles included the

Notes Payable: The Company classifies various borrowings with initial terms
of one year or less as notes payable. The weighted-average interest rate on
short-term borrowings outstanding at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was
approximately 74% and 85%, respectively.
Revenue Recognition: Revenues and related cost of product sales are
recorded at the time of shipment or as services are performed, provided that
collection of the revenue is reasonably assured.
Foreign Currency Translation: The assets and liabilities of the Company
foreign operations, except those in highly inflationary economies, are
translated at end of period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated
at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The effects of
unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars are accumulated in stockholders' equity. The
monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in highly inflationary
40

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
economies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end of period exchange rates and
non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical exchange rates. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign
Currency Translation, the Company has included in earnings all foreign exchange
gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and the effects of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations on subsidiaries operating in highly
inflationary economies. Recorded losses from foreign exchange translation and
transactions were $11,823,000, $80,501,000 and $12,790,000 for 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 is an asset and liability approach
that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the
Company financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS No. 109
generally considers all expected future events other than an enactment of
changes in tax laws or rates.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comprehensive Income: The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income includes such items as
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized holding gains and losses
on available-for-sale securities and are presented as a component of
stockholders' equity.
The balance of accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 1999
and 1998 consists of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments. None
of the components of other comprehensive income have been recorded net of any
tax provision or benefit as the Company does not expect to realize any
significant tax benefit or expense from these items.
Per Share Information: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares
outstanding. In computing diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average
number of shares outstanding is adjusted to reflect the effect of potentially
dilutive securities including options, warrants, and convertible debt or
preferred stock, and income available to common stockholders is adjusted to
reflect any changes in income or loss that would result from the issuance of the
dilutive common shares.
The Company Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash distribution of
$007 per share for each fiscal quarter of 1999 including the fourth quarter
1999 distribution declared in January 2000. During 1998, the Company Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend or distribution of $006 per share
for each fiscal quarter including the fourth quarter 1998 distribution declared
in January 1999. During 1997, the Company Board of Directors declared
quarterly cash distributions and dividends for each quarter, totaling $021 per
share.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company has adopted the disclosure only
provisions of SFAS No. 123 for stock options issued to employees. Compensation
cost for stock-based compensation issued to employees has been measured using
the intrinsic value method provided by Accounting Principles Board No. 25.
Reclassifications: Certain prior year items have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation, with no effect on previously
reported net income or stockholders' equity.

$3,141,000 was recorded in connection with the acquisition and is being
amortized over a 15 year estimated useful life.
Fuzio-Pharma Rt. -- Effective January 1, 1999, the Company acquired 97% of
Fuzio-Pharma Rt., a Hungarian distributor of pharmaceutical products with both
wholesale distribution and retail pharmacy operations, for approximately
$2,230,000. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is not material
to the financial position or results of operations of the Company. Goodwill of
$1,335,000 was recorded in connection with this acquisition and is being
amortized over a 15 year estimated useful life.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In June 1996, the Company made a short-term loan to the Chairman and CEO in
the amount of $3,500,000 for certain personal obligations. During August 1996,
this amount was repaid to the Company. In
42
43
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
connection with this transaction, the Company guaranteed $3,600,000 of debt of
the Chairman with a third party bank. In addition to the guarantee, the Company
deposited $3,600,000 with this bank as collateral to the Chairman debt. This
deposit is recorded as a long-term asset on the consolidated balance sheet. The
Chairman has provided collateral to the Company guarantee in the form of a
right to the proceeds of the exercise of options to acquire 150,000 shares with
an exercise price of $1517 and the rights to a $4,000,000 life insurance policy
provided by the Company. In the event of any default on the debt to the bank,
the Company has recourse that is limited to the collateral described above. Both
the transaction and the sufficiency of the collateral for the guarantee were
approved by the Board of Directors. In 1997, the Company made a short-term
advance of $327,000 to the Chairman and CEO, which was repaid, with interest, in
1997.
5. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit risk related to its cash
deposits and marketable securities. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with respected financial institutions and limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution. The Company cash and cash
equivalents and restricted cash include $160,000,000 and $109,000,000, at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, held in time deposits, money market
funds, and municipal debt securities through approximately ten major financial
institutions.

In connection with the merger in 1994, the Company acquired approximately
$226,000,000 of net operating loss carryforwards NOLs. Included in the total
acquired NOLs were $191,000,000 of domestic NOLs and $35,000,000 of foreign
NOLs. Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on
the availability of domestic NOLs that can be used to reduce taxable income
after certain substantial ownership changes of a corporation. Consequently, the
Company annual limitation on utilization of the acquired domestic NOLs is
approximately $33,000,000 per year.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has domestic and foreign NOLs of
approximately $189,000,000 and $16,600,000, respectively and a capital loss
carryforward of $72,736,000. The Company NOLs begin to expire in the year 2000
and the capital loss carryforward expires in the year 2003.
In 1999, the valuation allowance primarily relates to the deduction for the
write-off of ICN Yugoslavia and a $12,548,000 tax benefit from the exercise of
stock options included in the NOL carryforward. Upon realization, the
$12,548,000 tax benefit of stock options included in the NOL carryforward will
be added to additional capital. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets
is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income prior to
expiration of the loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets
will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced.

In Russia, the Company continues to benefit from special tax relief that
benefits pharmaceutical companies. Under this relief approximately 75% of the
income generated in Russia related to the manufacture and sale of prescription
medicines is exempt from taxation. This reduces the statutory rate to
approximately 8%. The continuing tax benefits in Russia are subject to potential
changes in tax law that may be enacted in the future. Should these benefits be
repealed, income generated in Russia would require the Company to provide taxes
at the current statutory rate of 35%.
In Hungary, the Company benefited from a tax holiday, which expired on
December 31, 1998.
In 1998 and 1997, the Company received the benefit of certain favorable tax
laws in Yugoslavia that resulted in income taxes at a rate lower than the 25%
Yugoslavian statutory rate. Under Yugoslavian law, taxable earnings attributed
to foreign investment are exempt from taxation for a five-year period.
Accordingly, 75% of ICN Yugoslavia taxable income, the Company ownership in
ICN Yugoslavia, was exempt from taxation for the five years ended December 31,
1996. Also in Yugoslavia, the Company received a tax credit for capital
investments, which may include short-term government bonds and property and
equipment, which can only be used in the year in which the investment is made.
Effective January 1, 1997, additional changes in the Yugoslavian tax law
resulted in benefits to the Company in the form of a reduction in taxes
otherwise payable as a result of its foreign investment in ICN Yugoslavia.
ICN Hungary generated tax loss carryforwards in 1999 and in 1998. In 1998,
the Company Russian subsidiaries also generated deferred income tax assets,
primarily related to bad debt reserves. Management believes that it is more
likely than not that these future tax benefits will not be realized prior to
expiration as a result of the seizure of ICN Yugoslavia and the economic crisis
affecting Eastern Europe. Accordingly, the Company recorded a valuation
allowance against these loss carryforwards and deferred income tax assets,
resulting in no tax benefit being recorded in 1999 and 1998.
In 1999 and 1998, the provision for income taxes includes a deferred tax
benefit of $25,286,000 and $8,223,000, respectively, resulting from the
recognition of certain deferred tax assets through the reduction of the related
valuation allowance. During 1998, the Company acquired certain product rights
from Roche and SKB and in 1998 its partner, Schering-Plough, received FDA
approval to market RebetronTM for which the Company will receive royalties.
These new products and royalties are expected to generate future taxable income
that resulted in a deferred tax benefit related to the release of a portion of
the valuation allowance. Additionally, the Company has announced its intention
to dispose of its Biomedicals business which
45
46

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
management expects will result in a net capital gain. The capital gain will
result in a future tax benefit because a portion of the capital loss
carryforwards can be utilized to offset the expected future gain.
During 1999, no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes were provided on
the undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries with the
exception of the Company Panamanian subsidiary, Alpha Pharmaceuticals, since
management intends to reinvest those undistributed earnings in the foreign
operations. Included in consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 1999, is
approximately $186,000,000 of accumulated earnings of foreign operations that
would be subject to U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes, if and when
repatriated.

after discounts and costs of issuance, were $118,485,000 and $190,821,000,
respectively. The 8 3/4% Senior Notes are subject in limited circumstances to
redemption at the Company option at any time prior to November 15, 2001, at
10875% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In
connection with the private placement, the Company granted the purchasers of the
8 3/4% Senior Notes certain registration rights. The Company used a portion of
the proceeds from the 1999 issuance for principal payments of certain long-term
debt and short-term borrowings.
In August 1997, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of
$275,000,000 of its 9 1/4% Senior Notes Due 2005 the 9 1/4% Senior Notes for
net proceeds of $265,646,000. The 9 1/4% Senior Notes are redeemable in cash at
the option of the Company, in whole or in part, on or after August 15, 2001, at
specified redemption prices.
The 8 3/4% Senior Notes and the 9 1/4% Senior Notes together, the Senior
Notes each are general unsecured obligations of the Company which rank pari
passu in right of payment with all other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are
senior to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company. Upon a change of control
as defined in the related indentures, the Company will be required to offer to
repurchase the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued interest thereon to the date of repurchase.
Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi-annually. The indentures governing
the Senior Notes include certain covenants which may restrict the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, the payment of dividends and other restricted payments,
the creation of certain liens, the sale of assets, or the Company ability to
consolidate or merge with another entity, subject to certain qualifications and
exceptions.
During 1998, SFr. 37,670,000 principal amount of the New Certificates was
exchanged for an aggregate of approximately 802,000 shares of the Company
common stock and the remainder of the New Certificates were redeemed for cash.
Upon the exchange and redemption of the New Certificates, Danish bonds held in
trust for the payment of the New Certificates, having a market value of
approximately $22,958,000, became available to the Company and were sold. The
exchange increased stockholders' equity by $25,337,000 and reduced long-term
debt and accrued interest by $4,680,000.

The estimated fair value of the Company debt, based on quoted market
prices or on current interest rates for similar obligations with like
maturities, was approximately $585,108,000 and $549,819,000 compared to its
carrying value of $597,273,000 and $538,905,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
The Company has short and long-term lines of credit, classified in notes
payable, aggregating $7,639,000 under which borrowings of $687,000 were
outstanding at December 31, 1999. The lines of credit provide for short-term
borrowings and bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR approximately
59% at December 31, 1999 or other indices.
10. PREFERRED STOCK
In connection with the acquisition of rights to certain products from
SmithKline Beecham plc SKB in 1998, the Company issued 821 shares of its
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to SKB. Each share of the Series D
Convertible Preferred Stock was initially convertible into 750 shares of the
Company common stock together, the SKB Shares, subject to certain
antidilution adjustments, and had a liquidation preference of $28,000 per share.
Except under certain circumstances, SKB agreed not to sell the SKB Shares until
November 4, 1999, unless the market price of the Company common stock exceeded
$5000 per common share. In connection with the issuance of the SKB shares, the
Company guaranteed SKB a price initially at $3737 per common share, increasing
at a monthly rate of $043 per share for twenty months. The Company agreed to
pay SKB an additional amount in cash or, under certain circumstances, in shares
of common stock to the extent proceeds received by SKB from the sale of the SKB
Shares during the guarantee period ending in December 1999 and the then market
value of the unsold SKB Shares did not provide SKB with an average value of
$4600 per common share including any dividend paid on the SKB Shares. In
December 1999, the Company satisfied its obligation to SKB by repurchasing the
821 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for $28,313,000 in cash.
11. COMMON STOCK
During 1998, the Board of Directors and the stockholders each approved the
Company Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan.

During 1998, the Company extended by one year the term of options to
purchase an aggregate of 304,000 shares of common stock which are held by four
employees, including the Chairman and CEO and a director. The Company recorded
compensation expense of $2,909,000 related to these options.
In 1996, the Company acquired the net assets of the Siemens Dosimetry
Service Division of Siemens Medical Systems, Inc. Siemens, for 1,447,250
shares of the Company common stock the Siemens Shares plus other
consideration. On December 23, 1996, Siemens sold the Siemens Shares to certain
accounts over which an investment company exercised investment authority
collectively, the Purchasers, for $1300 per share. In conjunction with and
conditioned upon the consummation of the sale of the Siemens Shares, the Company
entered into an agreement the Put Agreement with the Purchasers pursuant to
which the Company sold 150,000 additional shares of common stock for $1,950,000
together with the Siemens Shares, the Purchaser Shares and sold to the
Purchasers, for $3,200,000, the right to put the Put Right 1,597,250 shares
of common stock, valued at $23,120,000 at December 31, 1996, to the Company at
$20 per share on January 10, 2000. The Put Agreement also entitled the Company
to a portion of any proceeds from the sale of the Purchaser Shares in excess of
the $20 per share put price. In 1997, the Purchaser sold substantially all
shares subject to the Put Right and the Put Right expired entirely; the
$23,120,000 value of the Purchaser Shares was added to the Company
stockholders' equity. In addition, the Company received a cash payment from the
Purchasers, which was also added to stockholders' equity.
Stock repurchase plan: In 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized
two stock repurchase programs. The first repurchase program authorized the
Company to repurchase up to $10,000,000 of its outstanding common stock. The
second authorized the Company to initiate a long-term repurchase program that
allows the Company to repurchase up to 3,000,000 shares of its common stock. In
executing the repurchase programs, the Company is limited by certain covenants
contained in the indentures relating to the Company Senior Notes. In the
indentures, the Company is permitted to repurchase up to $10,000,000 of its
common stock under the first program; however, repurchases under the second
program will only be permitted as the Company generates cumulative net income,
as provided for in the indentures. In 1998, the Company repurchased an aggregate
of 200,000 shares of its common stock for $4,450,000. In March 1999, the Company
repurchased additional shares of 223,967 of its common stock for $5,550,000,
completing its first stock repurchase program. In December 1999, the Company
repurchased additional shares of 390,200 of its common stock for $9,754,000,
initiating the second stock repurchase program.
During 1999, the Company sold certain put options to an independent third
party; the proceeds were used to purchase call options from the same party in a
private placement transaction not requiring any net cash outlay at the time. The
put options and the corresponding call options each expire from August 2000
through December 2000 and are exercisable only at the expiration dates. The
Company may, at its option, make a physical settlement, a cash settlement, or a
net share settlement of its positions under the put options and the call
options. The Company has a maximum potential obligation under the put options to
purchase 2,380,953

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
shares of its common stock for an aggregate price of approximately $67,500,000.
The call options entitle the Company to buy 1,064,085 shares of its common stock
for approximately $33,519,000. The net shares issuable in settlement of the put
options are considered outstanding for the purpose of computing diluted earnings
per share, based upon the market price of the Company common stock on December
31, 1999. The net settlement obligation of the Company was approximately
$7,200,000 or 285,714 shares at year-end 1999.
Stockholder Rights Plan: In connection with the Merger, the Company adopted
a Stockholder Rights Plan to protect stockholders' rights in the event of a
proposed or actual acquisition of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the
Company common stock. As part of this plan, each share of the Company common
stock carries a right to purchase one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of
Series A Preferred Stock the Rights, par value $001 per share, of the
Company at a price of $125 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
adjustment, which becomes exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain
events. The Rights are subject to redemption at the option of the Board of
Directors at a price of $001 per right until the occurrence of certain events.
The Rights expire on November 1, 2004.
Long-term Incentive Plan: The Company has a long-term incentive plan, which
provides for the issuance of shares of the Company common stock to senior
executives. Shares issued under the long-term incentive plan are restricted and
vest over a four-year period. In 1999, no shares were issued under the plan. In
1998, approximately 319,000 shares of the Company common stock having a value
of $10,466,000 were issued under this plan. Compensation expense for the value
of the common shares issued is being recognized over the vesting period and is
credited to additional capital. As of December 31, 1999, the unamortized
compensation cost related to the restricted shares was $4,861,000.
Contingently issuable shares: Effective October 1, 1998, the Company issued
2,883,871 shares of its common stock to Roche as part of the consideration for
the rights to four pharmaceutical products. Under the terms of the agreement
with Roche, the Company has guaranteed to Roche a per share price initially at
$3100, increasing at a rate of 6% per annum through December 31, 2000. Should
Roche sell any of the shares prior to December 31, 2000, the Company is entitled
to one-half of any proceeds realized by Roche in excess of the guaranteed price.
Should the market price of the Company common stock be below the guaranteed
price at the end of the guarantee period, the Company will be required to
satisfy the aggregate guarantee amount by payment to Roche in cash or, in
certain circumstances, in additional shares of the Company common stock. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company guarantee has been reduced to 500,000 shares of
its common stock from the 2,883,871 shares originally issued to Roche. The
aggregate guaranteed value of the shares held by Roche exceeds their market
value by approximately $3,995,000 at the end of 1999 and the Company may be
required to issue approximately 160,000 additional common shares in satisfaction
of this agreement.
Other: During 1999, the Company sold 2,041,498 shares of its common stock
to Schering-Plough for $42,000,000. The sale was pursuant to the terms of the
Stock Purchase Agreement made between the Company and Schering-Plough in 1995.
See Note 16. In 1997, long-term debt of the Company having an aggregate carrying
value of $124,060,000 was converted into 10,052,000 shares of the Company
common stock. In addition, the Company issued 812,000 shares of its common
stock, having a value of $10,000,000, in settlement of litigation. The Company
also issued 129,665 shares of its common stock, having a value of $1,875,000, in
payment of a portion of the 6% annual dividend on the Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock.
12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
On August 11, 1999, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
filed a complaint in the United States District Court against the Company, the
Chairman Milan Panic and one current and one former officer of the Company
the SEC Complaint. The SEC Complaint alleges that the Company and the
individual named defendants made untrue statements of material fact or omitted
to state material facts
52
53
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DECEMBER 31, 1999
necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and engaged in acts,
practices, and courses of business which operated as a fraud and deceit upon
other persons in violation of Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The action concerns the status and
disposition of the Company 1994 new drug application for VirazoleR as a
monotherapy treatment for hepatitis C the NDA. The SEC Complaint seeks
injunctive relief, unspecified civil penalties, and an order barring Mr. Panic
from acting as an officer or director of any publicly-traded company.
The Company has received subpoenas from a Grand Jury in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California requesting the production
of documents covering a broad range of matters over various time periods. The
Company understands that the Company, Mr. Panic, two current senior executive
officers, a former senior officer, a current employee, and a former employee of
the Company are targets of the investigation. The Company also understands that
a senior executive officer, a director, a former officer, a current employee and
a former employee are subjects of the investigation. The United States
Attorney office has advised counsel for the Company that the areas of its
investigation include disclosures made and not made concerning the NDA to the
public and other third parties; stock sales for the benefit of Mr. Panic
following receipt on November 28, 1994 of a letter from the FDA informing the
Company that the NDA had been found not approvable; possible violations of the
economic embargo imposed by the United States upon the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, based upon alleged sales by the Company and Mr. Panic of stock
belonging to Company employees; and, with respect to Mr. Panic, personal
disposition of assets of entities associated with Yugoslavia, including possible
misstatements and/or omissions in federal tax filings. The Company has, and
continues to, cooperate in the Grand Jury investigation. A number of current and
former employees of the Company have been interviewed by the government in
connection with the investigation. The United States Attorney office has
issued subpoenas requiring various current and former officers and employees of
the Company to testify before the Grand Jury. Certain current and former
officers and employees testified before the Grand Jury beginning in July 1998.
The Company has commenced litigation in the United States District Court of
the District of Columbia against the government of Yugoslavia and related
agencies to recover damages and obtain injunctive relief. In addition, the
government of Yugoslavia, through a related agency, filed an arbitration
proceeding against the Company before the International Chamber of Commerce for
damages related to the Company acquisition of majority control of ICN
Yugoslavia. The Company intends to prosecute vigorously its claims against the
FRY, the ROS, and the State Fund, and to defend against the State Fund claims
against the Company, which the Company believes to be meritless and filed solely
as a response to the action filed earlier by the Company in the District Court.
The Company is a party to other pending lawsuits or subject to a number of
threatened lawsuits. While the ultimate outcome of pending and threatened
lawsuits and the Grand Jury investigation cannot be predicted with certainty,
and an unfavorable outcome could have a negative impact on the Company, at this
time in the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters will
not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.
Product Liability Insurance: The Company is currently self-insured with
respect to product liability claims and could be exposed to possible claims for
personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products. While to date no
material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective
products has been successfully maintained against the Company, a substantial
claim, if successful, could have a negative impact on the results of operations
and cash flows of the Company.
Benefits Plans: The Company has a defined contribution plan that provides
all U.S. employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation for
payout at a subsequent date. The Company can voluntarily make matching
contributions on behalf of participating and eligible employees. The Company
expense related to such defined contribution plan was not material in 1999, 1998
and 1997.

Other: Milan Panic, the Company Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed under a contract expiring December 31, 2002 that provides
for, among other things, certain health and retirement benefits. The contract is
automatically extended at the end of each term for successive one year periods
unless either the Company or Mr. Panic terminates the contract upon six months
prior written notice. Mr. Panic, at his option, may provide consulting services
upon his retirement and will be entitled, when serving as a consultant, to
participate in the Company medical and dental plans. The consulting fee shall
not at any time exceed the annual compensation as adjusted, paid to Mr. Panic.
Upon Mr. Panic retirement, the consulting fee shall not be subject to further
cost-of-living adjustments.
The Company has employment agreements with seven key executives which
contain change in control benefits. Upon a change in control of the Company
as defined in the contract, the employee shall receive severance benefits equal
to three times salary and other benefits.
13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
The Company is a global, research-based pharmaceutical company that
develops, manufactures, distributes and sells pharmaceutical, research, and
diagnostic products and provides radiation monitoring services. The Company is
organized and operates in the Pharmaceuticals group and the Biomedicals group.
The Pharmaceuticals group produces and markets a variety of pharmaceutical
products worldwide and derives royalty revenues from sales of certain of its
products by a third party under a license agreement. The Biomedicals group
markets research products and related services, immunodiagnostic reagents and
instrumentation, and provides radiation monitoring services.
In 1999, the principal markets for the Company products were North
America, Western and Central Europe, and Latin America, which represented
approximately 36%, 27%, and 14%, respectively, of the Company revenues for the
year. Approximately 64%, 76%, and 82% of the Company revenues for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, were generated from
operations outside the United States. The Company foreign operations are
subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including
possible nationalization or expropriation, price and exchange controls,
limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises, health-care
regulation, and other restrictive governmental actions.
Changes in the relative values of currencies take place from time to time
and may materially affect the Company results of operations. Their effects on
the Company future operations are not predictable. The Company does not
currently provide any hedges on its foreign currency exposure and, in certain
countries in which the Company operates, no effective hedging programs are
available.
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which requires reporting certain financial
information according to the management approach. This approach requires
reporting information regarding operating segments on the basis used internally
by management to evaluate segment performance. SFAS 131 also requires
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers.
The Statement was effective December 31, 1998 and has been adopted for all
periods presented.
The Company is organized into business units on the basis of geographic
region. In applying SFAS 131, these business units have been aggregated into
seven reportable segments based on similar long-term economic characteristics.
During 1999, the Company decided to manage its Central European businesses from
the Western European headquarters in anticipation of the entry of Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic into the European Union. As a result, the Company
integrated ICN Hungary, ICN Czech Republic and ICN Poland into the Western and
Central Europe segment, which were previously reported under the Other Eastern
Europe segment. All amounts for 1998 and 1997 have been restated to conform with
the current year presentation.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 2. The Company evaluates segment performance based on income from
operations, which excludes intersegment sales as well

as interest income and expense and foreign exchange gains and losses. The
Company allocates amortization on the product rights acquired from Roche and SKB
among the segments where the related revenues are reported; the unamortized cost
of such acquired product rights is included in assets of the North America
Pharmaceuticals segment.

Revenues are attributed to the countries based upon the country of domicile
of the Company subsidiary which made the sale, with the exception of certain
sales exported from the United States into the Asia, Africa, and Australia
region, where the sales are attributed to the region based upon the location of
the customer. During 1997, sales to the Yugoslavian government and
government-sponsored entities represented approximately 22% of the Company
total revenues. For 1999 and 1998, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the
Company revenues. Long-lived assets principally consist of property, plant,
and equipment, acquired product rights, and goodwill.
14. ICN YUGOSLAVIA
On February 6, 1999, the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
acting through the Federal Ministry of Health and/or the Ministry of Health of
Serbia, seized control of the Company 75% owned subsidiary, ICN Yugoslavia.
This action, based on a decision by the Ministry for Economic and Property
Transformation that was reached on November 26, 1998, effectively reduced the
Company equity ownership of ICN Yugoslavia from 75% to 35%. The Ministry of
Economic and Property Transformation decision was based on the unilaterally
imposed recalculation of the Company original capital contribution to ICN
Yugoslavia. Subsequent to the seizure, the Commercial Court of Belgrade issued
an order stating that a
56

DECEMBER 31, 1999
change in control had occurred. These actions were taken, contrary to
Yugoslavian law, without any notification to or representation by the Company.
Since the change of control, representatives of the Company and ICN Yugoslavia
management have been denied access to the premises and any representation as to
the management of ICN Yugoslavia. As a result, the Company is no longer able to
influence the operating and financial affairs of ICN Yugoslavia and
deconsolidated the financial statements of ICN Yugoslavia as of November 26,
1998. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $235,290,000 in the fourth
quarter of 1998, which is included in Eastern European Charges in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. This charge reduces the carrying
value of the Company investment in ICN Yugoslavia to its fair value, currently
estimated to be zero.
The summary balance sheet of ICN Yugoslavia as of the effective date of the
write-off November 26, 1998 is presented below.

Through the first quarter of 1998, the majority of ICN Yugoslavia
domestic sales were made to the Yugoslavian government or government-funded
entities. During early 1997, the Company established credit terms with the
Yugoslavian government under which future receivables were interest-bearing with
one year terms and payable in dinars, but fixed in dollar amounts. At December
31, 1997, the Company had approximately $145,431,000 of notes receivable from
the Yugoslavian government under such terms. During the first quarter of 1998,
the Company continued to make sales to the Yugoslavian government and
government-sponsored entities under similar fixed dollar terms in order to
reduce the Company exposure to losses resulting from exchange rate
fluctuations. In the second quarter of 1998, the Yugoslavian government
defaulted on its obligations to the Company on $176,204,000 of accounts and
notes receivable. As a result of the government default and the suspension of
sales to the government, the Company recorded a $173,440,000 charge against
earnings at ICN Yugoslavia in the second quarter of 1998. The charge is included
in Eastern European Charges $165,646,000, cost of product sales $3,667,000,
and interest income $4,127,000 in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income. The charge consists of a $151,204,000 reserve for losses on notes
receivable including accrued interest, reserves of $7,757,000 for losses on
accounts receivable from government-sponsored entities, and a $14,479,000
write-down of the value of certain related investments and assets.

In the third quarter of 1998 ICN Yugoslavia recorded a charge for losses on
accounts receivable of $7,862,000 as a result of the Russian economic situation.
See Note 15.
15. ICN RUSSIA
The Company Russian operations generated 12%, 20%, and 18% of the
Company total revenues for the years 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Russia continues to experience economic difficulties following the
financial crisis of August 1998. Consequently, the ruble continues to devalue,
there is continued volatility in the debt and equity market, hyperinflation
persists, confidence in the banking sector has yet to be restored and there
continues to be general lack of liquidity in the economy. In addition, laws and
regulations affecting businesses operating within Russia continue to evolve.
Russia return to economic stability is dependent to a large extent on the
effectiveness of the measures taken by the government, decisions of
international lending organizations, and other actions, including regulatory and
political developments, which are beyond the Company control.
Since August 1998, the ruble fell sharply from a rate of 63 rubles to $1
to a rate of 207 rubles to $1 at December 31, 1998 and has further declined to
a rate of 275 rubles to $1 at December 31, 1999. As a result of these declines
in the ruble exchange rate, the Company recorded translation and exchange losses
of $53,848,000 and $6,738,000 related to its Russian operations during 1998 and
1999, respectively. As of December 31, 1999, ICN Russia had a net monetary asset
position of approximately $15,427,000, which is subject to foreign exchange loss
as further declines in the value of the ruble in relation to the dollar occur.
The Company believes that the economic and political environment in Russia
has affected the pharmaceutical industry in the region. Many Russian companies,
including many of the Company customers, continue to experience liquidity
problems as monetary policy has limited the money supply, and Russian companies
often lack access to an effective banking system. As a result, many Russian
companies have limited ability to pay their debts, which has led to a number of
business failures in the region. In addition, the devaluation has reduced the
purchasing power of Russian companies and consumers, thus increasing pressure on
the Company and other producers to limit price increases in hard currency terms.
These factors have affected, and may continue to affect, sales and gross margins
in the Company Russian operations. As a result of the Russian economic
situation, the Company recorded a charge in 1998 of $42,289,000, representing
reserves for accounts receivable of $37,873,000, the write-off of certain
investments of $2,011,000, and a reduction in the value of certain inventories
of $2,405,000.
16. AGREEMENT WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION
On July 28, 1995, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Supply
Agreement the License Agreement and a Stock Purchase Agreement the
Agreement with Schering-Plough Corporation Schering-Plough. Under the
License Agreement, Schering-Plough licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C HCV in combination with Schering-Plough
alpha interferon. The License Agreement provided the Company an initial
non-refundable payment and future royalty payments to the Company from sales of
ribavirin by Schering-Plough, including certain minimum royalty rates. As part
of the initial License Agreement, the Company retained the right to co-market
ribavirin capsules in the European Union under its trademark VirazoleR. In
addition, Schering-Plough was obligated to purchase up to $42,000,000 in common
stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones.
Under the Agreement, Schering-Plough is responsible for all clinical
developments worldwide. In 1998, the Company sold to Schering-Plough its right
to co-market oral ribavirin for the treatment of HCV in the European Union, in
exchange for increased royalty rates on sales of ribavirin worldwide. In
addition, the Company received a one-time payment of $16,500,000 from
Schering-Plough in consideration for the sale to Schering-Plough of the
additional marketing rights in the European Union, in settlement of past
royalties, and as reimbursement

for expenses incurred by the Company in preparation for the launch of ribavirin
capsules in the European Union.
In February and December 1999, Schering-Plough purchased 1,141,498 and
900,000 shares of the Company common stock for $27,000,000 and $15,000,000,
respectively.
