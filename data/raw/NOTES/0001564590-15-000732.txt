Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Innospec Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Innospec Inc. and its subsidiaries Innospec as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive loss, cash flows and stockholders
equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2014. We also have audited Innospecs internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Innospecs management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing in item 9A of the Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on Innospecs internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable 
48 Table of Contents
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness related to Innospecs lack of effective controls to ensure the proper application of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, related to the treatment of foreign
currency gains or losses on intercompany loan balances denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency has been identified and included in managements assessment. This material weakness was considered in determining
the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014 consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Innospec as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned
material weakness on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Innospec has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Innospec acquired Independence Oilfield Chemicals LLC Independence and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
Innospecs internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, Independences internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $2347 million of which $1508 million represents goodwill and
other intangibles included within the scope of the assessment and total revenues of $350million included in the consolidated financial statements of Innospec as of and for the year ended December31, 2014. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting of Innospec also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Independence.

Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives.  See Note
3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information on the Companys reportable segments. 
Note 2.Accounting Policies 
Basis of preparation: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America and include all subsidiaries of the Company where the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. All acquisitions are accounted
for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period
presentation.  Use of estimates: The preparation of the
consolidated financial statements, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash equivalents: Investment securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.  Short-term investments: Investment securities with maturities of more than 3 months and less than 12 months when
purchased are considered to be short-term investments.  Trade
and other accounts receivable: The Company records trade and other accounts receivable at net realizable value and maintains allowances for customers not making required 
55 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
payments. The Company determines the adequacy of allowances by periodically evaluating each customer receivable considering our customers financial condition, credit history and current
economic conditions.  Inventories: Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost FIFO method or market value. Cost includes materials, labor and an appropriate proportion of plant overheads. The Company accrues volume discounts where it is probable that the required volume will be attained and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. The discounts are recorded as a reduction in the cost of materials based on projected purchases over the period of the agreement. Inventories are adjusted for estimated obsolescence and written down to market value based
on estimates of future demand and market conditions.  Property,
plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method and is allocated between cost of goods
sold and operating expenses. The cost of additions and improvements are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses. When assets are sold or retired the associated cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated
financial statements and any related gain or loss is included in earnings. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:  Buildings 7 to 25 years Equipment 3to10years
Goodwill and other intangible assets:
Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
segment is less than the carrying amount prior to performing the two-step goodwill impairment test. If this is required we assess the fair value based on projected post-tax cash flows discounted at the Companys weighted average cost of
capital. The annual measurement date for impairment testing of the goodwill relating to the Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments is December31 each year. At this date we performed annual impairment tests and concluded that there
had been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments. The Company capitalizes software development costs, including licenses, subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Other intangible assets deemed to have
finite lives, including software development costs and licenses, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and tested for any potential impairment when events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an
impairment may have occurred.  Deferred finance costs: The
costs relating to debt financing are capitalized, separately disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized using the effective interest method over the expected life of the debt financing facility. 
56 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Impairment of long-lived assets: The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets,
including buildings and equipment, whenever changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying values may be impaired. In order to facilitate this test the Company groups together assets at the lowest possible level for which cash flow information
is available. Undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the assets are compared with the carrying value of the assets and if they are lower an impairment loss may be recognized. The amount of the impairment loss is the difference
between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Fair values are determined using post-tax cash flows discounted at the Companys weighted average cost of capital. 
Derivative instruments: From time to time, the Company uses various
derivative instruments including forward currency contracts, options, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage certain exposures. These instruments are entered into under the Companys corporate risk management policy to minimize
exposure and are not for speculative trading purposes. The Company recognizes all derivatives as either non-current assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that are not designated as hedges, or do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, are recognized in earnings. Derivatives which are designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis, and marked to market. The
ineffective portion of the derivatives change in value is recognized in earnings. The effective portion is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. 
Environmental compliance and remediation: Environmental compliance
costs include ongoing maintenance, monitoring and similar costs. We recognize environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated, and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be
reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future obligations are discounted to their present values using the Companys credit-adjusted risk-free rate. 
Acquisition-related contingent and deferred consideration: Deferred
consideration payable in cash is discounted to its fair value. Where deferred consideration is contingent upon pre-determined financial targets, an estimate of the fair value of the likely consideration payable is made. This contingent deferred
consideration is re-assessed annually and a corresponding adjustment is recognized in operating income, and the associated liability, to reflect the passage of time accretion expense and any revisions to the amount or timing of the initial
measurement.  Revenue recognition: The Company supplies
products to customers from its various manufacturing sites, and in some instances from containers held on customer sites, under a variety of standard shipping terms and conditions. In each case revenue is recognized when legal title, which is
defined and generally accepted in the standard terms and conditions, and risk of loss transfers between the Company and the customer. Provisions for sales discounts and rebates to customers are based upon the terms of sales contracts and are
recorded in the 
57 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
same period as the related sales as a deduction from revenue. The Company estimates the provision for sales discounts and rebates based on the terms of each agreement at the time of shipping.
Components of net sales: All amounts billed to customers
relating to shipping and handling are classified as net sales.Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company are classified as cost of goods sold. 
Components of cost of goods sold: Cost of goods sold is comprised of raw material costs including inbound freight, duty and non-recoverable taxes,
inbound handling costs associated with the receipt of raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs including labor costs, maintenance and utility costs, plant and engineering overheads, amortization expense for certain other intangible
assets, warehousing and outbound shipping costs and handling costs. Inventory losses and provisions and the costs of customer claims are also recognized in the cost of goods line item.  Components of selling, general and administrative expenses: Selling expenses comprise the costs of the direct sales
force, and the sales management and customer service departments required to support them. It also comprises commission charges, the costs of sales conferences and trade shows, the cost of advertising and promotions, amortization expense for certain
other intangible assets, and the cost of bad and doubtful debts. General and administrative expenses comprise the cost of support functions including accounting, human resources, information technology and the cost of group functions including
corporate management, finance, tax, treasury, investor relations and legal departments. Provision of managements best estimate of legal and settlement costs for litigation in which the Company is involved is made and reported in the
administrative expense line item.  Research and development
expenses: Research, development and testing costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.  Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of options that
are dilutive and outstanding during the period.  Foreign
currencies: The Companys policy is that foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of the balance sheets of entities that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are taken to a separate equity reserve, the
cumulative translation adjustment. In entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency no gains or losses on translation occur, and gains or losses on monetary assets relating to currencies other than the U.S. dollar are taken to the income
statement in other net income/expense. Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency loans which are long-term in nature, which the Company does not intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. Other foreign exchange gains or losses are also included in other net income/expense in the income statement. 
58 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Stock-based compensation plans: The Company accounts for employee stock options and stock
equivalent units under the fair value method. Stock options are fair valued at the grant date and the fair value is recognized straight-line over the vesting period of the option. Stock equivalent units are fair valued at each balance sheet date and
the fair value is spread over the remaining vesting period of the unit.  Pension plans and other post-employment benefits: The Company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit post-retirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the funded
status in comprehensive income. The measurement date of the plans funded status is the same as the Companys fiscal year-end. The service costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the post-employment
benefits. Prior service costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants using the corridor method.  Income taxes: The Company provides for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the relevant tax bases of the assets and liabilities. When appropriate, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred
tax assets. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax
positions as part of income taxes in our consolidated statements of income.  Note 3. Segmental Reporting and Geographical Area Data 
Innospec divides its business into three segments for management and reporting purposes: Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives. The
Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities although their ultimate customers are different. The Octane Additives segment is generally characterized by volatile and declining
demand.  In 2014, the Company had as a significant customer in the
Fuel Specialties segment, Royal Dutch Shell plc and its affiliates Shell, which accounted for $819 million 85%of our net group sales. In 2013 and 2012, Shell accounted for $831 million 10%and $829 million
11%of our net group sales, respectively.

Gross cost is net of $87 million, $03 million and $2895 million of historical accumulated amortization in respect of the Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and
Octane Additives reporting segments, respectively. 
The Companys reporting units, the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are consistent with the reportable segments: Fuel Specialties,
Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives. The components in each segment including products, markets and competitors have similar economic characteristics and the segments, therefore, reflect the lowest level at which operations and cash flows
can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Company.  The Company tests goodwill annually for impairment, or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggests impairment may have occurred. At December31, 2014, the fair value of our
Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals segments substantially exceeds the carrying value. 
64 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
To determine the fair value of each of our segments we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology based
on the forecast future after-tax cash flows from operations for each since we believe this provides the best approximation of fair value. This methodology requires us to make assumptions and estimates including those in respect of future revenue
growth and gross margins, which are based upon our long range plans, and the Companys weighted average cost of capital. Our long range plans are regularly updated as part of our planning processes and are reviewed and approved by management
and our Board of Directors. We assume terminal values for the Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals reporting units which are added to the present value of the relevant forecast future cash flows. We assume no terminal value for the Octane
Additives reporting unit beyond its estimated future life. The discounted cash flow methodology does not assume a control premium. We use a discount rate equivalent to the Companys weighted average cost of capital which is estimated by
reference to the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants in the Company. We assign assets and liabilities, including deferred taxes and goodwill, to our reporting units if the asset or liability relates to
the operations of that reporting unit and is included in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. Cash and debt obligations are excluded from the carrying value of our reporting units. 
In 2014 some of the assumptions and estimates underpinning our discounted
cash flows were revised as part of our planning processes although the methodology was unchanged. The most significant revisions were that the Companys weighted average cost of capital was changed to reflect the changing proportion of debt to
equity funding of the Company.  The Company elected to perform its
annual tests in respect of Fuel Specialties and Performance Chemicals goodwill as at December31 each year.At December31, 2014 we had $2294 million and $467 million of goodwill relating to our Fuel Specialties and Performance
Chemicals segments, respectively.At this date we performed annual impairment tests and concluded that there had been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments.  We believe that the assumptions used in our annual and quarterly impairment tests are reasonable, but that they are judgmental,
and variations in any of the assumptions may result in materially different calculations of impairment charges, if any. 
Independence Acquisition 
On October27, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in Independence Oilfield Chemicals LLC Independence.
Independence, based in Houston Texas, services the oil and gas industry, with a focus on completion, stimulation and production chemicals. We purchased Independence for a total discounted consideration of $1918 million, with an initial payment at
closing of $990 million funded from existing cash and debt facilities. As Independence has been in a phase of very rapid growth, the remaining payments are performance related and contingently payable over the next two years based on a
65 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
multiple of Independences annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization plus a percentage of free cash flow. Based on the current forecasts for
Independences performance, Innospec will make two deferred consideration payments, with the first one being $457 million payable approximately one year after closing, and the second one being $495 million payable approximately two years
after closing, with a portion of such deferred payments payable, at Innospecs election, in shares of Innospecs common stock. We acquired the business in order to move forward our strategy of building a new market leader in the oilfield
specialties sector which forms part of our Fuel Specialties segment.  Included in the consolidated income statement of the Company since the acquisition date, are the following revenue and earnings for Independence, including an accretion charge of $24 million:  in millions

Note 9. Pension Plans 
United Kingdom plan 
The Company maintains a defined benefit pension plan the Plan
covering a number of its current and former employees in the United Kingdom, although it does also have other much smaller pension arrangements in the U.S. and overseas. The Plan is closed to future service accrual but has a large number of deferred
and current pensioners. The Projected Benefit Obligation PBO is based on final salary and years of credited service reduced by social security benefits according to a plan formula. Normal retirement age is 65 but provisions are made
for early retirement. The Plans assets are invested by several investment management companies in funds holding United Kingdom and overseas equities, United Kingdom and overseas fixed interest securities, index linked securities, property unit
trusts and cash or cash equivalents. The trustees investment policy is to seek to achieve specified objectives through investing in a suitable mixture of real and monetary assets. The trustees recognize that the returns on real assets, while
expected to be greater over the long-term than those on monetary assets, are likely to be more volatile. A mixture across asset classes should nevertheless provide the level of returns required by the Plan to meet its liabilities at an acceptable
level of risk for the trustees and an acceptable level of cost to the Company.  During the second quarter of 2010 the Company implemented a pension increase exchange PIE program for current pensioners, effective April1, 2010, which reduced the PBO by $171
million. This reduction in PBO resulted in a prior service credit which is being amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining life expectancy of Plan pensioners of 15 years commencing April1, 2010. 
When the plan closed to future accrual in 2010 all employees became inactive
and GAAP requires that the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used, instead of the average remaining service, to spread future amortization of actuarial net losses. The average remaining life expectancy of the inactive
participants has been approximately 24years since the plan closed in 2010.  In 2014, the Company contributed approximately $114 million in cash to the Plan in accordance with an actuarial deficit recovery plan agreed with the trustees.

The discount rate used represents the
annualized yield based on a cash flow matched methodology with reference to an AA corporate bond spot curve and having regard to the duration of the Plans liabilities. The inflation rate is derived using a similar cash flow matched methodology
as used for the discount rate but having regard to the difference between yields on fixed interest and index linked United Kingdom government gilts. A 025% change in the discount rate assumption would change the PBO by approximately $29 million and
the net pension credit for 2015 by approximately $03 million. A 025% change in the level of price inflation assumption would change the PBO by approximately $22 million and the net pension credit for 2015 would be unchanged. 
The current investment strategy of the Plan is to obtain an asset allocation
of 65% debt securities and 35% equity securities in order to achieve a more predictable return on assets. As at December31, 2014, approximately 50% December 31, 2013 55% of the Plans assets were held in index-tracking funds with
one investment management company. Approximately 40% December 31, 2013 25% of the Plans assets were invested in United Kingdom government gilts. No more than 5% of the Plans assets were invested in any one individual
companys investment funds.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the
Plan was $8171 million and $8198 million at December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  For the vast majority of assets, a market approach is adopted to assess the fair value of the assets, with the inputs being the quoted market prices for the actual securities held in the relevant fund.
For Level 3 assets where there is no ready market and for which no indicative dealer prices are available, fund assets are independently evaluated, with the use of agreed upon procedures conducted by an audit firm to provide independent confirmation
that proper valuation procedures are being followed. Plan assets that are invested in comingled funds are valued using a unit price or net asset value that is based on the underlying investments of the fund. Level 3 assets include investments in
private equities valued using significant un-observable inputs.

All of the $62 million of unrecognized tax
benefits, and interest and penalties, would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. 
The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns with the U.S.
federal government, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As previously disclosed, as at December31, 2013, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries were subject to tax audits in the U.S. On March6, 2014, the federal income tax
examination by the IRS for 2009 was effectively settled. The additional tax cost was nominal and resulted in a reduction of 
77 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
$36million in unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction of $04 million in associated interest and penalties in the first quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2014, the Company
recorded a reduction of $29 million in unrecognized tax benefits and $02 million in associated interest and penalties due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations and there was a $03 million addition to unrecognized tax benefits
recorded during the fourth quarter of 2014.  The Company and its
U.S. subsidiaries remain open to examination by the IRS for years 2011 onwards. The Companys subsidiaries in foreign tax jurisdictions are open to examination including France 2013 onwards, Germany 2010 onwards, Switzerland 2013 onwards
and the United Kingdom 2013 onwards.  The sources of income

As a result of the Companys assessment of its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2014,
the Company considers it more likely than not that no valuation allowance is required for $06 million 2013 $03 million of its net operating loss carry forwards and that no valuation allowance is required against its foreign tax credit
carry forwards 2013 $00 million.  The net operating loss
carry forwards arose in the U.S. and in one of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. The net operating loss carry forwards in the U.S. arose in the prior periods as a result of state tax losses. It is expected that sufficient taxable profits will
be generated in the U.S. against which these net operating loss carry forwards can be relieved prior to their expiration in 2021. The foreign tax credit carry forwards arose in the U.S. in prior periods. The Company has determined that future
foreign income inclusions will be sufficient to utilize all of the $08 million 2013 $45 million of the foreign tax credit carry forwards prior to their expiration in 2021 and therefore no valuation allowance is required. The net operating
loss carry forwards in one of the Companys foreign subsidiaries arose in the current period and it is expected that sufficient taxable profits will be generated against which these net operating loss carry forwards can be relieved. 
Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than
not that these assets will be realized, a valuation allowance would be required, and the Companys operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such a determination would be made. 
The Company is in a position to control whether or not to repatriate foreign
earnings and we intend to permanently reinvest earnings overseas to fund overseas subsidiaries. No taxes have been provided for the unremitted earnings of our overseas subsidiaries as any tax basis differences relating to investments in these
overseas subsidiaries are considered to be permanent in duration. The amount of unremitted earnings at December31, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $743 million and $605 million, respectively. If these earnings are remitted, additional taxes
could result after offsetting foreign income taxes paid although the calculation of the additional taxes is not practicable to compute at this time.

On December14, 2011, we entered into a five-year revolving credit facility which provides for
borrowings by us of up to $1000 million. The facility carries an interest rate based on U.S. dollar LIBOR plus a margin of between 150% and 225% which is dependent on the Companys ratio of net debt to EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of
liquidity defined in the credit facility. The facility can be drawn down until it expires on December14, 2016. We repaid the previous finance facility, which was due to expire on February6, 2012, upon entering into the new credit
facility.  On August28, 2013, we amended our existing
five-year revolving credit facility the facility. The amendment provides for an increase in the facility available to the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company from $1000 million to $1500 million and retains the term and
conditions of the original facility through to December 2016. In addition, an amendment allowed the Company to request an additional amount of $500 million to be committed by the lenders, of which $300 million was committed in the fourth quarter
of 2013.  On July31, 2014 the Company increased its
borrowing capacity by $200 million such that its credit facility now provides for borrowings by us of up to $2000 million until it expires on December14, 2016 and may be drawn down in full in the U.S. 
The Companys credit facility contains restrictive clauses which may
constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility. The facility obliges the lenders to comply with a request for utilization of finance unless there is an event of default outstanding. Events of default are defined in the
credit facility and include a material adverse change to our assets, operations or financial condition. The facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, amongst other things, and subject to certain limited exceptions, to incur
additional indebtedness, pledge our assets as security, guarantee obligations of third parties, make investments, undergo a merger or consolidation, dispose of assets, or materially change our line of business. 
In addition, the credit facility contains terms which, if breached, would
result in it becoming repayable on demand. It requires, among other matters, compliance with the following financial covenant ratios measured on a quarterly basis: 1the ratio of net debt to EBITDA shall not be greater than 25:1 and
2the ratio of EBITDA to net interest shall not be less than 40:1. Management has determined that the Company has not breached these covenants throughout the period to December31, 2014 and expects to not breach these covenants for the
next 12 months. The credit facility is secured by a number of fixed and floating charges over certain assets which include key operating sites of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
On September13, 2011, the Company settled the NewMarket Corporation
civil complaint. The settlement agreement included the Company issuing a $150 million promissory note to NewMarket Corporation payable in three equal annual installments carrying simple interest at 1%per annum, the final installment of
which was paid on September9, 2014. 
82 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The weighted average rate of interest on borrowings was 17% at December31, 2014 and 16% at
December31, 2013. Payments of interest on long-term debt were $23 million, $10million and $05 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
The net cash outflows in respect of refinancing costs were $01 million, $09 million and $00million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Note 12.Plant Closure Provisions 
The principal site giving rise to environmental
remediation liabilities is the manufacturing site at Ellesmere Port in the United Kingdom, which management believes is the last ongoing manufacturer of TEL. There are also environmental remediation liabilities on a much smaller scale in respect of
our other manufacturing sites in the U.S. and Europe. The liability for estimated closure costs of Innospecs manufacturing facilities includes costs for decontamination and environmental remediation activities remediation when demand for TEL
diminishes. Severance provisions have been made in relation to Corporate personnel and personnel in each of the three reporting segments. 
Movements in the provisions are summarized as follows:  in millions

83 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Amounts due within one year refer to provisions where expenditure is expected to arise within one year
of the balance sheet date. Severance charges are recognized in the income statement in selling, general and administrative expenses. Remediation costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.  Remediation 
The remediation provision represents the Companys liability for
environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. The charge for the period in 2014 represents the accretion expense recognized of $28 million and a further $22 million primarily in respect of changes in the expected cost and scope of
future remediation activities. A discount rate of 892% was used in valuing the remediation provision.  We recognize environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated, and asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation and costs can be reasonably
estimated. The Company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future expected costs, and comply with environmental legislation in the countries in which it operates or has operated in. The Company views the costs of
vacating our Ellesmere Port site as contingent upon if and when it vacates the site because there is no present intention to do so. The Company has further determined that, due to the uncertain product life of TEL particularly in the market for
aviation gasoline and other products being manufactured on the site, there are uncertainties as to the probability and timing of the expected costs. Such uncertainties have been considered in estimating the provision. 
Remediation expenditure utilized provisions of $20 million, $19 million and
$21 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Note 13.Fair Value Measurements 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price. The Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured
and reported at fair value. The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These
inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavors to utilize the best available information. Accordingly, the
Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. The Company gives the
highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their
entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value 
84 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and
liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy Levels. In 2014, the Company evaluated the fair value hierarchy levels assigned to its assets and liabilities, and concluded that there should be no transfers into or out of Levels 1, 2
and 3.  The following table presents the carrying amount and fair
values of the Companys assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:  December31,2014 December31,2013 in millions

The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments: 
Cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments: The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of such
instruments.  Long-term debt: Long-term debt principally
comprises the revolving credit facility, which was entered into in December 2011 and term loans in our recently acquired Independence business. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates to the fair value. 
Acquisition-related contingent consideration: Deferred consideration
payable in cash is discounted to its fair value. Where deferred consideration is contingent upon pre-determined financial targets, an estimate of the fair value of the likely consideration payable is made. 
85 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives relating to interest rate swaps, foreign currency
forward exchange contracts and commodity swaps are derived from current settlement prices and comparable contracts using current assumptions. 
Foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily relate to contracts entered into to hedge future known transactions or hedge balance sheet net cash
positions. The movements in the carrying amounts and fair values of these contracts are largely due to changes in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. 
Stock equivalent units: The fair values of stock equivalent units are calculated at each balance sheet date using either the Black-Scholes or Monte
Carlo method. 
Note 14.Derivative Instruments and Risk Management 
The Company has limited involvement with derivative
instruments and does not trade them. The Company does use derivatives to manage certain interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and raw material cost exposures, as the need arises. As at December31, 2014 and December31, 2013 the
Company did not hold any interest rate or raw material derivatives. 
The Company enters into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts to minimize currency exchange rate exposure from expected future cash flows.
As at December31, 2014 the contracts have maturity dates of up to one year from the date of inception. These foreign currency forward exchange contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments, and their impact on the income statement
for 2014 was a gain of $34 million.  The Company sells a range of
Fuel Specialties, Performance Chemicals and Octane Additives to major oil refineries and chemical companies throughout the world. Credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are intended to minimize bad debt risk.
Collateral is not generally required. 
86 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued  Note 15.Commitments and Contingencies 
Operating leases
The Company has commitments under operating leases primarily
for office space, motor vehicles and various items of computer and office equipment. The leases are expected to be renewed and replaced in the normal course of business. Rental expense was $37 million in 2014, $31 million in 2013 and $29 million
in 2012. Future commitments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:  in millions 2015 41 2016 33 2017 28 2018 22 2019 12 Thereafter 25

Environmental remediation obligations 
Commitments in respect of environmental remediation obligations are disclosed
in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Contingencies 
Legal matters 
While we are involved from time to time in claims and legal proceedings that result from, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business including
business and commercial litigation, employee and product liability claims, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which any of their property is subject. It is possible
however, that an adverse resolution of an unexpectedly large number of such individual items could in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular year or quarter. 
Guarantees 
The Company and certain of the Companys consolidated subsidiaries are
contingently liable for certain obligations of affiliated companies primarily in the form of guarantees of debt and performance under contracts entered into as a normal business practice. This includes guarantees of non-U.S. excise taxes and customs
duties. As at December31, 2014, such guarantees which are not recognized as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements amounted to $30 million. 
87 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, generally the Company would be required to perform should
the affiliated company fail to fulfill its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements have recourse provisions that would enable the Company to recover any payments made under the terms of the guarantees from
securities held of the guaranteed parties assets.  The
Company and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Company.

Note 17.Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
Stock option plans
The Company has five active stock option plans, two of which
provide for the grant of stock options to employees, one provides for the grant of stock options to non-employee directors, and another provides for the grant of stock options to key executives on a matching basis provided they use a proportion of
their annual bonus to purchase common stock in the Company on the open market or from the Company. The fifth plan is a savings plan which provides for the grant of stock options to all Company employees provided they commit to make regular savings
over a pre-defined period which can then be used to purchase common stock upon vesting of the options. The stock options have vesting periods ranging from 24 months to 6 years and in all cases stock options granted expire within 10 years of the date
of grant. All grants are at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Grants may be priced at market value or at a premium or discount. The aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance which can
be granted under the plans is 2,640,000. 
88 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The fair value of stock options is measured on the grant date using either the Black-Scholes model, or
in cases where performance criteria are dependent upon external factors such as the Companys stock price, using a Monte Carlo model. The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the grant-date fair value of options:
2014 2013 2012 Dividend yield 134 011 000 Expected life 5years 5years 5years Volatility 307 411 601 Risk free interest rate 097 046 043  The following table summarizes the

At December31, 2014, there were 134,921
stock options that were exercisable, 51,001 had performance conditions attached.  The Companys policy is to issue shares from treasury stock to holders of stock options who exercise those options, but if sufficient treasury stock is not available, the Company will issue
previously unissued shares of stock to holders of stock options who exercise options.  The stock option compensation cost for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $26 million, $25 million and $31 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $09
million, $47 million and $15 million, respectively.  The total
compensation cost related to non-vested stock options not yet recognized at December31, 2014 was $47 million and this cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of 230 years. 
The cash tax benefit realized from stock option exercises totaled $09
million, $57 million and $27 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The excess tax benefit classified in financing activities was $04 million, $38 million and $22 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
89 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
No stock options awards were modified in 2014, 2013 or 2012. 
Stock equivalent units 
The Company awards Stock Equivalent Units SEUs from time to
time as a long-term performance incentive. SEUs are cash settled equity instruments conditional on certain performance criteria and linked to the Innospec Inc. share price. SEUs have vesting periods ranging from 11 months to 4 years and in all cases
SEUs granted expire within 10 years of the date of grant. Grants may be priced at market value or at a premium or discount. There is no limit to the number of SEUs that can be granted. As at December31, 2014 the liability for SEUs of $72
million is located in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets until they are cash settled.  The fair value of SEUs is measured at the balance sheet date using either the Black-Scholes model, or in cases where performance criteria are dependent upon external factors such as the Companys
stock price, using a Monte Carlo model. The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of SEUs at the balance sheet dates:  2014 2013 2012 Dividend yield 129 108 000 Volatility 260 376 438 Risk free interest rate 110 078 036  The following table summarizes the

At December31, 2014, there were 91,226
SEUs that were exercisable, 79,868 had performance conditions attached.  The charges for SEUs are spread over the life of the award subject to a revaluation to fair value each quarter. The revaluation may result in a charge or a credit to the income statement in the quarter
dependent upon our share price and other performance criteria. 
90 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The SEU compensation cost for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $20 million, $71 million and $68 million,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of SEUs exercised in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $37 million, $22 million and $13 million, respectively. 
The weighted-average remaining vesting period of non-vested SEUs is 117 years. 
Additional exceptional long-term
incentive plan  In the first quarter of 2014, Innospec
implemented an additional exceptional long-term incentive plan to reward selected executives with a cash bonus for delivering exceptional performance. One of the elements of the plan is payable only if the Innospec share performance matches or
out-performs that of competitors, as measured by the Russell 2000 Index, over the performance period January1, 2014 to December31, 2016.The maximum cash bonus payable under this element of the plan is $3 million and is accounted
for as share-based compensation. As such, the fair value of these liability cash-settled long-term incentives is calculated on a quarterly basis. The fair value is calculated using a Monte Carlo model and is summarized as follows:  in millions

Note 19.Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the FASB issued
ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASU 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU
will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2016. Early application is not
permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company
has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting.

Controls and Procedures 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Based on an evaluation carried out as of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were not effective as
of December31, 2014 due to the material weakness described below.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting within the meaning of Rule 13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  Due to its inherent limitations, management does not believe that internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors or fraud. In addition, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

On October 27, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in Independence Oilfield
Chemicals LLC Independence. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting Independences internal control over financial reporting associated with
total assets of $2347 million of which $1508 million represents goodwill and other intangibles included within the scope of the assessment and total revenues of $350 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of
and for the year ended December31, 2014.  Based on criteria
in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the evaluation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 due to the material weakness described below. 
Treatment of Intercompany Loans Denominated in Currencies Other Than the
Entitys Functional Currency:  The Company lacked
effective controls to ensure the proper application of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, related to the treatment of foreign currency gains or losses on intercompany loan balances denominated in currencies other than the entitys
functional currency. According to ASC 830, intercompany loans, denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are re-measured on a periodic basis with resulting gains or losses recorded to the consolidated statement of
income. If settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future, then foreign currency exchange gains and losses are to be recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income within the equity section of the balance sheet, as the
transactions and balances are considered to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company determined it was incorrectly calculating foreign exchange on intercompany loan balances and incorrectly including gains and losses in other
income/expense in the consolidated statement of income rather than accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements. The Company did not maintain effective internal control over the calculation of intercompany
foreign currency exchange gains or losses and lacked an effective control to assess and document at inception whether or not intercompany loan balances are long-term in nature. The ineffectiveness of the control environment did not result in an
adjustment to the current year financial statements or a restatement of prior year financial statements.  Our independent registered public accounting firm KPMG Audit Plc, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2014. Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company is currently engaged in carrying out its remediation plan which includes the following:  Performing a review and confirmation of the correct evaluation and documentation of certain intercompany loans including improving the processes and
controls to ensure proper application of ASC 830; 
94 Table of Contents Implementing additional procedures to ensure the calculation of foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans to be included in other
comprehensive income are correct.  Although the
Company has made progress in this area, additional steps need to be taken, as indicated above, and sufficient time needs to elapse before management can conclude that newly implemented controls are operating effectively and that the material
weakness has been adequately remediated.  Changes in Internal
Controls over Financial Reporting  The Company is continuously
seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and of its internal controls. This is intended to result in refinements to processes throughout the Company. As previously disclosed, we are continuing with the process of
developing a new, company-wide, information system platform which began in 2011.The platform provider is well established in the market.The implementation is a phased, risk-managed, site deployment following a multistage user acceptance
program with the existing platform providing a fallback position. We implemented the new platform at the majority of our U.S. sites in the third quarter of 2013. Our next phase of implementation includes the majority of reporting units outside of
the U.S. and is planned for the fourth quarter of 2015. In connection with this implementation, the Company has updated its internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to its business processes and
accounting procedures. As a consequence, none of the changes which were identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph dof Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B
