REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Yahoo! Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Yahoo! Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
THE COMPANY. Yahoo! Inc. Yahoo! or the Company is a global Internet
media company that offers a branded network of comprehensive information,
communication, and shopping services to millions of users daily. The Company was
incorporated in California on March 5, 1995 and commenced operations on that
date. The Company conducts its business within one industry segment.
On October 20, 1998 and 1997, the Company consummated its acquisitions of
Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. Yoyodyne and Four11 Corporation Four11,
respectively, upon which Yoyodyne and Four11 shareholders exchanged all of
their shares for shares of the Company Common Stock in business combinations
that were accounted for as pooling of interests. The consolidated financial
statements for the three years ended December 31, 1998 and the accompanying
notes reflect the Company financial position and the results of operations as
if Yoyodyne and Four11 were wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company since
inception.
Components of the consolidated results of operations of Yahoo! and of Four11
and Yoyodyne prior to their acquisitions by Yahoo! are as follows in
thousands:

STOCK SPLITS. During July 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one Common Stock split. Shareholders of record on July 17, 1998 the
record date received one additional share for every share held on that date.
The shares were distributed on July 31, 1998 and the stock split was effective
on August 3, 1998. During January 1999, the Company Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one Common Stock split. Shareholders of record on January 22,
1999 the record date received one additional share for every share held on
that date. The shares were distributed on February 5, 1999 and the stock split
was effective on February 8, 1999. All share numbers in these consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto for all periods presented have been
adjusted to reflect the two-for-one common stock splits.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Yahoo! Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The equity and net
loss attributable to the minority shareholder interests that related to the
Company subsidiaries, are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheets
and consolidated statements of operations, respectively. Losses in excess of the
minority interest equity would be charged against the Company. Investments in
entities owned 20% or more but less than
44
YAHOO! INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
majority owned and not otherwise controlled by the Company are accounted for
under the equity method.
RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior years' balances have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Company revenues are derived principally from
the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. The Company standard rates
for banner advertising currently range from approximately $600 per thousand
impressions for run of network to approximately $9000 per thousand impressions
for highly targeted audiences and properties. To date, the duration of the
Company banner advertising commitments has ranged from one week to two years.
Sponsorship advertising contracts have longer terms ranging from three months
to two years than standard banner advertising contracts and also involve more
integration with Yahoo! services, such as the placement of buttons that provide
users with direct links to the advertiser Web site. Advertising revenues on
both banner and sponsorship contracts are recognized ratably over the period in
which the advertisement is displayed, provided that no significant Company
obligations remain at the end of a period and collection of the resulting
receivable is probable. Company obligations typically include guarantees of
minimum number of impressions, or times that an advertisement appears in pages
viewed by users of the Company online properties. To the extent minimum
guaranteed impressions are not met, the Company defers recognition of the
corresponding revenues until the remaining guaranteed impression levels are
achieved.
The Company also earns revenue on sponsorship contracts from fees relating
to the design, coordination, and integration of customers' content and links
into Yahoo! online media properties. These development fees are recognized as
revenue once the related activities have been performed and the customer Web
links are available on Yahoo! online media properties. A number of the Company
agreements provide that Yahoo! receive revenues from electronic commerce
transactions. Currently, these revenues are recognized by the Company upon
notification from the advertiser of revenues earned by Yahoo!. Revenues from
barter transactions are recognized during the period in which the advertisements
are displayed in Yahoo! properties. Barter transactions are recorded at the fair
value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily
determinable in the circumstances. To date, revenues from development fees,
electronic commerce transactions, and barter transactions have each been less
than 10% of net revenues.
No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during 1998 and
1997, and SOFTBANK and its related companies SOFTBANK, a holder of
approximately 30% of the Company Common Stock at December 31, 1998, accounted
for 11% of net revenues during 1996 see Note 4.
Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of billings in excess of recognized
revenue relating to advertising contracts and payments received pursuant to
sponsorship advertising contracts in advance of revenue recognition.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. Costs incurred in the classification and organization
of listings within Yahoo! properties and the development of new products and
enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred. Material
software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility are capitalized. Based upon the Company product development
process,
45
YAHOO! INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model.
Costs incurred by the Company between completion of the working model and the
point at which the product is ready for general release have been insignificant.
ADVERTISING COSTS. Advertising production costs are recorded as expense the
first time an advertisement appears. All other advertising costs are expensed as
incurred. The Company does not incur any direct-response advertising costs.
Advertising expense totaled approximately $327 million, $109 million, and $42
million for 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
BENEFIT PLAN. The Company maintains a 401k Profit Sharing Plan the
Plan for its full-time employees. Each participant in the Plan may elect to
contribute from 1% to 17% of his or her annual compensation to the Plan. The
Company matches employee contributions at a rate of 25%. Employee contributions
are fully vested, whereas vesting in matching Company contributions occurs at a
rate of 333% per year of employment. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company
contributions amounted to $584,000, $263,000, and $81,000, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. The Company
invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its
agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers. All highly liquid instruments
with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash
equivalents, those with original maturities greater than three months and
current maturities less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are
considered short-term investments, and those with maturities greater than twelve
months from the balance sheet date are considered long-term investments.
The Company marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale as
of the balance sheet date and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses, net of tax, recorded in shareholders' equity. Realized gains or
losses and permanent declines in value, if any, on available-for-sale securities
will be reported in other income or expense as incurred. As of December 31,
1998, the Company recorded net unrealized gains, net of income taxes, of $218
million.
The Company invests in equity instruments of privately-held, information
technology companies for business and strategic purposes. These investments are
included in other long-term assets and are accounted for under the cost method
when ownership is less than 20%. For these non-quoted investments, the Company
policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating
performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values. The
Company identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived assets when
events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. To date,
no such impairment has been recorded. During 1998, certain of these investments
in privately-held companies became marketable equity securities when the
investees completed initial public offerings. Such investments, which are in the
Internet industry, are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value
due to the volatility of the stock market, and are recorded as long-term
investments.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist
primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, and
accounts receivable. Substantially all of the Company cash, cash equivalents,
and short and long-term investments are managed by four financial institutions.
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned
from customers primarily located in the

United States. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and maintains reserves for potential credit losses; historically, such losses
have been within management expectations. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, no
one customer accounted for 10% or more of the accounts receivable balance.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Property and equipment, including leasehold
improvements, are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are included in other assets and are
carried at cost less accumulated amortization, which is being provided on a
straight-line basis over the economic lives of the respective assets, generally
three to seven years. The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of
its long-lived assets based on expected undiscounted cash flows and recognizes
impairments, if any, based on expected discounted future cash flows.
INCOME TAXES. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the
currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the
amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not
expected to be realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS' No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB 25, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting
period based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the fair
value of the Company stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the
stock.
FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. The functional currency of
the Company international subsidiaries is the local currency. The financial
statements of these subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars using
year-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of
exchange for the year for revenues, costs, and expenses. Translation gains
losses, which are deferred and accumulated as a component of shareholders'
equity, were $288,000, $380,000, and $63,000 for 1998, 1997, and 1996,
respectively. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions
are included in the consolidated statements of operations and were not
significant during the periods presented. International revenues have accounted
for less than 10% of net revenues in the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997,
and 1996. International assets were not significant at December 31, 1998, 1997,
or 1996.
BASIC AND DILUTED NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE. Basic net income loss per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the incremental common
shares issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock using the
if-converted method and shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
warrants using the treasury stock method. For 1998, common equivalent shares
primarily related to shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
approximated 400 million shares. Common equivalent shares in 1997 and 1996 were
excluded from the computation as their effect was anti-dilutive.

NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which was
adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 1998. SFAS 130 establishes
standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in a financial
statement. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity net
assets during a period from non-owner sources. Examples of items to be included
in comprehensive income, which are excluded from net income, include foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities. Accumulated other comprehensive income, as
presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consists of the net
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, net of tax and the cumulative
translation adjustment.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and
hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging
activities, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. The
Company is currently determining the additional disclosures, if any, that may be
required under this pronouncement. In March 1998, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. This standard requires companies to capitalize qualifying
computer software costs which are incurred during the application development
stage and amortize them over the software estimated useful life. SOP 98-1 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of SOP 98-1 on its financial statements and
related disclosures.

NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company recognized net revenues of
approximately $103 million, $31 million, and $24 million, respectively, on
advertising contracts and publication, development, and licensing arrangements
with SOFTBANK and its related companies such as E*Trade Group, Inc., Kingston
Technology Company, and E-Loan, Inc., a holder of approximately 30% of the
Company Common Stock at December 31, 1998. Prices on these contracts were
comparable to those given to other similar customers of the Company.
Additionally, three SOFTBANK-related companies provided Internet access and
sales and marketing-related services for fees of approximately $31 million 32 million, and $23 million during 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively.
Sequoia Capital, a holder of approximately 3% of the Company Common Stock at
December 31, 1998, was also an investor in one of these SOFTBANK-related
companies.
NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS
ACQUISITION OF NETCONTROLS. On July 31, 1997, the Company entered into a
stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of
NetControls, Inc. for 148,668 shares of the Company Common Stock. The
acquisition was recorded as a purchase for accounting purposes and the majority
of the purchase price of approximately $14 million is being amortized over the
three-year estimated useful life of the technology acquired. Upon acquisition,
the historical financial results of NetControls, Inc. were de minimis.
ACQUISITION OF FOUR11. On October 20, 1997, the Company completed the
acquisition of Four11 Corporation, a privately-held online communications and
Internet directory company. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 6,022,880 shares
of Yahoo! Common Stock for all of Four11 outstanding shares and assumed
593,344 options and warrants to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock. All outstanding
Four11 preferred shares were converted into Four11 common stock immediately
prior to the acquisition. During the quarter ended December 31, 1997, the
Company recorded a one-time charge of $39 million for acquisition-related
costs. These costs consisted of investment banking fees, legal and accounting
fees, redundancy costs, and certain other expenses directly related to the
acquisition.

NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
ACQUISITION OF VIAWEB INC. On June 10, 1998, the Company completed the
acquisition of all outstanding shares of Viaweb, a provider of software and
services for hosting online stores, through the issuance of 1,574,364 shares of
Yahoo! Common Stock. All outstanding options to purchase Viaweb common stock
were converted into options to purchase 244,504 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with the
provisions of APB 16. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase
price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Results of operations for
Viaweb have been included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to
the date of acquisition.
The total purchase price of the acquisition was $486 million including
acquisition expenses of $18 million. The purchase price was allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as
determined by the Company and pursuant to discussions with the Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission the Staff as follows in thousands:
In-process research and  $ 15,000
Purchased    15,000
24,332
Tangible assets     571
Liabilities     344
Deferred tax    6,000
$ 48,559
Among the factors considered in discussions with the Staff in determining
the amount of the allocation of the purchase price to in-process research and
development were various factors such as estimating the stage of development of
each in-process research and development project at the date of acquisition,
estimating cash flows resulting from the expected revenues generated from such
projects, and discounting the net cash flows, in addition to other assumptions.
The remaining identified intangibles, including the value of purchased
technology and other intangibles will be amortized on a straight-line basis over
three and seven years, respectively. Amortization expense of purchased
technology and other intangible assets was $29 million and $20 million,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1998. A deferred tax liability has
been recognized for the difference between the assigned values for book purposes
and the tax bases of assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 109. In
addition, other factors were considered in discussions with the Staff in
determining the value assigned to purchased in-process technology such as
research projects in areas supporting the online store technology including
significant enhancement to the ability of the product to support multiple users
and multiple servers, developing functionality to support the ability to
process credit card orders, and enhancing the product user interface by
developing functionality that would allow the product to be used outside of the
United States. If none of these projects is successfully developed, the
Company sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods.
Additionally, the failure of any particular individual project in process could
impair the value of other intangible assets acquired. The Company began to
benefit from the purchased in-process technology in late 1998.
ACQUISITION OF WEBCAL CORPORATION. On July 17, 1998, the Company completed
the acquisition of WebCal Corporation WebCal, a privately-held developer and
marketer of Web-based calendaring
51
YAHOO! INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 5 ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
and scheduling products, and publisher of EventCal, a comprehensive database of
world-wide public events. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 541,908 shares of
Yahoo! Common Stock for all of WebCal outstanding shares. The historical
operations of WebCal are not material to the Company financial position or
results of operations, therefore, prior period financial statements have not
been restated for this acquisition. WebCal accumulated deficit on July 17,
1998 was $11 million. Net revenues and pre-tax net loss for WebCal in 1998
through the date of the acquisition approximated $2,000 and $847,000,
respectively.
ACQUISITION OF YOYODYNE ENTERTAINMENT, INC. On October 20, 1998, the
Company acquired Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc., a privately-held, direct
marketing services company. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was
accounted for as a pooling of interests, the Company exchanged 561,244 shares of
Yahoo! Common Stock and options and warrants to purchase Yahoo! Common Stock for
all of Yoyodyne outstanding shares, options, and warrants. The consolidated
financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 1998 and the
accompanying notes reflect the Company financial position and the results of
operations as if Yoyodyne was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company since
inception. During October 1998, the Company recorded a one-time charge of $21
million for acquisition-related costs. These costs consisted of broker fees,
legal and accounting fees, and certain other expenses directly related to the
acquisition.
ACQUISITION OF HYPERPARALLEL, INC. On December 17, 1998, the Company
completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of HyperParallel, Inc.
HyperParallel, a direct marketing company specializing in data analysis,
through the issuance of 74,856 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock and cash, totaling
$81 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with
APB 16. Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
values at the date of the acquisition. The excess purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been
allocated to goodwill. Results of operations for HyperParallel have been
included with those of the Company for periods subsequent to the date of
acquisition. The Company estimated that the economic useful lives of current
technology and goodwill were three and seven years, respectively.
The Company recorded a charge to earnings of $23 million for in-process
research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and
had no alternative future use. Factors considered in estimating the allocation
of purchase price to in-process research and development were estimating cash
flows resulting from the expected revenues to be generated from the project, and
discounting the net cash flows, in addition to other assumptions. If this
project is not successfully developed, the Company sales and profitability may
be adversely affected in future periods.

NOTE 6 JOINT VENTURES
YAHOO! JAPAN. During April 1996, the Company signed a joint venture
agreement with SOFTBANK whereby Yahoo! Japan Corporation was formed to establish
and manage in Japan a Japanese version of the Yahoo! Internet Guide, develop
related Japanese online navigational services, and conduct other related
business. The Company ownership interest in the joint venture upon inception
was 40%. During November 1997, Yahoo! Japan Corporation completed its initial
public offering, issuing 975 previously unissued shares and raising total
proceeds of approximately $55 million. Accordingly, the Company increased its
investment by $17 million, recorded as additional paid-in capital, to reflect
the increase in the Company share of Yahoo! Japan Corporation net assets.
The investment is being accounted for using the equity method and the Company
share of net income, to date, has been immaterial. At December 31, 1998, the
carrying value of the investment was $29 million and is recorded in other
assets. However, the fair value of the Company 34% ownership in Yahoo! Japan,
based on the quoted trading price, was approximately $170 million at December
31, 1998.
YAHOO! EUROPE. On November 1, 1996, the Company signed a joint venture
agreement with a subsidiary of SOFTBANK whereby separate companies were formed
in Germany, the United Kingdom, and France Yahoo! Europe to establish and
manage versions of the Yahoo! Internet Guide for those countries, develop
related online navigational services, and conduct other related business. The
parties have invested a total of $60 million in proportion to their respective
equity interests as of December 31, 1998. The Company has a majority share of
approximately 70% in each of the Yahoo! Europe entities, and therefore, has
consolidated their financial results. During 1998, 1997, and 1996, Yahoo! Europe
incurred losses from operations of $409,000, $1,807,000 and $842,000,
respectively. SOFTBANK interest in the net assets of Yahoo! Europe at December
31, 1998 and 1997, as represented by the minority interest on the balance sheet,
was $883,000 and $405,000, respectively.
YAHOO! KOREA. During August 1997, the Company signed a joint venture
agreement with SOFTBANK and other SOFTBANK affiliate companies whereby Yahoo!
Korea was formed to develop and operate a Korean version of the Yahoo! Internet
Guide, develop related Korean online navigational services, and conduct other
related business. The parties have invested a total of $10 million in
proportion to their respective equity interests. The Company has a majority
share of approximately 60% in the joint venture, and therefore, has consolidated
the financial results, which

have been insignificant to date. SOFTBANK interest in the net assets of Yahoo!
Korea at December 31, 1998 and 1997, as represented by the minority interest on
the balance sheet, was $365,000 and $311,000, respectively.
YAHOO! MARKETPLACE. On August 26, 1996, the Company entered into agreements
with Visa International Service Association VISA and another party
together, the Visa Group to establish a limited liability company, Yahoo!
Marketplace L.L.C., to develop and operate a navigational service focused on
information and resources for the purchase of consumer products and services
over the Internet. As of December 31, 1996, the parties had invested a total of
$10 million. At December 31, 1996, the Company owned approximately 55% of the
equity interest in Yahoo! Marketplace. Yahoo! Marketplace incurred start-up
losses of $246,000 in 1997 and $637,000 in 1996. During July 1997, prior to the
completion of significant business activities and public launch of the property,
the Company and VISA entered into an agreement under which the Visa Group
released the Company from certain obligations and claims. In connection with
this agreement, the Company issued 2,797,924 shares of Yahoo! Common Stock to
the Visa Group, for which the Company recorded a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax
charge of $212 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 1997.
NOTE 7 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
COMMON STOCK. On April 11, 1996, the Company completed its initial public
offering of 179 million shares of its Common Stock. Net proceeds to the Company
aggregated $351 million. As of the closing date of the offering, all of the
Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding was converted into an aggregate of
approximately 77 million shares of Common Stock. On July 14, 1998, the Company
received proceeds of $2500 million in exchange for 5,453,760 newly issued
shares of Yahoo! Common Stock through a private placement with SOFTBANK. The
shares purchased by SOFTBANK are subject to a pre-existing agreement, entered
into in 1996, that prohibits SOFTBANK from purchasing additional shares of the
Company capital stock if such purchase would result in SOFTBANK owning more
than 35% of the Company capital stock assuming the exercise of all
outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock.
STOCK OPTION PLANS. Pursuant to the consummation of the acquisitions of
Viaweb Inc. and Yoyodyne Entertainment, Inc. during 1998, the Company assumed
the Viaweb 1997 Stock Option Plan the Viaweb Plan and the 1996 Yoyodyne
Stock Option Plan the Yoyodyne Plan, respectively. As of December 31, 1998,
the Company had five stock-based compensation plans which are described below.
The 1995 Stock Plan the Stock Plan, the 1995 Four11 Stock Option Plan
the Four11 Plan, the Viaweb Plan, and the Yoyodyne Plan collectively the
Plans allow for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, and stock purchase rights to purchase a maximum of 876 million shares
of the Company Common Stock. Under the Plans, incentive stock options may be
granted to employees, directors, and officers of the Company and non-qualified
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to consultants,
employees, directors, and officers of the Company. Options granted under the
Plans are for periods not to exceed ten years, and must be issued at prices not
less than 100% and 85%, for incentive and nonqualified stock options,
respectively, of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant as
determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted to shareholders who own
greater than 10% of the outstanding stock are for periods not to exceed five
years and must be issued at prices not less than 110% of the fair market value

on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted
under the Stock Plan and the Four11 Plan generally vest 25% after the first year
of service and ratably each month over the remaining thirty-six month period.
Options granted under the Viaweb Plan generally vest 25% on each anniversary
over four years. Options granted under the Yoyodyne Plan have various vesting
periods that do not exceed thirty-six months. Options issued under the Four11
Plan may be exercised prior to vesting and are subject to repurchase in the
event of a voluntary termination, at the original purchase price. At December
31, 1998, shares subject to repurchase under the provisions of the Four11 Plan
were insignificant.
The 1996 Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors' Plan provides for
the issuance of up to 12 million non-statutory stock options to non-employee
directors of the Company. Each person who becomes a non-employee director of the
Company after the date of the Company initial public offering will
automatically be granted a non-statutory option the First Option to purchase
240,000 shares of Common Stock upon the date on which such person first becomes
a director. Thereafter, each director of the Company will be granted an annual
option the Annual Option to purchase 30,000 shares of Common Stock. Options
under the Directors' Plan will be granted at the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors and will vest in
equal monthly installments over four years, in the case of the First Option, or
at the end of four years in the case of the Annual Option. Options granted under
the Directors' Plan are for periods not to exceed 10 years.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. Effective March 6, 1996, the Company Board
of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan,
which provides for the issuance of a maximum of 1,800,000 shares of Common
Stock. Eligible employees can have up to 15% of their earnings withheld, up to
certain maximums, to be used to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock on
every December 31st and June 30th. The price of the Common Stock purchased
under the Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
value of the Common Stock on the commencement date of each six-month offering
period or the specified purchase date. During 1998, 126,000 shares were
purchased at prices from $1472 to $3610 per share. During 1997, 537,000 shares
were purchased at prices from $185 to $483 per share. There were no shares

Prior to the Company initial public offering, the fair value of each
option grant was determined on the date of grant using the minimum value method.
Subsequent to the offering, the fair value was determined using the
Black-Scholes model. The weighted average fair market value of an option granted
during 1998, 1997, and 1996 was $2653, $434, and $079, respectively. Except
for the volatility assumption which was only used under the Black-Scholes model,
the following range of assumptions was used to perform the calculations:
expected life of 36 months in 1998 and 1997, and 30 months in 1996; risk-free
interest rate ranges of 42% to 56% during 1998, 56% to 66% during 1997, and
51% to 65% during 1996; expected volatility of 67% in 1998, 59% in 1997, and
53% in 1996; and no expected dividend yield for the three years ended December
31, 1998. Because additional stock options are expected to be granted each year,
the above pro forma disclosures are not representative of pro forma effects on
reported financial results for future years.

As of December 31, 1998, the Company federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $333 million and $181
million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010, and the state net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2003. The Company federal and state
research tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes are approximately
$107 million and $101 million, respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. Approximately $13 million of
net operating loss carryforwards relate to acquired entities and expire
beginning in 2010. Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be
limited by a cumulative stock ownership change of more than 50%, or by other
limitations.
Deferred tax assets of approximately $141 million as of December 31, 1998
pertain to certain net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards
resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. When recognized, the tax
benefit of these loss and credit carryforwards are accounted for as a credit to
additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision.
Deferred tax assets include approximately $16 million related to net operating
loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions. These carryforwards will
expire if not utilized.
