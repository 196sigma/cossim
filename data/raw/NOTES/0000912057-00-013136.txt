To the Shareholders of F.Y.I. Incorporated    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of F.Y.I.
Incorporated a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of
December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
F.Y.I. Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION     F.Y.I. Incorporated the Company or F.Y.I. was founded in
September 1994, to create a national, single source provider of document and
information outsourcing solutions to document and information intensive
industries, including: healthcare, law, banking, insurance, retailing, high tech
manufacturing and government. We acquired seven document management services
businesses the Founding Companies simultaneously with the closing of our
initial public offering the IPO on January 26, 1996, and effectively began
operations at that time. The consideration for the Founding Companies consisted
of a combination of cash and common stock the Common Stock of our Company.
Since the IPO, we acquired nine companies in transactions that were
accounted for as poolings-of-interests: i The Rust Consulting Group, Inc.
Rust in December 1996; ii MAVRICC Management Systems, Inc. and a related
company, MMS Escrow and Transfer Agency, Inc. collectively, MAVRICC in March
1997; iii Input of Texas, Inc. Input in March 1997; iv Micro Publishing
Systems, Inc. MPS in December 1997; v Lifo Systems, Inc. Lifo in
February 1998; vi Creative Mailings, Inc. CMI in September 1998; vii
Economic Research Services ERS in October 1998; viii TCH Mailhouse, Inc.
and G Enterprise, Inc. collectively, TCH; in December 1998; and ix
Advanced Digital Graphics, Inc. ADG in December 1998 collectively, the
Pooled Companies. The consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented have been restated to include the accounts of MAVRICC, Input, CMI and
ERS. Our consolidated financial statements were not restated for the Rust, MPS,
and Lifo acquisitions for the periods prior to January 1, 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively, due to their financial immateriality. Periods presented were also
not restated prior to October 1, 1998, for the acquisitions of TCH and ADG due
to their financial immateriality. The Pooled Companies and our Company were not
under common control or management during the periods prior to their respective
mergers. The results of operations for the periods presented may not be
indicative of the results in the future because of i the impact of
acquisitions recorded as purchases, whose results are only included subsequent
to the purchase date; and ii the impact of acquisitions recorded as
poolings-of-interests, whose predecessor companies were not under common control
or management.
Subsequent to the IPO and through December 31, 1999, we acquired 45
additional companies in transactions accounted for as purchases. Our results of
operations include the results of these acquisitions from the date of their
respective acquisitions.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost,
which approximates market value.
FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Our functional currency and that of all of our operating companies is
the U.S. dollar. Certain of our operating companies conduct transactions in
foreign currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded
as other income and expense on the income statement.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the estimated
useful life or the term of the lease. 27 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist primarily of excess purchase price over net
assets, which are amortized over periods not to exceed 30 years. In conformance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of, our management continually evaluates whether events and circumstances
indicate the remaining estimated useful life of intangible assets may warrant
revisions or that the remaining balance of intangibles or other long-lived
assets may not be recoverable. To make this evaluation, management uses an
estimate of undiscounted net income over the remaining life of the intangibles
or other long-lived assets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized when the services are rendered, or products are
delivered to our customers. Unearned revenue represents certain services which
are billed in advance.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method
pursuant to SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are
recognized for tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted
statutory tax rates applicable in future years to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per common share has been computed in accordance with SFAS
No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which requires the disclosure of basic and
diluted net income per share. Basic net income per share has been computed by
dividing income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for
the period. Diluted net income per share has been computed by dividing income by
the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents
outstanding for the period.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP requires our management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to make their
presentation consistent with the current year.
CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of F.Y.I. Incorporated and our
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated.
PRO FORMA NET INCOME UNAUDITED
We acquired the Pooled Companies in transactions that were accounted
for as poolings-of-interests. The Pooled Companies were managed through their
acquisition dates as independent private companies and represent a variety of
tax structures. Therefore, selling, general and administrative expenses for the
historical periods reflect compensation and related benefits that the former
owners have received from the business during those periods. In connection with
the acquisitions, the owners may have entered into employment agreements that
provide for
28 compensation and benefits at levels lower than the historical amounts the
Compensation Differential. The unaudited pro forma data present
compensation at the level the owners have agreed to receive subsequent to the
acquisition. In addition, the pro forma data presents the incremental
provision for income taxes as if all entities had been subject to federal and
state income taxes and the related income tax impact of the Compensation
Differential discussed above.

subject to adjustments in their overall consideration based upon performance
against specified earning targets over one to three year periods. 1998 ACQUISITIONS
During 1998, we acquired 13 document management businesses, eight of which
were accounted for as purchases the Purchased Companies and five of which
were accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method. The eight acquisitions
accounted for as purchases were Medicopy, Inc. Medicopy, Associate Record
Technician Services, Inc. ARTS, DeBari Associates, Inc. DeBari, ACT
Medical Record Services, Inc. ACT, Eagle Legal Services, Inc. Eagle,
Doctex, Inc. Doctex, Copyright, Inc. Copyright, and certain assets of
Olicon Imaging Systems, Inc. Radiology. The aggregate consideration paid
for the Purchased Companies consisted of $1872 million in cash and 644,762
shares of common stock. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is
set forth below in thousands

The estimated fair market values reflected above are based on
preliminary estimates and assumptions and are subject to revision. In
management opinion, the preliminary allocations are not expected to be
materially different than the final allocations. Certain of the acquisitions are
subject to additional consideration based upon achievement of specified earning
targets over a one to three year period.
The acquisitions of CMI in September 1998 and ERS in October 1998
for 745,000 and 835,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were accounted
for as poolings-of-interests. The consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented have been restated to include the accounts of CMI and ERS.
Pro forma net income reflects adjustments for the Compensation Differential
and the related income tax effect and the incremental provision for income
taxes as if all entities had been subject to federal and state income taxes. 30     The acquisition of Lifo in February 1998 for 326,659 shares of common
stock was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Our consolidated financial
statements were not restated for periods prior to January 1, 1998, due to the
financial immateriality of Lifo.
The acquisitions of TCH and ADG in December 1998 for 416,524 shares of
common stock were accounted for as poolings-of-interests. Our consolidated
financial statements were not restated for periods prior to October 1, 1998, due
to the financial immateriality of TCH and ADG.
1998 DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER CHARGES
In October 1998, we entered into an agreement to exchange certain
assets and related liabilities of Leonard Archives Acquisition Corp.
Leonard for cash and certain assets and related liabilities of Copyright,
Inc., a Philadelphia-based provider of healthcare release of information
services. The divestiture of Leonard, which primarily offered archival records
storage, was consistent with our strategic objective of focusing our activities
on higher value-added document and information management and outsourcing
solutions. The book value of the net assets disposed was approximately $41
million, and we recorded a gain of $44 million on the transaction, net of costs
associated with the transaction.
Also in the fourth quarter, we recorded the write-down of certain
intangible and fixed assets and recorded severance and other costs. The goodwill
impairments related to the Computer Central Corporation, Microfilm Associates,
Ltd. and Octo, Inc. acquisitions and a customer list associated with a Founding
Company acquisition in which the customer base associated with the intangible
asset had deteriorated to the extent that the assets were considered impaired
under SFAS 121. The severance represented payments due on acquisition-related
employment contracts terminated or not renewed. The charges totaling $43
million are presented in the consolidated statement of operations as follows:
i acceleration of goodwill amortization, $18 million; ii accrual for
severance and other costs, $17 million; iii facilities closings costs, $05
million; and iv other write-downs and impairments, $03 million. The gain on
sale of the assets of Leonard, net of the above charges, was $145,000 before
taxes.
1997 ACQUISITIONS
During 1997, we acquired 11 document management businesses, eight of
which were accounted for as purchases and three of which were accounted for
under the pooling-of-interests method. The eight acquisitions accounted for as
purchases were Acadian Consultants, Inc., Computer Central Corporation,
Deliverex of San Francisco, Information Management Corporation, Major Legal
Services, Quality Copy Service, QCSInet, Inc. and affiliates, APS Services, and
ZipShred, Inc. and ZipShred of America, LLC. The aggregate consideration paid
for these eight acquisitions consisted of $95 million in cash and 737,935
shares of common stock. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is set
forth below in thousands                                      
Consideration   $21,248
Estimated Fair Value of Tangible    8,153
Estimated Fair Value of   11,932
25,027     The weighted average fair market values of the shares of common stock
used in calculating the consideration paid was $1679 per share which
represented a 30-35% discount from the average trading price of the common stock
based on the length and type of restrictions in the purchase agreements.
The acquisitions of MAVRICC and Input in March 1997, for 820,000 and
263,636 shares of common stock, respectively, were accounted for as
poolings-of-interests. The consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented have been restated to include the accounts of MAVRICC and Input.
The acquisition of MPS in December 1997, for 326,506 shares of common
stock was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Our consolidated financial
statements were not restated for periods prior to January 1, 1997, due to the
financial immateriality of MPS. 31 CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION
Certain of our acquisitions are subject to adjustments in their
overall consideration based upon the achievement of specified earning targets
over one to three year periods. During 1999, we paid consideration of $06
million in cash and 24,740 shares of common stock at an average price of
$3036 per share in relation to contingent consideration agreements that have
been settled. Based upon the evaluation of cumulative earnings through
December 31, 1999, against the specified earnings targets, we have accrued
aggregate contingent consideration of approximately $444 million, of which
$251 million is classified as accounts payable and accrued liabilities on
our balance sheet; the remaining $193 million is classified as other
long-term obligations. All of the periods applicable for the earnout targets
have not been completed, and the amounts paid at the conclusion are likely to
be different from amounts presently accrued.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
All intangibles are considered enterprise goodwill. Based on the
historical profitability of the purchased companies and trends in the legal,
healthcare and other industries to outsource document management functions in
the foreseeable future, the enterprise goodwill is being amortized over periods
not to exceed 30 years. Management continually evaluates whether events and
circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of intangible
assets may warrant revisions or that the remaining balance of intangibles or
other long-lived assets may not be recoverable. To make this evaluation,
management uses an estimate of undiscounted net income over the remaining life
of the intangibles or other long-lived assets. The goodwill associated with a
majority of our acquisitions is not deductible for income tax purposes.

In February 1998, we entered into a credit agreement the 1998 Credit
Agreement with Paribas and Bank of America Texas, N.A., as co-agents and
lenders named therein. Under the 1998 Credit Agreement, we and our subsidiaries
could borrow on a revolving credit basis loans in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount up to $650 million, subject to certain customary borrowing
capacity requirements. In April 1999 and August 1999, the 1998 Credit Agreement
was amended to increase the aggregate outstanding principal limit to $1000
million and $1250 million, respectively. In November 1999, we further amended
the 1998 Credit Agreement, increasing the aggregate principal limit to $1500
million. The 1998 Credit Agreement is secured by the assets and/or stock of our
Company and our subsidiaries. The availability under the 1998 Credit Agreement
as of December 31, 1999, was $557 million.
The commitment to fund revolving credit loans under the 1998 Credit
Agreement expires February 18, 2001. The annual interest rate applicable to
borrowings under this facility is, at our option, i the prime rate or ii
grid pricing ranging from 05% to 150% plus the Eurodollar rate based on the
ratio of debt to EBITDA as defined in the 1998 Credit Agreement. The 1998
Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances. The
outstanding principal balance of revolving credit loans is due and payable on
March 31, 2003.
We also have outstanding an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount
of approximately $23 million to serve as guarantee for periodic principal and
interest payments related to the Industrial Revenue Bonds. In January 1998, we
entered into a letter of credit in the amount of $100 million to serve as a
guarantee for performance under a contract with New York State Workers
Compensation Board. In April 1999, the amount of the letter of credit was
reduced to $50 million. Additionally, in November 1999, we entered into a
letter of credit in the amount of $50 million to serve as a guarantee for
performance under a contract with the New York State Teachers' Retirement
System.
We capitalized certain costs associated with our 1996 Credit Agreement.
The unamortized costs of approximately $12 million were expensed in the fourth
quarter of 1997 when we agreed to terms on the 1998 Credit Agreement.
The weighted average interest rate on long-term obligations at December
31, 1998 and 1999, was 60% and 64%, respectively. The 1998 Credit Agreement
contains certain reporting requirements and financial covenants, including
requirements that we maintain minimum levels of net worth and other financial
ratios. As of December 31, 1998, we had complied with all loan covenants. In the
fourth quarter of 1999 we exceeded our covenant for allowable capital
expenditures. We received a waiver for this covenant for the period ended
December 31, 1999. 33 MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS     At December 31, 1999, we had one stock-based compensation plan, the
1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended the Plan, which is described below. We
have also issued warrants the Warrants to certain key employees and
employees of our subsidiaries. We refer to these options and warrants
collectively as Awards. We apply APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations
in accounting for awards. Awards are granted at the market price of the
common stock on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the awards. Had compensation cost been determined based upon
the fair value at grant dates for these awards consistent with the method of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, our net income and
earnings per share would have been as follows in thousands, except for per
share data                                       DECEMBER 31,

Actual diluted net income per common share.       $105     $139     $160     The fair value of the Awards was estimated on the date of the grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for
1997: risk free interest rate ranging from 57% to 66%, no dividend yield 35 expected life of three years, and volatility of 33%. The following
assumptions were used for 1998: risk free interest rate ranging from 40% to
57%, no dividend yield, average expected life of three years, and volatility
of 40%. The following assumptions were used for 1999: risk free interest rate
ranging from 45% to 61%, no dividend yield, average expected life of three
years, and volatility of 35%.
In October 1995, our Board of Directors and our stockholders approved
the Plan, which became effective on the date of the IPO. The Plan provides
awards of options to purchase common stock and may include incentive stock
options ISOs and/or non-qualified stock options.
The Plan also provides for automatic option grants to directors who are
not otherwise employed by us or our subsidiaries. Upon commencement of service
or upon agreeing to serve in the case of the initial non-employee directors, a
non-employee director will receive a non-qualified option to purchase 10,000
shares of common stock, and continuing non-employee directors will receive
annual options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock. Options granted to
non-employee directors become exercisable one-third on the date of grant and
one-third on each of the next two anniversaries of the date of grant.
Non-employee directors' options have a term of five years from the date of
grant.
The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to
outstanding options under the Plan, determined immediately after the grant of
any option, is the greater of 650,000 shares or 16% of the aggregate number of
shares of our common stock outstanding provided, however, that options to
purchase no more than 650,000 shares of common stock may be granted as ISOs. At
December 31, 1998 and 1999, approximately 144,000 and 417,000 shares,
respectively, were available for issuance.
We had 2,814,284 and 2,830,410 Awards outstanding at December 31, 1998,
and 1999, respectively. These Awards, other than those granted to employee
directors, have 10-year expirations and various vesting schedules.                                        AWARDS OUTSTANDING

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS     We established a defined contribution plan the 401k plan in
January 1997. The 401k plan covers our employees and the employees of some
of our subsidiaries. The employees must be at least 21 years of age and work
at least 1,000 hours per year with one year of service to be eligible for the
plan. In addition, we established a non-qualified plan in December 1996. The
non-qualified compensation plan permits eligible officers and certain highly
compensated employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Contributions
to both the 401k plan and the non-qualified compensation plan consist of
employee pre-tax contributions determined as a percentage of each
participating employee compensation. We may make contributions to either or
both plans at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We have not made any
contributions to the 401k plan or the deferred compensation plan. We offer
no post-employment or post-retirement benefits.
Certain of the operating companies have qualified defined contribution
employee benefit plans the Plans, the majority of which allow for voluntary
pre-tax contributions by employees. The subsidiaries pay all general and
administrative expenses of the Plans and, in some cases, the subsidiaries make
matching and discretionary contributions to the Plans. The subsidiaries offer no
post-employment or post-retirement benefits. The expense incurred by us related
to the Plans was approximately $449,000, $610,000, and $887,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively.
12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS LEASING TRANSACTIONS
Certain of our operating companies lease their operating facilities,
along with certain equipment, from selling parties who remained our employees or
directors. These leases are for various lengths and annual amounts. The rental
expense for these operating leases for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998
and 1999 was approximately $834,000, $647,000 and $1,362,348, respectively. 37 NOTES RECEIVABLE
In the acquisition of the Founding Companies, we acquired $642,000 of
notes receivable from two Founding Company shareholders. When we effectively
began our operations, the shareholders entered into new notes receivable with a
stated interest rate 5% and principal payment schedules. Principal and
interest were paid in full by the shareholders in 1999 and early 2000.
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION
We are, from time to time, a party to litigation. Our management
believes that none of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade
receivables. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and certain other
financial instruments at various major financial institutions across many
geographic areas. Credit risk on trade receivables is minimized as a result of
the large number of entities comprising our client base and their dispersion
across many industries and geographic areas.
