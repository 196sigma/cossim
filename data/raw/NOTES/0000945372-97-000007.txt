REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS
TO SIGCORP, Inc.  We have audited the consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of SIGCORP, Inc.
an Indiana corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of
income, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These
financial statements and the supplemental schedule referred
to below are the responsibility of SIGCORP'S management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and supplemental schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of SIGCORP, Inc. as of December 31,
1996 and 1995, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 3, effective January 1, 1995,
SIGECO changed its method of accounting for unbilled
revenues.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. 
The supplemental schedule listed under Item 8 3 is
presented for the purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This supplemental schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits
of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Note 1  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
SIGCORP and SIGECO
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION Effective January 1, 1996, a
new holding company, SIGCORP, Inc. SIGCORP, became the
parent of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company
SIGECO, a regulated gas and electric utility which
accounts for over 90% of SIGCORP net income, and four of
SIGECO former wholly-owned subsidiaries: Energy Systems
Group, Inc. ESGI, Southern Indiana Minerals, Inc. SIMI,
Southern Indiana Properties, Inc.SIPI and ComSource, Inc.
ComSource. All of the shares of SIGECO common stock
were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of SIGCORP,
while all of SIGECO debt securities and all of its
outstanding shares of preferred stock remain securities of
SIGECO and are unaffected. During the fourth quarter of
1996, four additional nonregulated subsidiaries were formed:
SIGCORP Energy Services, Inc. Energy, SIGCORP Capital,
Inc. Capital, SIGCORP Fuels, Inc. Fuels and SIGCORP
Power Marketing, Inc. Power. 
SIGECO is a regulated gas and electric utility and engaged
principally in the production, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity and the delivery of
natural gas. SIGECO serves 122,195 electric customers in
the city of Evansville and 74 other communities and serves
106,237 gas customers in the city of Evansville and 64 other
communities.
ESGI provides equipment and related design services to
industrial and commercial customers. SIMI processes and
markets coal combustion by-products. SIPI invests
principally in partnerships primarily in real estate,
leveraged leases and marketable securities. ComSource
markets telecommunications services. Energy, incorporated
in October 1996, was established to provide natural gas,
pipeline management, storage service and other natural gas-
related services to SIGECO and other customers. Capital,
also incorporated in October 1996, will be the primary
financing vehicle for SIGCORP nonregulated subsidiaries. 
Fuels, incorporated in December 1996, was formed to provide
coal supply procurement and related services, such as
transportation of coal, to SIGECO and other customers. 
Power, incorporated in December 1996, was formed to procure
electric power supplies for SIGECO and other customers, and
will market SIGECO excess electric generation capacity. 
Because SIGECO is the principal subsidiary of SIGCORP, the
operating results of all nonregulated subsidiaries are
included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. All significant intercompany transactions are
eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
REGULATION The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission IURC
has jurisdiction over all investor-owned gas and electric
utilities in Indiana. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission FERC has jurisdiction over those investor-owned
utilities that make wholesale energy sales. These agencies
regulate SIGECO utility business operations, rates,
accounts, depreciation allowances, services, security issues
and the sale and acquisition of properties. The financial
statements of SIGECO are based on generally accepted
accounting principles, which give recognition to the
ratemaking and accounting practices of these agencies.
REGULATORY ASSETS SIGECO is subject to the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. 
Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to
SIGECO associated with certain incurred costs which will be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.  
SIGECO adopted SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of , on January 1, 1996. SFAS No. 121 requires
that impairment losses for long-lived assets and
identifiable intangibles to be held and used, be based on
the fair value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of should be
reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell. It also requires that regulatory assets which
are no longer probable of recovery through future
41
revenues, at the balance sheet date, be charged to earnings.
Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact
on financial position or results of operation.  The
following regulatory assets are reflected in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets At December 31 in thousands            1996   1995
Regulatory Assets:

Total long-term regulatory assets         $37,559  $39,958 Refer to the individual footnotes referenced above for
discussion of specific regulatory assets. See Income Taxes
for regulatory assets and liabilities related to income
taxes.
As of December 31, 1996, $33,800,000 of SIGECO total
regulatory assets are being reflected in rates charged to
customers over periods ranging from 5 to 28 years. SIGECO
intends to request recovery of its remaining regulatory
assets in a future general rate case filing.
If all or a separable portion of SIGECO operation becomes
no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71, a write
off of related regulatory assets would be required, unless
some form of transition cost recovery continues through
rates established and collected for SIGECO remaining
regulated operations. In addition, SIGECO would be required
to determine any impairment to the carrying costs of
deregulated plant and inventory assets.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  SIGECO customer receivables
from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services
are primarily derived from a broadly diversified base of
residential, commercial and industrial customers located in
a southwestern region of Indiana. SIGECO continually
reviews customers' creditworthiness and requests deposits or
refunds deposits based on that review. See Note 4 for a
discussion of receivables related to its leveraged lease
investments.
UTILITY PLANT Utility plant is stated at the historical
original cost of construction. The cost of repairs and
minor renewals is charged to maintenance expense as
incurred. Property unit replacements are capitalized and
the depreciation reserve is charged with the cost, less net
salvage, of units retired.
DEPRECIATION Depreciation of utility plant is provided

defined benefit plans which cover eligible full-time regular
employees. The plans provide retirement benefits based on
years of service and the employee highest 60 consecutive
months' compensation during the last 120 months of
employment. The funding policy of SIGECO is to contribute
amounts to the plans equal to at least the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 ERISA but not in excess of the maximum deductible
for federal income tax purposes. The plans' assets as of
December 31, 1996 consist of investments in interest-bearing
obligations and common stocks of 47% and 53%, respectively.
The components of net pension cost related to these plans
are as follows Year Ended December 31 in thousands    1996   1995   1994

Accrued pension liability          $ 4,876  $ 3,702 The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1996 and
1995 was determined using an assumed discount rate 
of 7%. For both periods, the long-term rate of compensation
increases was assumed to be 5%, and the long-term rate of
return on plan assets was assumed to be 8%. The
transitional asset is being amortized over approximately 15,
18 and 14 years for the Salaried, Hourly and Hoosier plans,
respectively.
In addition to the trusteed pension plans discussed above,
SIGECO provides supplemental pension benefits to certain
current and former officers under nonqualified and nonfunded
plans. Annual service cost related to these benefits is
approximately $240,000.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS SIGECO provides
certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees and their dependents through
fully insured plans. SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires
the expected cost of these benefits 45
be recognized during the employees' years of service. As
authorized by the IURC, SIGECO deferred as a regulatory
asset the additional SFAS No. 106 costs accrued over the
costs of benefits actually paid after date of adoption, but
prior to inclusion in rates. In June 1995, the IURC
authorized SIGECO to include in electric rates SFAS No. 106
cost and to recover the amounts previously deferred over a
60-month period beginning June 1995. In July 1996, the IURC
authorized SIGECO to include in gas rates SFAS No. 106 cost
and to recover the amounts previously deferred over a 60-
month period beginning July 1996.

Unrecognized net gain               9,562   6,121
Accrued postretirement benefit liability    $10,084  $ 9,056
The assumptions used to develop the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1996 and
1995 included a discount rate of 725% and a health care
cost trend rate of 9% declining to 5% in 2004. The
estimated cost of these future benefits could be
significantly affected by future changes in health care
costs, work force demographics, interest rates or plan
changes. A 1% increase in the assumed health care cost
trend rate each year would increase the aggregate service
and interest costs for 1996 by $560,000 and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by $5,000,000. 
In 1995, SIGECO adopted Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association VEBA Trust Agreements for the funding of
postretirement health benefits for retirees and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries. Annual funding is
discretionary and is based on the projected cost over time
of benefits to be provided to covered persons consistent
with acceptable actuarial methods. To the extent these
postretirement benefits are funded, the benefits will not be
shown as a liability on SIGECO financial statements. 
CASH FLOW INFORMATION For the purposes of the Consolidated
Balance Sheets and the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, SIGCORP considers all highly liquid debt instruments
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less

During 1996, 1995 and 1994, SIGCORP paid interest net of
amounts capitalized of $20,328,000, $20,085,000 and
$18,053,000, respectively, and income taxes of $12,237,000 10,334,000 and $15,447,000, respectively. SIGCORP is
involved in several partnerships which are partially
financed by partnership obligations amounting to $6,839,000
and $9,625,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. 
During 1996, 1995 and 1994, SIGECO paid interest net of

INVENTORIES SIGECO accounts for inventories under the
average cost method except for gas in underground storage
which is accounted for under the last-in, first-out LIFO
method. Effective January 1, 1996, SIGECO Hoosier
Division changed from the average cost to the last-in,
first-out method of valuing gas in underground storage. 
This change had an immaterial effect on financial
statements. Inventories are as follows                          
Fuel coal and oil for electric generation  $ 6,539  $11,163 
Materials and supplies             15,614  15,422 
Gas in underground storage - at LIFO cost    9,088   5,822 
- at average cost     -   2,555 
Total inventories               $31,241  $34,962 
Based on the December 1996 price of gas purchased, the cost
of replacing the current portion of gas in underground
storage at December 31, 1996 exceeded the amount stated on a
LIFO basis by approximately $23,000,000.
OPERATING REVENUES AND FUEL COSTS SIGECO accrues an
estimate of revenues unbilled for electric and gas service
furnished from the meter reading dates to the end of each
accounting period.
All metered gas rates contain a gas cost adjustment clause
which allows for adjustment in charges for changes in the
cost of purchased gas. The calculation of the adjustment
factor is based on the estimated cost of gas in a future
quarter, and provides that any under- or overrecovery caused
by variances between estimated and actual cost in a given
quarter, as well as refunds from its pipeline suppliers,
will be included in adjustment factors of four future
quarters beginning with the second succeeding quarter
adjustment factor. 
All metered electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause
which allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy
to reflect changes in the cost of fuel and the net energy
cost of purchased power. The calculation of the adjustment
factor is based on the estimated cost of fuel and the net
energy cost of purchased power in a future quarter, and
provides that any under- or overrecovery caused by variances
between estimated and actual cost in a given quarter will be
included in the second succeeding quarter adjustment
factor.
SIGECO also collects through a quarterly rate adjustment
mechanism, the margin on electric sales lost due to the
implementation of demand side management programs.
SIGECO records monthly any adjustment clause under- or
overrecovery as an asset or liability, respectively, until
such time as it is billed or refunded to its customers. The
IURC reviews for approval the adjustment clause factors on a
quarterly basis.
47
The cost of gas sold is charged to operating expense as
delivered to customers and the cost of fuel for electric
generation is charged to operating expense when consumed.
Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters
SIGCORP and SIGECO
GAS MATTERS On September 7, 1995, SIGECO petitioned the
IURC seeking a general increase in gas rates. The requested
adjustment in rates, over those granted in 1993, is
necessary to recover increases in operating and maintenance
costs and additional investment in gas distribution
facilities. The adjustment included recovery of additional
costs incurred for postretirement benefits other than
pensions related to gas operations approximating $11
million annually beginning in 1993 which had been deferred
pending inclusion in rates. The petition also requested the
merger into SIGECO of its Lincoln Natural Gas Company
subsidiary LNG and the consolidation of gas rates for
customers of SIGECO Evansville and Hoosier divisions and
of LNG into one set of rates. On July 3, 1996, the IURC
issued its order, effective July 15, 1996, granting a 73 or $48 million, increase in annual revenues.
In 1992, FERC issued Order No. 636 which required interstate
pipelines to restructure their services by unbundling 
pipeline sales service so that gas supplies are sold
separately from interstate transportation services. FERC
authorized the pipelines to seek recovery of certain
transition costs associated with the restructuring from
their customers. SIGECO total transition costs will
approximate $42 million. Through 1995, SIGECO was billed
$3 million of these transition costs by its former major
pipeline supplier, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, $18
million of which it deferred pending authorization by the
IURC of recovery of such costs. During 1996, SIGECO was
billed an additional $6 million of these costs. On
November 2, 1995, the IURC approved SIGECO request for
recovery of transition costs through the gas cost adjustment
and, during 1996, SIGECO recovered all previously deferred
costs.
ELECTRIC MATTERS On June 21, 1995, the IURC approved the
third of three planned general electric rate increases
related to SIGECO Clean Air Act Compliance project
primarily the addition of a sulfur dioxide scrubber to
serve Culley Units 2 and 3, which began commercial
operation February 1995. The third adjustment also covered
certain nonscrubber-related operating costs such as
additional costs incurred for postretirement benefits other
than pensions beginning in 1993, and the recovery of demand
side management program expenditures. The effective dates
and impact on annual electric revenues of the three
adjustments are summarized below                    Additional
Effective     Annual      Revenue
Date       Revenues     Increase
Adjustment 1    October 1, 1993  $18 million   10%
Adjustment 2    June 29, 1994   42 million   23
Adjustment 3    June 26, 1995   45 million   21 Over the past several years, SIGECO has been actively
involved in intensive contract negotiations and legal
actions to reduce its coal costs and thereby lower its
electric rates. During 1992, SIGECO was successful in
negotiating a new coal supply contract with one of its major
coal suppliers effective through 1995. Included in the
agreement was a provision whereby the contract could be
reopened by SIGECO for modification of certain coal
specifications. In early 1993, SIGECO reopened the contract
for such modifications. In response, the coal supplier
elected to terminate the contract enabling SIGECO to buy out
the remainder of its contractual obligations and acquire
lower-priced spot market coal. The cost of the contract
buyout totaled approximately $186 million. The IURC
approved SIGECO request to amortize all buyout costs to
coal inventory during the period July 1, 1993 through
December 31, 1995 and to recover such costs through the fuel
adjustment clause beginning February 1994. SIGECO estimates
the total savings in coal costs during the 1991-1995 period
resulting from the renegotiation and subsequent buyout, net
of the total buyout costs, approximated $59 million. The
net savings were passed back to SIGECO electric customers
through the fuel adjustment clause.
On April 10, 1995, SIGECO reached an agreement with its
remaining long-term contract coal supplier, effective July
16, 1995, to buy out the remainder of SIGECO contractual
obligations for $455 million, enabling it to
48
acquire lower-priced spot market coal. SIGECO had been in
litigation with this coal supplier for several years. Under
the terms of the original contract, SIGECO was allegedly
obligated to take a minimum of 600,000 tons of coal
annually. In early 1993, SIGECO informed the supplier that
it would not require shipments under the contract until
later in 1993. On March 26, 1993, SIGECO and the supplier
agreed to resume coal shipments under the terms of a letter
agreement which were effective until final resolution of the
litigation. Under the letter agreement, the invoiced price
per ton was substantially lower than the contract price. As
approved by the IURC, SIGECO charged the full contract price
to coal inventory for recovery through the fuel adjustment
clause. The difference between the contract price and the
invoice price, $289 million at July 15, 1995, was deposited
in an escrow account and subsequently applied to the buyout
premium. The remaining buyout costs, about $166 million,
were amortized to coal inventory over a 14-month period
ending September 1996 and will be fully recovered through
the fuel adjustment clause by mid-1997. SIGECO estimates
the total savings in coal costs resulting from the buyout,
net of total buyout costs, will approximate $58 million
through December 31, 1998, the term of the original
contract. The net savings are being passed back to SIGECO
electric customers through the fuel adjustment clause. All
issues in litigation were dismissed as a condition of the
settlement agreement, and all other interim agreements with
this coal supplier were terminated as of July 16, 1995.
Note 3 Revenues Accounting Change
SIGCORP and SIGECO
SIGECO previously recognized electric and gas revenues when
customers were billed on a cycle billing basis. The utility
service rendered after monthly meter reading dates through
the end of a calendar month unbilled revenues became a
part of operating revenues in the following month. To more
closely match revenues with expenses, effective January 1,
1995, SIGECO changed its method of accounting to accrue the
amount of revenue for sales unbilled at the end of each
month. The cumulative effect of the change on prior years,
net of income taxes, is included in net income for 1995. 
The effect of the change was to increase 1995 net income
$79 million $50 per share, of which an increase of $16
million $10 per share, was reflected in operations and an
increase of $63 million $40 per share, the cumulative
effect of the change as of January 1, 1995, was reported as
a separate component of net income. 
Summarized below is the pro forma effect of the accounting
change, as if the change had been effective during the
periods

Note 4 Leveraged Leases
SIGCORP
Southern Indiana Properties, Inc. is a lessor in five
leveraged lease agreements under which an office building, a
part of a reservoir, an interest in a paper mill, a gas
turbine electric generating peaking unit and passenger
railroad cars are leased to third parties. The economic
lives and lease terms vary with the leases. The total
equipment and facilities cost was approximately $110,800,000
and $101,200,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The cost of the equipment and facilities was
partially financed by nonrecourse debt provided by lenders,
who have been granted an assignment of rentals due under the
leases and a security interest in the leased property, which
they accepted as their sole remedy in the event of default
by the lessee. Such debt amounted to approximately 
$81,700,000 and $80,970,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. SIGCORP net investment in leveraged leases
at those dates was $12,185,000 and $5,862,000, respectively,

SIGCORP and SIGECO
The annual sinking fund requirement of SIGECO first
mortgage bonds is 1% of the greatest amount of bonds
outstanding under the Mortgage Indenture. This requirement
may be satisfied by certification to the Trustee of unfunded
property additions in the prescribed amount as provided in
the Mortgage Indenture. SIGECO intends to meet the 1997
sinking fund requirement by this means and, accordingly, the
sinking fund requirement for 1997 is excluded from current
liabilities on the balance sheet. At December 31, 1996 215,725,000 of SIGECO utility plant remained unfunded
under SIGECO Mortgage Indenture.
Several of SIGCORP partnership investments have been
financed through obligations with such partnerships. 
Additionally, SIGCORP investments in leveraged leases have
been partially financed through notes payable to banks. Of
the amount of first mortgage bonds, notes payable and
partnership obligations outstanding at December 31, 1996,
the following amounts mature in the five years subsequent to

control series first mortgage bonds could, at the election
of the bondholder, be tendered to SIGECO in May 1997. If
SIGECO agent is unable to remarket any bonds tendered at
that time, SIGECO would be required to obtain additional
funds for payment to bondholders. For financial statement
presentation purposes those bonds subject to tender in 1997
are shown as current liabilities.

SIGCORP and SIGECO
COMMON STOCK Each outstanding share of SIGCORP common
stock contains a right which entitles registered holders to
purchase from SIGCORP one one-hundredth of a share of
SIGCORP common stock, at an initial price of $65 per share
Purchase Price subject to adjustment. The rights will not
be exercisable until a party acquires beneficial ownership
of 10% of common shares or makes a tender offer for at least
10% of its common shares. The rights expire December 31,
2005. If not exercisable, the rights in whole may be
redeemed by SIGCORP at a price of $01 per right at any time
prior to their expiration. If at any time after the rights
become exercisable and are not redeemed and SIGCORP is
involved in a merger or other business combination
transaction, proper provision shall be made to entitle a
holder of a right to buy common stock of the acquiring
company having a value of two times such Purchase Price.
SIGECO has a common stock option plan for its key management
employees. The option price for all stock options is at
least 100% of the fair market value of SIGCORP common stock
at the grant date. Options generally vest and become
exercisable between one and three years in equal annual
installments beginning one year after the grant date, and
generally expire in 10 years. The expiration dates for
options outstanding as of 
52
December 31, 1996, ranged from July 13, 2004 to July 14,
2006. Stock option activity for the past two years was as
follows At December 31                   1996     1995

Reserved for future grants at end of year     281,410   310,106 
Average Option Price - Exercised          $2763    $2763 
- Outstanding at end of year $3104    $2820 SIGCORP adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, in 1996 by continuing to account for stock
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 
If SIGCORP had recognized compensation expense for its
stock-based compensation plan according to the new standard,
the effect on net income and earnings per share for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 would
have been insignificant.
CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The amount payable in
the event of involuntary liquidation of each series of the
$100 par value preferred stock is $100 per share, plus
accrued dividends. This nonredeemable preferred stock is
callable at the option of SIGECO as follows: the 48% Series
at $110 per share, plus accrued dividends; and the 475%
Series at $101 per share, plus accrued dividends.
CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The Series
has an interest rate of 650% and is redeemable at $100 per
share on December 1, 2002. In the event of involuntary
liquidation of this series of $100 par value preferred
stock, the amount payable is $100 per share, plus accrued
dividends.
CUMULATIVE SPECIAL PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The Cumulative
Special Preferred Stock contains a provision which allows
the stock to be tendered on any of its dividend payment
dates. On March 8, 1995, SIGECO repurchased 913 shares of
the Cumulative Special Preferred Stock at a cost of $91,300
as a result of a tender within the provision of the
issuance.

Redeemable Preferred Stock   7,500   7,367    7,500    7,260 At December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, the fair value of SIGCORP
debt relating to utility operations exceeded carrying amounts by
$41,000,000 and $36,000,000. Anticipated regulatory treatment of the
excess or deficiency of fair value over carrying amounts of SIGECO long-
term debt, if in fact settled at amounts approximating those above, would
dictate that these amounts be used to reduce or increase SIGECO rates
over a prescribed amortization period. Accordingly, any settlement would
not result in a material impact on SIGECO financial position or results
of operations.
LONG-TERM DEBT The fair value of SIGECO long-term debt was estimated
based on the current quoted market rate of utilities with a comparable debt
rating. Nonutility long-term debt was valued based upon the most recent
debt financing.
REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The fair value of SIGECO redeemable
preferred stock was estimated based on the current quoted market rate of
utilities with a comparable debt rating.
PARTNERSHIP OBLIGATIONS The fair value of SIGCORP partnership
obligations was estimated based on the current quoted market rate of
comparable debt. 56 Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited
