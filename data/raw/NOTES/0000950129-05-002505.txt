37 Table of Contents REPORT OF MANAGEMENT Managements Report on Financial Information and
Procedures The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc.
and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, applying
certain estimates and judgments as required. Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or
detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further,
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the
company have been detected. These inherent limitations include
the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty
and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or
mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of
controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in
the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based upon the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2004. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal
control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on the
following page. 38 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Quanta Services, Inc. We have completed an integrated audit of Quanta Services,
Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below. Consolidated financial statements In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index, present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2002, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill as a result of adopting the provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and other Intangible Assets. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, which appears on the preceding page, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by COSO. The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on managements
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial 39 Table of Contents statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Houston, Texas March15, 2005 40 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS In thousands, except share information

2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the
accounts of Quanta and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.   
Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years
financial statements to conform to classifications used in the
current year.   
Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist
as of the date the financial statements are published and the
reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the
periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates
affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring
basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior
to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on
Quantas beliefs and assumptions derived from information
available at the time such judgments and estimates are made.
Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are
inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates
are primarily used in Quantas assessment of the allowance
for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of
property and equipment, fair value assumptions in analyzing
goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, self-insured claims
liabilities, revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion
accounting and provision for income taxes.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Quanta considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   
Supplemental Cash Flow Information Quanta had non-cash investing and financing activities, pursuant
to its acquisition program. In 2002, Quanta acquired assets
through purchase acquisitions with an estimated fair value, net
of cash acquired, of $20million and liabilities of
$25million, resulting in the recording of
$118million in goodwill. The 45 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
aggregate consideration paid in these transactions consisted of
$80million in cash, net of cash acquired, and
251,079shares of common stock. The pro forma effects of
these transactions were not material. During 2003 and 2004,
Quanta did not complete any acquisitions.   
Current and Long-Term Accounts and NotesReceivable
and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when
collection of an account or note receivable is considered
doubtful. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for
doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including,
among others, the customers access to capital, the
customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic
conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Under
certain circumstances such as foreclosures or negotiated
settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in
lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. As of
December31, 2004, Quanta had allowances for doubtful
accounts of approximately $526million. Certain of
Quantas customers, several of them large public
telecommunications carriers and utility customers, have been
experiencing financial difficulties. Should any major customers
file for bankruptcy or continue to experience difficulties, or
should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in
existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to
materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and
losses in excess of current allowances provided. In addition,
material changes in Quantas customers revenues or
cash flows could affect its ability to collect amounts due from
them. In June 2002, one of Quantas customers, Adelphia
Communications Corporation Adelphia, filed for bankruptcy
protection under Chapter11 of the Bankruptcy Code, as
amended. During the third quarter of 2004, Quanta sold its
prepetition receivable due from Adelphia to a third party for
approximately $295million which approximated its net
carrying value. Quanta received $235million in proceeds
during the third quarter with the remaining $60million of
proceeds being held by the buyer pending the resolution of
certain preferential payment claims. The account receivable
associated with the $60million holdback is recorded in
Accounts and NotesReceivable as of December31, 2004
as it is uncertain whether the balance will be collected within
one year. Also included in Accounts and NotesReceivable are amounts
due from a customer relating to the construction of independent
power plants. Quanta has agreed to long-term payment terms for
this customer. The notes receivable from this customer are
partially secured. Quanta has provided allowances for a
significant portion of these notes receivable due to a change in
the economic viability of the plants securing them. The
collectibility of these notes may ultimately depend on the value
of the collateral securing these notes. In addition, Quanta is
involved in negotiations with one of its customers and is
uncertain whether the balance will be collected within one year;
therefore, as of December31, 2004, Quanta has included the
balance in Accounts and NotesReceivable. As of
December31, 2004, the total balance due from these two
customers was $548million, net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts of $428million. The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to
retainage provisions in certain contracts will be due upon
completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer.
Based on Quantas experience with similar contracts in
recent years, the majority of the retention balance at each
balance sheet date will be collected within the subsequent
fiscal year. Current retainage balances as of December31,
2003 and 2004 were approximately $372million and
$309million, and are included in Accounts Receivable. Due to contractual provisions, certain balances, though the
earnings process is complete, are not billable to customers
until defined milestones are reached. These balances are
considered to be unbilled receivables and are included in
Accounts Receivable at year-end. At December31, 2003 and
2004, these balances were approximately $438million and
$418million. 46 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Concentration of Credit Risk Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally
without collateral, to its customers, which include electric
power and gas companies, telecommunications and cable television
system operators, governmental entities, general contractors,
builders and owners and managers of commercial and industrial
properties located primarily in the United States. Consequently,
Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in
business and economic factors throughout the United States;
however, Quanta generally has certain lien rights with respect
to services provided. No customer accounted for more than 10% of
accounts receivable or revenues as of or for the years ended
December31, 2003 or 2004.   
Inventories Inventories consist of parts and supplies held for use in the
ordinary course of business and are valued by Quanta at the
lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out
FIFOmethod.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated
salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
the asset. Depreciation and amortization expense related to
property and equipment was approximately $602million 595million and $597million for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense
when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments,
which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are
capitalized and depreciated. Upon retirement or disposition of
property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting
gain or loss is recognized in the statements of operations. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
asset are compared to the assets carrying amount to
determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. The
effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference
between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value. Net
gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment are
reflected in Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   
Debt Issuance Costs As of December31, 2003 and 2004, capitalized debt issuance
costs related to Quantas credit facility and the
convertible subordinated notes were included in Other Assets,
net and are being amortized into interest expense over the terms
of the respective agreements. As of December31, 2003 and
2004, capitalized debt issuance costs were $178million
and $191million with accumulated amortization of
$32million and $67million. For the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, amortization expense was
$36million, $35million and $35million,
respectively. Quanta incurred $77million in debt issuance costs related
to the October 2003 45%convertible subordinated notes
offering, which were capitalized and are being amortized over
five years to October1, 2008, the first date of the
holders put option discussed in Note5. Quanta
capitalized debt issuance costs of $44million in
connection with the credit facility entered into in December
2003. Upon retirement of certain debt and the termination of
Quantas former credit facility in the fourth quarter of
2003, Quanta expensed $33million of unamortized debt
issuance costs as part of the loss on early extinguishment of
debt. 47 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Goodwill and Other Intangibles Effective January1, 2002, Quanta adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which
establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for
goodwill and other intangible assets. Under
SFASNo142, all goodwill amortization ceased
effective January1, 2002. Material amounts of recorded goodwill attributable to each of
Quantas reporting units are tested for impairment by
comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its
carrying value. Fair value is determined using a combination of
the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market
capitalization valuation approaches. These impairment tests were
required to be performed at adoption of SFASNo142
and at least annually thereafter. Significant estimates used in
the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows, future
short-term and long-term growth rates, weighted average cost of
capital and estimates of market multiples for each of the
reportable units. On an ongoing basis, absent any impairment
indicators, Quanta performs impairment tests annually during the
fourth quarter. SFAS No. 142 does not allow increases in the
carrying value of reporting units that may result from
Quantas impairment test, therefore Quanta may record
goodwill impairments in the future, even when the aggregate fair
value of Quantas reporting units and Quanta as a whole may
increase. Based on Quantas transitional impairment test performed
upon adoption of SFASNo142 on January1, 2002,
it recognized a $4885million non-cash charge 4454million, net of tax to reduce the carrying value
of goodwill to the implied fair value of Quantas reporting
units. This impairment is a result of adopting a fair value
approach, under SFASNo142, to testing impairment of
goodwill as compared to the previous method utilized, as
permitted under accounting standards existing at that time, in
which evaluations of goodwill impairment were made by Quanta
using estimated future undiscounted cash flows to determine if
goodwill would be recoverable. Under SFASNo142, the
impairment adjustment recognized at adoption of the new rules
was reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, net of tax, in the year ended December31, 2002. Quanta further recognized an interim non-cash goodwill
impairment charge of $1666million during the year ended
December31, 2002. Impairment adjustments recognized after
adoption are required to be recognized as operating expenses.
The primary factor contributing to the interim impairment charge
was the overall deterioration of the business climate during
2002 in the markets Quanta serves as evidenced at the time by an
increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunications
industry, continued devaluation of several of Quantas
customers debt and equity securities and pricing pressures
resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants.
During 2003, as part of our annual goodwill test for impairment,
goodwill of $65million was written off as a non-cash
operating expense associated with the closure of one of our
telecom subsidiaries. A summary of changes in Quantas goodwill is as follows in
thousands

Quanta has recorded an Other Intangible Asset of
$21million related to customer relationships during 2002.
The estimated life of this intangible asset is eight years and
accumulated amortization as of 48 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
December31, 2003 and 2004, was approximately
$05million and $08million. Estimated annual
amortization expense for future periods is approximately
$03million.   
Revenue Recognition Quanta recognizes revenue when services are performed except
when work is being performed under a fixed price contract.
Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized on the
percentage-of-completion method measured by the percentage of
costs incurred-to-date to total estimated costs for each
contract. Such contracts generally provide that the customer
accept completion of progress to date and compensate Quanta for
services rendered, measured typically in terms of units
installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress.
Contract costs typically include all direct material, labor and
subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract
performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs
and depreciation costs. Provisions for the total estimated
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which
such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job
conditions, estimated profitability and final contract
settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and
their effects are recognized in the period in which the
revisions are determined. The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess
of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenues
recognized in excess of amounts billed. The current liability
Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on
uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of
revenues recognized.   
Income Taxes Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income
taxes in accordance with SFASNo109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered
or settled. Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for
deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain
and Quanta maintains an allowance for tax contingencies, which
Quanta believes is adequate. The estimation of required
valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable
income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during
the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual
future taxable income differs from estimates, Quanta may not
realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated.   
Collective Bargaining Agreements Certain of the subsidiaries are party to various collective
bargaining agreements with certain of their employees. The
agreements require such subsidiaries to pay specified wages and
provide certain benefits to their union employees. These
agreements expire at various times.   
Self-Insurance As of December31, 2004, Quanta is insured for
employers liability and general liability claims, subject
to a deductible of $1,000,000per occurrence and for auto
liability and workers compensation claims, subject to a
deductible of $2,000,000per occurrence. In addition,
Quanta maintains a non-union employee related health care
benefits plan that is subject to a deductible of
$250,000per claimant per year. Losses up to the deductible
amounts are accrued based upon Quantas estimates of the
ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims
incurred but not reported. The accruals are based upon known
facts and historical trends and management believes such
accruals to be adequate. As of December31, 2003, the
amounts accrued for 49 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
self-insurance claims totaled $623million, with
$362million considered to be long-term and included in
Other Non-Current Liabilities. As of December31, 2004, the
gross amounts accrued for self-insurance claims totaled
$926million, with $563million considered to be
long-term and included in Other Non-Current Liabilities, and
related insurance recoveries/receivables were $70million,
of which $41million is included in Prepaid Expenses and
Other Current Assets and $29million is included in Other
Assets, net. Quantas casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods
from August1, 2000 to February28, 2003 is
experiencing financial distress but is currently paying valid
claims. In the event that this insurers financial
situation deteriorates, Quanta may be required to pay certain
obligations that otherwise would have been paid by this insurer.
Quanta estimates that the total future claim amount that this
insurer is currently obligated to pay on Quantas behalf
for the above-mentioned policy periods is approximately
$40million, and Quanta has recorded a receivable and
corresponding liability of such amount as of December31,
2004 included in the insurance recoveries/receivables and
liabilities discussed above. However, Quantas estimate of
the potential range of these future claim amounts is between
$20million and $90million. The actual amounts
ultimately paid by Quanta related to these claims, if any, may
vary materially from the above range and could be impacted by
further claims development and the extent to which the insurer
could not honor its obligations. Quanta continues to monitor the
financial situation of this insurer and analyze any alternative
actions that could be pursued. In any event, Quanta does not
expect any failure by this insurer to honor its obligations to
Quanta, or any alternative actions Quanta may pursue, to have a
material adverse impact on Quantas financial condition;
however, the impact could be material to Quantas results
of operations or cash flows in a given period. As of December31, 2003, Quanta had restricted cash
pursuant to an obligation with Quantas casualty insurance
policy for the period from March1, 2003 to
February29, 2004. As of December31, 2003, the
balance of the restricted cash was $93million of which
$87million was classified in Prepaid Expenses and Other
Current Assets and $06million was classified in Other
Assets, net. The total balance of restricted cash was used to
pay claims in 2004 and there was no restricted cash as of
December31, 2004.   
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, the credit facility and notes
payable to various financial institutions approximate fair
value. The fair value of the convertible subordinated notes is
estimated based on quoted secondary market prices for these
notes as of year-end. At December31, 2003 and 2004, the
fair value of Quantas 40%convertible subordinated
notes of $1725million was approximately
$1572million and $1647million. At
December31, 2003 and 2004, the fair value of Quantas
45%convertible subordinated notes of $2700million
was approximately $2849million and $2973million.   
Stock Based Compensation Through December31, 2004, Quanta accounted for its
stock-based compensation under APB Opinion No25
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this
accounting method, no compensation expense is recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations if no intrinsic value of
the option exists at the date of grant. In December 2004, the
FASB issued SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFASNo123R, requiring companies to
account for stock based compensation awards based on the fair
value of the awards at the date they are granted. The resulting
compensation cost would be shown as an expense in the
consolidated statements of operations. SFASNo123R
is effective beginning in the third quarter of 2005. Until
effective, disclosure is required as to what net income and
earnings per share would have been had the fair value method
been followed for our stock option awards outstanding under the
2001 Stock Incentive Plan and stock issued pursuant to our
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. The expense recognition for
the restricted stock awards are the same under APB Opinion
No25 and SFASNo123R with expense being
recognized in the financial statements. 50 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The fair market value of each option grant is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions for 2002: irisk-free interest
rates ranging from 345% to 527%, iiexpected life of
67years, iiiaverage volatility of 1445%
ivdividend yield of 0%. There were no option grants
during 2003 and 2004. For the ESPP, compensation cost approximates the difference
between the fair value of Quantas common stock and the
actual common stock purchase price on the date of grant. Had compensation costs for the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and the
ESPP been determined consistent with SFASNo123,
Quantas net income attributable to common stock and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the following as
adjusted amounts, which also approximate the effect of SFAS No.

New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
EITFdiscussed EITF Issue04-08, Accounting
Issues Related to Certain Features of Contingently Convertible
Debt and the Effect on Diluted Earnings per Share. The
EITF reached a consensus that would require all issued
securities with contingent conversion features containing market
price contingencies based on a companys stock price to be
accounted for using the if converted method in
calculating earnings per share. This EITF would require that
earnings per share be retroactively restated for the effect of
conversion of any contingently convertible debt instruments
starting with the issuance date of the contingently convertible
debt instrument. The consensus is effective for Quanta on
December31, 2004. Our 45%convertible subordinated
notes contain contingent conversion features; however the
adoption of EITF04-08 does not impact of our earnings per
share as reported as the effect of assuming conversion of the
45%convertible subordinated notes would be antidilutive
for all periods since the date of issuance. However, the effect
of this EITF increases the likelihood that these notes could
have a dilutive effect in the future. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASBissued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFASNo123R. SFASNo123R
requires companies to recognize an expense for the value of
employee stock-based compensation. Cost of Quantas stock
option awards under our 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and stock
issued pursuant to our ESPP will be measured at fair value on
the awards grant date, based on the estimated number 51 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
of awards that are expected to vest. Companies are to select
from three transition methods. Quanta is currently evaluating
the three transition methods for adopting
SFASNo123R. SFASNo123R is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after June15,
2005. Quantas existing pro forma disclosure included above
presents the approximate impact of SFASNo123R had
it been adopted in the periods presented. Quanta continues to
assess the impact of adopting SFASNo123R, including
the need for changes in our compensation strategies.
StatementNo123R also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating
cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing
cash flows in periods after adoption. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No153, Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion
No29, which modifies the existing guidance on
accounting for nonmonetary transactions in Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions, to eliminate an exception under which
certain exchanges of similar productive nonmonetary assets were
not accounted for at fair value. SFAS No153 instead
provides a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets
that do not have commercial substance. This statement must be
applied to nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June15, 2005. Quanta does not
anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No153 will have a
material impact on Quantas results of operations or
financial position.   
3.
PER SHARE INFORMATION Earnings loss per share amounts are based on the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and common stock
equivalents outstanding during the period. For the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, stock
options for approximately 79million, 09million and
07million shares, respectively, were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the
options exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of Quantas common stock. For the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, approximately 116,000,
16,000 and 41,000, respectively, stock options with exercise
prices lower than the average market price of Quantas
common stock were also excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the effect of including them would be
antidilutive. For the years ended December31, 2002, 2003
and 2004, the effect of assuming conversion of the convertible
subordinated notes would be antidilutive and they were therefore
excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For
the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, none,
09million and 07millionshares, respectively,
of non-vested restricted stock were excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share as the impact would
have been antidilutive.

Credit Facility As of December31, 2004, Quanta had a $1850million
credit facility with various lenders. The credit facility
consisted of a $1500million letter of credit facility
maturing on June19, 2008, which also provides for term
loans, and a $350million revolving credit facility
maturing on December19, 2007, which provides for revolving
loans and letters of credit. On January4, 2005, the
maximum availability under the letter of credit facility was
automatically reduced by $15million, resulting in current
maximum availability of $1835million, and will be
automatically reduced by $15million on December31
of each year thereafter. As of December31, 2004, the letter of credit facility was
linked to a $1500million deposit made by the lenders,
which is held in an account with Bank of America, N.A. This
deposit may be used either to support letters of credit or, to
the extent that amounts available under the facility are not
used to support letters of credit, for term loans. As of
December31, 2004, Quanta was required to maintain total
borrowings outstanding under the letter of credit facility equal
to the $1500million available through a combination of
letters of credit or term loans. We had approximately
$1289million of letters of credit issued under the letter
of credit facility and $208million of the letter of
credit facility outstanding as a term loan. The remaining
$03million was available for issuing new letters of
credit. In the event that Quanta desires to issue additional
letters of credit under the letter of credit facility, Quanta is
required to make cash repayments of debt outstanding under the
term loan portion of the letter of credit facility in an amount
that approximates the additional letters of credit to be issued.
The weighted average interest rate for the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2004 associated with amounts
outstanding under the term loan was 415% and 444%. Under the letter of credit facility, Quanta is subject to a fee
equal to 300% to 325% of the letters of credit outstanding,
depending upon the occurrence of certain events, plus an
additional 015% of the amount outstanding to the extent the
funds in the deposit account do not earn interest equal to the
London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR. Term loans under the
letter of credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to
either athe Eurodollar Rate as defined in the credit
facility plus 300% to 325% or bthe Base Rate as
described below plus 300% to 325%, depending upon the
occurrence of certain events. The Base Rate equals the higher of
ithe Federal Funds Rate as defined in the credit
facility plus 1/2 of 1% and iithe banks prime
rate. Quanta had approximately $39million of letters of credit
issued under the revolving credit facility, and borrowing
availability under the revolving credit facility was
$311million as of December31, 2004. Amounts
borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a
rate equal to either athe Eurodollar Rate plus 54 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
175% to 300%, as determined by the ratio of Quantas
total funded debt to EBITDA, or bthe Base Rate plus
025% to 150%, as determined by the ratio of Quantas
total funded debt to EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the
revolving credit facility are subject to a letter of credit fee
of 175% to 300%, based on the ratio of Quantas total
funded debt to EBITDA. If Quanta chooses to cash collateralize
letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility,
those letters of credit will be subject to a letter of credit
fee of 050%. Quanta is also subject to a commitment fee of
0375% to 0625%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to
EBITDA, on any unused availability under the revolving credit
facility. The credit facility contains certain covenants, including a
maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio, a maximum senior debt to
EBITDA ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum asset
coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth covenant. As
of December31, 2004, Quanta was in compliance with all of
its covenants. However, other conditions such as, but not
limited to, unforeseen project delays or cancellations, adverse
weather conditions or poor contract performance, could adversely
affect Quantas ability to comply with its covenants in the
future. The credit facility also limits acquisitions, capital
expenditures and asset sales and, subject to some exceptions,
prohibits liens on material assets, stock repurchase programs
and the payment of dividends other than dividend payments or
other distributions payable solely in capital stock. Currently,
however, the credit facility allows Quanta to pay dividends and
engage in stock repurchase programs in the amount of
$250million in 2005 and in any fiscal year thereafter in
an aggregate amount up to twenty-five percent of Quantas
consolidated net income plus the amount of non-cash charges
that reduced such consolidated net income for the prior fiscal
year. The credit facility carries cross-default provisions with
all of Quantas other debt instruments exceeding
$20million in borrowings. The credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of the capital
stock of Quantas U.S.subsidiaries, 65% of the
capital stock of Quantas foreign subsidiaries and
substantially all of Quantas assets. Borrowings under the
credit facility are to be used for working capital, capital
expenditures and for other general corporate purposes.
Quantas U.S.subsidiaries guarantee the repayment of
all amounts due under the credit facility. Quantas
obligations under the credit facility constitute designated
senior indebtedness under its 40% and 45%convertible
subordinated notes.   
40%Convertible Subordinated Notes As of December31, 2004, Quanta had $1725million of
40%convertible subordinated notes outstanding. These
40%convertible subordinated notes are registered and
convertible into shares of Quantas common stock at a price
of $5453per share, subject to adjustment as a result of
certain events. These 40%convertible subordinated notes
require semi-annual interest payments on July1 and
December31 until the notes mature on July1, 2007.
Quanta has the option to redeem the 40%convertible
subordinated notes beginning July3, 2003 at specified
redemption prices, together with accrued and unpaid interest;
however early redemption is prohibited by Quantas credit
facility. If certain fundamental changes occur, as described in
the indenture, holders of the 40%convertible subordinated
notes may require Quanta to purchase all or part of the notes at
a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest.   
45%Convertible Subordinated Notes As of December31, 2004, Quanta had $2700million of
45%convertible subordinated notes outstanding. These
45%convertible subordinated notes are registered and
convertible into shares of Quantas common stock at a price
of $1114per share, subject to adjustment as a result of
certain events. The 45%convertible subordinated notes
require semi-annual interest payments on April1 and
October1, until they mature on October1, 2023. The 45%convertible subordinated notes are convertible by
the holder if iduring any fiscal quarter the last
reported sale price of Quantas common stock is greater
than or equal to 120% of the conversion price for at least 20
trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending
on the first trading day of such 55 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
fiscal quarter, iiduring the five business day period
after any five consecutive trading day period in which the
trading price per note for each day of that period was less than
98% of the product of the last reported sale price of
Quantas common stock and the conversion rate,
iiiupon Quanta calling the notes for redemption or
ivupon the occurrence of specified corporate
transactions. If the notes become convertible under one of these
circumstances, Quanta has the option to deliver cash, shares of
Quantas common stock or a combination thereof, with a
value equal to the par value of the notes divided by the
conversion price multiplied by the average trading price of
Quantas common stock. The maximum number of shares of
common stock that could be issued under these circumstances is
equal to the par value of the notes divided by the conversion
price. During the year ended December31, 2004, none of the
circumstances permitting conversion had occurred. Beginning October8, 2008, Quanta may redeem for cash some
or all of the 45%convertible subordinated notes at par
value plus accrued and unpaid interest; however early redemption
is prohibited by Quantas credit facility. The holders of
the 45%convertible subordinated notes may require Quanta
to repurchase all or some of the notes at par value plus accrued
and unpaid interest on October1, 2008, 2013 or 2018, or
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined by the
indenture under which Quanta issued the notes. Quanta must pay
any required repurchases on October1, 2008 in cash. For
all other required repurchases, Quanta has the option to deliver
cash, shares of its common stock or a combination thereof to
satisfy its repurchase obligation. Quanta presently does not
anticipate using stock to satisfy any future obligations. If
Quanta were to satisfy the obligation with shares of its common
stock, the number of shares delivered will equal the dollar
amount to be paid in common stock divided by 985% of the market
price of Quantas common stock, as defined by the
indenture. The number of shares to be issued under this
circumstance is not limited. The right to settle for shares of
common stock can be surrendered by Quanta. The
45%convertible subordinated notes carry cross-default
provisions with Quantas credit facility and any other debt
instrument that exceeds $100million in borrowings.   
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt During the year ended December31, 2003, Quanta recognized
a $351million loss on early extinguishment of debt
relating to the termination of a former credit facility and the
retirement of certain other debt. Included in this amount is a
make-whole prepayment premium for $313million, write-off
of unamortized debt issuance costs of $33million together
with other related costs of $05million.

The current deferred income tax assets, net of current deferred
income tax liabilities, are included in Prepaid Expenses and
Other Current Assets. At December31, 2004, Quanta had federal net operating loss
carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately
$269million. These carryforwards, which may provide
future tax benefits, begin to expire in 2020. Quanta also had
state net operating loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which
is approximately $143million. These carryforwards will
expire as follows: 2006, $01million; 2007 06million; 2008, $11million; 2009 08million and $117million thereafter. In assessing the value of deferred tax assets at
December31, 2004, Quanta considered whether it was more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
would not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which 58 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers
the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected
future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon these considerations, Quanta provided a
valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of certain of
its deferred tax assets to their net expected realizable value
at December31, 2004. In 2002, a portion of the valuation
allowance was recorded through the cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle, as it related to deferred tax assets
recorded as part of the adoption of SFASNo142. Quanta has received refund claims in the amounts of
$381million in 2003 and $302million in 2004 from
the Internal Revenue Service IRS due to the carry back of
taxable losses reported on Quantas 2002 and 2003 income
tax returns. The IRS is required by law to review Quantas
claims and has notified Quanta of its intent to conduct an
examination of Quantas 2002 tax return. This examination
began in 2004 and remains ongoing. Quantas 2003 income tax
return will be subject to a comparable review. Quanta fully
cooperates with all audits, but defends existing positions
vigorously. To provide for potential tax exposures, Quanta
maintains an allowance for tax contingencies, which management
believes is adequate. The results of future audit assessments,
if any, could have a material effect on Quantas cash flows
as these audits are completed. However, management does not
believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse
effect on Quantas consolidated results of operations. During 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed
into law. The primary effect of this legislation will be to
permit potentially favorable federal income tax treatment
related to certain of Quantas construction-related
activities. However, Quanta does not currently expect any
benefit from the new law for 2005.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY   
SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock In September 1999, Quanta issued shares of SeriesA
Convertible Preferred Stock, $00001par value per share.
During 2002, 245,000shares of SeriesA Convertible
Preferred Stock were converted into shares of common stock.
During the first quarter of 2003, all remaining outstanding
shares of SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock were
converted into shares of common stock and the series was
eliminated during the second quarter of 2003. Any dividends that
had accrued on the respective shares of SeriesA Preferred
Stock were forfeited and reversed on the date of conversion,
which resulted in a $21million forfeiture for the year
ended December31, 2003.   
SeriesE Preferred Stock and Redeemable Common
Stock During the fourth quarter of 2002, First Reserve FundIX,
L.P. First Reserve purchased from Quanta approximately
24million shares of newly issued SeriesE Preferred
Stock at $3000per share. The SeriesE Preferred
Stock was converted into 243million shares of common
stock on December31, 2002 and the series was eliminated
during the second quarter of 2003. The original as-converted share price for the SeriesE
Preferred Stock on October15, 2002 was $300 per share
which was an above market price. On December20, 2002, the
date the SeriesE Preferred Stock was purchased,
Quantas stock closed at $335per share. Accordingly,
Quanta recorded a non-cash beneficial conversion charge of
$85million based on the $035per share
differential. The non-cash beneficial conversion charge is
recognized as a deemed dividend to the SeriesE Preferred
Stockholder and is recorded as a decrease to net income
attributable to common stock and an increase in additional
paid-in capital. The non-cash beneficial conversion charge had
no effect on Quantas operating income, cash flows or
stockholders equity at December31, 2002. Through February20, 2003, First Reserve had the right to
require Quanta to repurchase for cash the shares of common stock
issued as a result of the conversion of the shares of
SeriesE Preferred Stock if Quanta 59 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
had a change in control. On February20, 2003, at the
expiration of this right, the Redeemable Common Stock was
reclassified to stockholders equity. In connection with their investment, First Reserve is entitled
to a pre-emptive right to purchase shares of common stock upon
Quantas issuance of shares to third parties. During 2003,
First Reserve acquired 1,201,128shares pursuant to such
right.   
Stockholder Rights Plan Quanta has adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which
one right will be issued and attached to each outstanding share
of common stock. The following description of Quantas
stockholder rights plan and the certificate of designations
setting forth the terms and conditions of the SeriesD
Junior Preferred Stock are intended as summaries only and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the form of
stockholder rights plan and certificate of designations to the
certificate of incorporation filed with the SEC. Until a distribution date occurs, the rights can be transferred
only with the common stock. On the occurrence of a distribution
date, the rights will separate from the common stock and become
exercisable as described below. A distribution date will occur upon the earlier of   
the tenth day after a public announcement that a person or group
of affiliated or associated persons other than Quanta and
certain exempt persons an acquiring person has
acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the total voting
rights of the then outstanding shares of Quantas common
stock or, in the case of First Reserve, 37% or more of the
total voting rights;or     
the tenth business day following the commencement of a tender or
exchange offer that would result in such person or group
becoming an acquiring person. Following the distribution date, holders of rights will be
entitled to purchase from Quanta one one-thousandth 1/1000th
of a share of SeriesD Junior Preferred Stock at a purchase
price of $15333, subject to adjustment. In the event that any person or group becomes an acquiring
person, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a
right, other than rights beneficially owned by the acquiring
person, will thereafter have the right to receive upon payment
of the purchase price, that number of shares of common stock
having a market value equal to the result obtained by
Amultiplying the then current purchase price by the
number of one one-thousandths of a share of SeriesD Junior
Preferred Stock for which the right is then exercisable, and
dividing that product by B50% of the current per share
market price of our shares of common stock on the date of such
occurrence. If, following the date of a public announcement that
an acquiring person has become such, 1Quanta is acquired
in a merger or other business combination transaction and Quanta
is not the surviving corporation, 2any person
consolidates or merges with Quanta and all or part of the common
stock is converted or exchanged for securities, cash or property
of any other person, or 350% or more of Quantas
assets or earning power is sold or transferred, then the rights
will flip-over. At that time, each right will
entitle its holder to purchase, for the purchase price, a number
of shares of common stock of the surviving entity in any such
merger, consolidation or other business combination or the
purchaser in any such sale or transfer with a market value equal
to the result obtained by Xmultiplying the then current
purchase price by the number of one one-thousandths of a share
of SeriesD Junior Preferred Stock for which the right is
then exercisable, and dividing that product by Y50% of
the current per share market price of the shares of common stock
of the surviving entity on the date of consummation of such
consolidation, merger, sale or transfer. 60 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The rights will expire on March8, 2010, unless Quanta
terminates them before that time. A holder of a right will not
have any rights as a stockholder of Quanta, including the right
to vote or to receive dividends, until a right is exercised.   
Limited VoteCommon Stock The shares of Limited VoteCommon Stock have rights similar
to shares of common stock, except that such shares are entitled
to elect one member of the board of directors and are entitled
to one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other
matters. Each share of Limited VoteCommon Stock will
convert into common stock upon disposition by the holder of such
shares in accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable
to such shares. In 2002, 32,488shares, in 2003,
16,000shares and in 2004, 55,970shares of Limited
VoteCommon Stock, respectively, were converted to common
stock.   
Treasury Stock On October16, 2000 the board of directors of Quanta
authorized a Stock Repurchase Plan under which up to
$750million of Quantas common stock could be
repurchased. Under the Stock Repurchase Plan, Quanta could
conduct purchases through open market transactions in accordance
with applicable securities laws. On March13, 2002,
986,000shares of common stock previously purchased were
sold to Quantas Stock Employee Compensation Trust SECT,
a trust formed in 2002 to fund certain of Quantas future
employee benefit obligations using Quantas common stock,
and were no longer considered treasury stock. These shares were
subsequently retired on June28, 2002, after Quanta
terminated the SECT. During 2002, Quanta purchased
924,500shares of its common stock for approximately
$117million under the Stock Repurchase Plan. As of
July1, 2002, the independent committee of Quantas
board of directors determined to cease the Stock Repurchase Plan. Quanta acquired into treasury 69shares in 2003 and
342,261shares in 2004 of previously granted restricted
stock for settlement of employee tax liabilities pursuant to the
2001 Stock Incentive Plan discussed in Note8.   
Deferred Compensation Under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan discussed in Note8,
shares of Quantas common stock are issued at the fair
market value of the common stock at the date of issuance. As
restricted stock, the shares are subject to forfeiture and other
restrictions until they vest, generally over three years in
equal annual installments. However, during the restriction
period, the plan participants are entitled to vote and receive
dividends on such shares. Upon issuance of shares of restricted
stock under the plan, an unamortized compensation expense
equivalent to the market value of the shares on the date of
grant is charged to stockholders equity and is amortized
over the restriction period as non-cash compensation expense. If
shares of restricted stock are cancelled during a given period,
any remaining unamortized deferred compensation expense related
to the issuance is reversed against additional paid-in capital.
Compensation expense recognized with respect to restricted stock
awards during the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and
2004 was approximately $219,000 and $28million, and
$46million respectively.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS   
Stock Incentive Plan In December 1997, the board of directors adopted, and the
stockholders of Quanta approved, the 1997 Stock Option Plan. In
May 2000, the 1997 Stock Option Plan was amended to expand the
definition of Stock to include Quantas
SeriesA Convertible Preferred Stock, common stock and
Limited VoteCommon Stock. In May 2001, the 1997 Stock
Option Plan was amended and renamed the 2001 Stock Incentive 61 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Plan. In November 2001, the plan was amended to allow certain
employees to participate. The plan was further amended during
2002 to make explicit the Compensation Committees power to
grant shares of restricted stock in exchange for options and to
reduce the aggregate number of shares available for issuance
under the plan from 15% to 12% of the outstanding shares of
stock. The purpose of the plan is to provide directors, key
employees, officers and certain advisors with additional
incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of
incentive stock options ISOs as defined in Section422 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code,
nonqualified stock options and restricted stock collectively,
the Awards. The amount of ISOs that may be granted under the
2001 Stock Incentive Plan is limited to 3,571,275shares.
The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The
Compensation Committee has, subject to applicable regulation and
the terms of the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the authority to
grant Awards under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, to construe
and interpret the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and to make all
other determinations and take any and all actions necessary or
advisable for the administration of the 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan; provided, however, that Quantas Chief Executive
Officer has the authority to grant restricted stock or
nonqualified stock options to individuals who are not officers,
provided that ithe aggregate number of shares of common
stock issuable upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options
granted in any one calendar quarter does not exceed
100,000shares and the aggregate value of awards of
restricted stock granted in any one calendar quarter does not
exceed $250,000 determined based on the fair market value of the
common stock at the time of the grants, and iithe
aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of non-qualified stock options granted to any
individual in any one calendar quarter does not exceed
20,000shares of common stock and the aggregate value of
awards of restricted stock granted in any one calendar quarter
to any individual does not exceed $25,000 determined based on
the fair market value of the common stock at the time of the
grants. All of Quantas employees including officers,
non-employee directors and certain consultants and advisors are
eligible to receive Awards under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan,
but only employees of Quanta are eligible to receive ISOs.
Awards will be exercisable during the period specified in each
Award agreement and will generally become exercisable in
installments pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the
Compensation Committee. Unless specifically provided otherwise
in the Award agreement, Awards become immediately vested and
exercisable in the event of a change in control as
defined in the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan of Quanta. No option
will remain exercisable later than ten years after the date of
grant or five years in the case of ISOs granted to employees
owning more than 10% of the voting capital stock. 62 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

63 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
On January21, 2003, Quanta offered eligible employees and
consultants the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding
stock options, with an exercise price of $1000 or more, for
restricted shares of Quantas common stock at an exchange
ratio of one share of restricted stock for every 224 option
shares tendered. Of the eligible options pursuant to the offer,
520,267 options were not exchanged. Of those options, 264,683
remain outstanding and will be required to be accounted for
under variable plan accounting under APB Opinion No25.
The weighted average exercise price of these remaining eligible
options is $2540. In the future, to the extent that
Quantas stock price exceeds the exercise price of an
eligible option that was not exchanged, the difference will be
recorded as a non-cash compensation charge with an offset to
additional paid-in capital. No charges have been recorded with
respect to these options under variable plan accounting through
December31, 2004.   
Restricted Stock As discussed above, Quanta offered eligible employees and
consultants the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding
stock options for restricted shares of Quantas common
stock. Regardless of the vesting schedule of the eligible
options offered for exchange, the restricted stock granted in
the offer typically vests over three years on February 28 of
each year, beginning February28, 2004, assuming the
employee or consultant continues to meet the requirements for
vesting. On March10, 2003, Quanta accepted for exchange
and canceled eligible options to purchase an aggregate of
6,769,483shares of its common stock. Pursuant to the 2001
Stock Incentive Plan discussed above, Quanta granted
95,903shares, 3,431,354shares, and
799,510shares of restricted stock with a weighted average
grant price of $327, $310 and $702, respectively, during the
years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004. As of
December31, 2003 and 2004, 32million and
24million shares of unvested restricted stock were
outstanding. The non-cash compensation expense recognized with
respect to all restricted stock during the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 was approximately
$219,000, $28million and $46million.   
Employee Stock Purchase Plan An Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP was adopted by the
board of directors of Quanta and was approved by the
stockholders of Quanta in May 1999. The purpose of the ESPP is
to provide an incentive for employees of Quanta and any
Participating Company as defined in the ESPP to acquire or
increase a proprietary interest in Quanta through the purchase
of shares of Quantas common stock. At the date hereof, all
of the existing domestic subsidiaries of Quanta have been
designated as Participating Companies. The ESPP is intended to
qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under
Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended the Code. The provisions of the ESPP are construed in
a manner consistent with the requirements of that section of the
Code. The ESPP is administered by a committee, appointed from
time to time, by the board of directors. The ESPP is not subject
to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended. During 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively, Quanta issued a total of 662,147shares,
1,148,632shares and 537,479, respectively, pursuant to the
ESPP.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS   
Unions Multi-Employer Pension Plans In connection with its collective bargaining agreements with
various unions, Quanta participates with other companies in the
unions multi-employer pension plans. These plans cover all
of Quantas employees who are members of such unions. The
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by
the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes
certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a
multi-employer plan in the event of the employers
withdrawal from, or upon termination of such plan. Quanta has no
plans to withdraw from these plans. The plans do not maintain
information on the net assets and actuarial present value of the
plans unfunded vested benefits allocable to Quanta, and the 64 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
amounts, if any, for which Quanta may be contingently liable,
are not ascertainable at this time. Contributions to all union
multi-employer pension plans by Quanta were approximately
$351million, $418million and $462million
for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004.   
401k Plan Effective February1, 1999, Quanta adopted a 401k plan
pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement
benefits through a collective bargaining agreement may make
contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta will make a
matching cash contribution of 100% of each employees
contribution up to 3% of that employees salary and 50% of
each employees contribution between 3% and 6% of such
employees salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by
law. Prior to joining Quantas 401k plan, certain
subsidiaries of Quanta provided various defined contribution
plans to their employees. Contributions to all non-union defined
contribution plans by Quanta were approximately
$72million, $60million and $55million for
the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   
Leases Quanta leases certain buildings and equipment under
non-cancelable lease agreements including related party leases
as discussed in Note10. The terms of these agreements vary
from lease to lease, including some 65 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following

Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately
$313million, $485million and $518million
for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. Assets under capital leases are included as part
of property and equipment. Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
equipment operating leases. Quanta guarantees the difference
between this residual value and the fair market value of the
underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
December31, 2004, the maximum guaranteed residual value
would have been approximately $1002million. Quanta
believes that no significant payments will be made as a result
of the difference between the fair market value of the leased
equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can
be no assurance that future significant payments will not be
required.   
Litigation Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims
and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These actions typically seek, among other things,
compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract,
property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other
losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all
such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta accrues reserves
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Quanta does not
believe that any of these proceedings, separately or in the
aggregate, would be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Quantas results of operations or financial position.   
Performance Bonds In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide
performance bonds in connection with its contractual
commitments. Quanta has indemnified the surety for any expenses
paid out under these performance bonds. As of December31,
2004, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was
approximately $4815million. 66 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Employment Agreements Quanta has entered into various employment agreements with
certain executives which provide for compensation and certain
other benefits and for severance payments under certain
circumstances. In addition, certain employment agreements
contain clauses which become effective upon a change of control
of Quanta. Upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in
the various employment agreements, Quanta will pay certain
amounts to the employee, which vary with the level of the
employees responsibility.   
Other Quanta has indemnified various parties against specified
liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in
connection with companies previously acquired or disposed of by
Quanta. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the other
party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As
of December31, 2004, Quanta is not aware of circumstances
that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for
material amounts in connection with these transactions. As of December31, 2004, Quanta has agreed to issue up to
$175million in additional letters of credit during 2005
relating to Quantas casualty insurance programs.
