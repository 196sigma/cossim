Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements                    48             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Amkor Technology, Inc.   In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amkor Technology,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. For 2002 and 2001, we
did not audit the combined financial statements of Amkor Technology Philippines,
Inc. formerly Amkor Technology Philippines P1/P2, Inc. and Amkor Technology
Philippines P3/P4, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, referred to herein as
ATP, which combined financial statements reflect total assets of 14% of the
consolidated total assets at December 31,2002 and operating expenses of 14% and
18% of the related consolidated total operating expenses for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 2002. The combined financial statements
of ATP as of December 31, 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2002 were
audited by another auditor whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and
our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
ATP, is based solely on the report of the other auditor. The financial
statements of ATP as of December 31, 2001 and for the year ended December 31,
2001 were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations.
Those independent accountants expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements in their report dated March 19, 2002. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 4 and Note 5, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangibles and No.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amkor
Technology, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements
reflect the elimination of all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions. As discussed further below, we elected early adoption of FASB
Interpretation No. FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities on
July 1, 2003. Accordingly, our investments in variable interest entities in
which we are the primary beneficiary are consolidated. Our investments in
variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are
accounted for under the equity method. Investments in and the operating results
of 20% to 50% owned companies which are not variable interest entities are
included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of
accounting. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46, all investments in and the
operating results of 20% to 50% owned companies were included in the
consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
presentation.
CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. The primary objective of
FIN 46 is to provide guidance on the identification of, and financial reporting
for, entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights; such entities are known as variable interest entities. FIN 46 requires
variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the
variable interest entities and expands disclosure requirements for both variable
interest entities that are consolidated as well as those within which an
enterprise holds a significant variable interest. On July 1, 2003, we elected
early adoption of FIN 46 and have elected not to restate years prior to 2003.
We have variable interests in certain Philippine realty corporations in
which we have a 40% ownership and from whom we lease land and buildings in the
Philippines. Beginning July 1, 2003, we have consolidated these Philippine
realty corporations within our financial statements. As of December 31, 2003,
the combined book value of the assets and liabilities associated with these
Philippine realty corporations included in our consolidated balance sheet were
$210 million and $10 million which excludes an intercompany payable of $218
million which eliminates during consolidation, respectively. There was no net
effect to our consolidated statements of income as a result of the consolidation
of the Philippine realty corporations as these entities were previously
accounted for as equity investments with our proportionate share of gains and
losses recorded in our historical consolidated statements of income. In
addition, the consolidation of Philippine realty companies was treated as a
non-cash transaction.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the majority of our
subsidiaries in Korea and the Philippines, and the foreign currency asset and
liability amounts at these subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at
end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary items which are remeasured
at historical rates. Foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at
average exchange rates in effect during the year, except for expenses related to
balance sheet amounts remeasured at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains
and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary
assets and liabilities are included in other income expense in the period in
which they occur.
The local currency is the functional currency of our subsidiaries in Japan,
Taiwan and China, and the asset and liability amounts of these subsidiaries are
translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. The resulting
translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in the stockholders' equity section of the balance
sheets. Assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the local
currency are remeasured into
54 the local currency prior to translation into U.S. dollars, and the resulting
exchange gains or losses are included in other income expense in the period in
which they occur. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at
average exchange rates in effect during the period.
CONCENTRATIONS AND CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, for which we are subject to credit risk, consist
principally of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities. With respect to accounts receivable, we mitigate our credit risk by
selling primarily to well established companies, performing ongoing credit
evaluations and making frequent contact with customers. We have historically
mitigated our credit risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents through
diversification of our holdings into various high-grade money market accounts.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
Our future results of operations involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could affect future results and cause actual results
to vary materially from historical results include, but are not limited to,
dependence on the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry,
fluctuation in operating results, the decline in average selling prices, our
high leverage and the restrictive covenants contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, our investment in ASI, the absence of significant
backlog in our business, our dependence on international operations and sales,
difficulties integrating acquisitions, our dependence on materials and equipment
suppliers, the increased litigation incident to our business, rapid
technological change, competition, our need to comply with existing and future
environmental regulations, the enforcement of intellectual property rights by or
against us, continued control by existing stockholders and stock price
volatility.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
principally by using a moving average method. We order raw materials based on
the customers' forecasted demand and we do not maintain any finished goods
inventory. If our customers change their forecasted requirements and we are
unable to cancel our raw materials order or if our vendor requires that we order
a minimum quantity that exceeds the current forecasted demand, we will
experience a build-up in raw material inventory. We will either seek to recover
the cost of the materials from our customers or utilize the inventory in
production. However, we may not be successful in recovering the cost from our
customers or successful in being able to use the inventory in production, which
we would consider as part of our reserve estimate. Our reserve for excess and
obsolete inventory is based on the forecasted demand we receive from our
customers and the age of our inventory. When a determination is made that the
inventory will not be utilized in production it is written-off and disposed.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets. Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes. Depreciable
lives follow                       
Buildings and improvements..   10 to 30 years
Machinery and equipment..    3 to 7 years
Furniture, fixtures and other equipment.   3 to 10 years   Effective with the fourth quarter of 2002, we changed the estimated useful
lives of certain packaging equipment from four years to seven years for
depreciation purposes, which is in line with our historical usage. This change
increased our 2003 net income by approximately $62 million, or $037 per share,
and decreased our 2002 net loss by approximately $167 million, or $010 per
share. The offsetting impact to our tax provision in 2003 and 2002 related to
the change in useful lives was immaterial due to tax holidays in certain tax
jurisdictions and due to our recognition of valuation allowances against net
operating loss carryforwards in certain other tax jurisdictions see Note 17.
55   Cost and accumulated depreciation for property retired or disposed of are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in
earnings. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation expense related to continuing operations was $2110
million, $3156 million and $3545 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES
Goodwill is recorded when the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair
market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. On
January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
see Note 5. The standard requires that goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets no longer be amortized. In addition, goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.
These tests are performed more frequently if warranted. Impairment losses are
recorded when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
Such impairment losses are recorded as a part of income from continuing
operations.
Definite-lived intangible assets include acquired patents and technology
rights and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. We continually evaluate
the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. The unamortized balances
recorded for acquired intangibles are evaluated periodically for potential
impairment. An impairment loss, if any, would be measured as the excess of the
carrying value over the fair value.
OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS
Other noncurrent assets consist principally of deferred income taxes and
tax credits, deferred debt issuance costs and refundable security deposits. As
discussed in Note 17, we have established valuation allowances against the
majority of our deferred tax assets.
At December 31, 2002, other noncurrent assets included $60 million for the
cash surrender value of life insurance policies in which the beneficiary was our
Chairman and CEO. In December 2003, our Chairman and CEO paid to us $60 million
for this asset, the book value and fair value of the asset at that time, and
accordingly, no balance exists at December 31, 2003.
DUE FROM AND TO AFFILIATES
At December 31, 2002, due from affiliates primarily related to advances
made to Philippine realty companies in which we own 40%. Such investment was
previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Beginning on
July 1, 2003, we have consolidated these entities within our consolidated
financial statement in accordance with FIN 46. Accordingly, this advance now
eliminates during consolidation. The affiliated entities have no long-term
obligations other than their obligations to us and we have not extended
guarantees or other commitments to the entities. Due to affiliates primarily
relates to our transactions with Anam Semiconductor, Inc. see Note 8. Due from
affiliates of $01 million and $03 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, are included in accounts receivable - other.
DEBT EXTINGUISHMENTS
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of
FASB Statement 13, and Technical Corrections as of April 2002. SFAS 145
provides guidance for income statement classification of gains and losses on
extinguishments of debt. Such gains and losses must be analyzed to determine if
they meet the criteria for extraordinary item classification based on the event
being both unusual and infrequent. We adopted SFAS 145 beginning January 1,
2003. During 2003, we charged $241 million of debt premiums, $111 million of
associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs and $25 million of other
debt retirement costs to other income expense, net. During 2001, we charged
$134 million of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs to other income
expense, net.
OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES
Other noncurrent liabilities consist primarily of Korean severance plan
obligations, Philippine pension obligations and
56 noncurrent income taxes payable.
RECEIVABLE FROM STOCKHOLDERS
Amkor Electronics, Inc. AEI, which was merged into our company just prior
to the initial public offering of our company in May 1998, elected to be taxed
as an S Corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
and comparable state tax provisions. As a result, AEI did not recognize U.S.
federal corporate income taxes. Instead, the stockholders of AEI were taxed on
their proportionate share of AEI taxable income. Accordingly, no provision for
U.S. federal income taxes was recorded for AEI. Just prior to the initial public
offering, AEI terminated its S Corporation status at which point the profits of
AEI became subject to federal and state income taxes at the corporate level. We
consummated a tax indemnification agreement between us, our predecessor and
James Kim and his family collectively, the Kim Family. James Kim, is our
founder and significant stockholder, and currently serves as our Chairman and
CEO. Under the terms of the tax indemnification agreement, Amkor indemnified the
former owners of AEI for the settlement of AEI S Corporation federal and state
tax returns and any adjustments to the reported taxable income. During 2003, all
tax years in which AEI filed U.S. federal income tax returns are closed and,
accordingly, are no longer subject to review.
At the time AEI was converted to a C Corporation, AEI and the Kim Family
identified certain federal and state tax overpayments associated with the
results of AEI during S Corporation status years, and AEI, in May 1998, paid
such amounts to the Kim Family. These amounts, which principally related to the
finalization of AEI federal tax return, have been reflected as a receivable
from stockholders in the stockholders' equity section of our balance sheets.
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the receivable was collected in full.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND RISK OF LOSS
Our company does not take ownership of customer-supplied semiconductor
wafers. Title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials at
all times. Accordingly, the cost of the customer-supplied materials is not
included in the consolidated financial statements. Revenues from packaging
semiconductors and performing test services are recognized upon shipment or
completion of the services. Such policies are consistent with provisions in the
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.
STOCK COMPENSATION
We apply Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, to our stock option
plans. These stock option plans are discussed more fully in Note 19, Stock
Compensation Plans. No compensation expense has been recognized for our
employee stock options that have been granted. If compensation costs for our
stock option plans had been determined using the fair value method of accounting
as set forth in SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, our
reported net income loss and per share amount would have been increased
decreased.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and per
share amounts as if the fair value based method had been applied to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period. Refer to Note 19 for a
discussion of the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options
granted.                                   FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

our tax provision related to the pro forma Black-Scholes stock option expense
because of our consolidated net losses for 2003 and 2002 and our associated
recognition of valuation allowances against net operating loss carryforwards
see Note 17.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development expenses include costs directly attributable to
the conduct of research and development programs primarily related to the
development of new package designs and improving the efficiency and capabilities
of our existing production process. Such costs include salaries, payroll taxes,
employee benefit costs, materials, supplies, depreciation on and maintenance of
research equipment, fees under licensing agreements, services provided by
outside contractors, and the allocable portions of facility costs such as rent,
utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, depreciation and general support
services. All costs associated with research and development are expensed as
incurred.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In May 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards
for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 was effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise
was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June
15, 2003. In November 2003, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150-3,
which deferred indefinitely the measurement provisions of SFAS 150 for certain
mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests that were issued before November
5, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material effect on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132 revised 2003, Employers'
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. This statement
requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and
net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other
postretirement plans. The statement does not change the measurement or
recognition of pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. For
domestic plans, the new disclosures are generally effective for periods ending
after December 15, 2003. For foreign plans, the new disclosures are generally
effective for periods ending after June 15, 2004. All of our defined benefit
pension plans are foreign. The adoption of SFAS No. 132 revised 2003 is not
expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.
2.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On February 28, 2003, we sold our wafer fabrication services business to
ASI. Additionally, we obtained a release from Texas Instruments regarding our
contractual obligations with respect to wafer fabrication services to be
performed subsequent to the transfer of the business to ASI. We restated our
historical results to reflect our wafer fabrication services segment as a
discontinued operation. In connection with the disposition of our wafer
fabrication business, we recorded, during the first quarter of 2003, $10
million in severance and other exit costs to close our wafer fabrication
services operations in Boise, Idaho and Lyon, France. Also in the first quarter
of 2003, we recognized a pre-tax gain on the disposition of our wafer
fabrication services business of $586 million or $515 million net of $71
million of associated tax expense. The carrying value of the sold net assets
associated with the business as of February 28, 2003 was $24 million.
A summary of the results from discontinued operations for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are as follows                    58                                        FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No. 121. This standard
provides a single accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale and establishes additional criteria that would have to be met to classify
an asset as held for sale. The carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group.
Estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long-lived
asset or asset group must incorporate the entity own assumptions about its use
of the asset or asset group and must factor in all available evidence. SFAS No.
144 requires that long-lived assets be tested for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be
recoverable. Such events include significant under-performance relative to the
expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes
in the manner of use of the assets; significant negative industry or economic
trends and significant changes in market capitalization.
During 2001, the semiconductor industry declined an unprecedented 32 which impacted the utilization rates of our packaging and test assets. During
the second quarter of 2002, total packaging and test revenues grew over 21% as
compared to the first quarter of 2002. We experienced significant recovery in
most of our company packaging services. However, at that time, our test
services assets and several packaging services assets   -  did not contribute significantly to the growth experienced during the
second quarter of 2002                    59   -  remained at low utilization rates relative to our projections and
-  were no longer expected to reach previously anticipated utilization
levels.
In addition, as of June 30, 2002, we experienced a 72% decline in our market
capitalization as compared to March 31, 2002. These events triggered an
impairment review in accordance with SFAS No. 144. This review included a
company-wide evaluation of underutilized assets and a detailed update of our
operating and cash flow projections.
Based on our company-wide evaluation of underutilized assets during 2002,
we identified $198 million of test and packaging assets to be disposed. We
recognized an $187 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of
the test and packaging fixed assets to be disposed to their fair value less cost
to sell. Fair value of the assets to be disposed was determined with the
assistance of an appraisal firm and available information on the resale value of
the equipment. As of December 31, 2003, we have disposed of all of the
identified test and packaging assets.
Upon the completion of the process to identify the packaging and test net
assets to be disposed, we reviewed our assets to be held and used for
impairment. Based on the June 30, 2002 operating and cash flow projections, we
determined that the carrying value of our test services assets and several
packaging services assets being held and used, including intangible assets that
we are amortizing, exceeded the anticipated cash flows attributable to those
assets. We grouped our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at
the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of
the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For our company, the lowest
level of identifiable cash flows is at the test reporting unit level and for our
packaging services reporting unit at the package type level.
Our test reporting unit and the outsourced integrated circuit test services
industry were adversely impacted by excess capacity at the large integrated
device manufacturers. We expected that when the semiconductor industry recovered
the integrated device manufacturers' demand for outsourced test services would
also recover. However, that anticipated recovery failed to materialize in
connection with the initial recovery we noted in the semiconductor industry
during the first half of 2002 due to continued excess test capacity held by the
large integrated device manufacturers. We no longer expected that the demand for
our test services on our existing technology platforms would return to the
previously anticipated rates. Several of our package types based on more mature
technologies and processes, including older leadframe and laminate package
types, were adversely impacted by a technology shift to matrix and high density
leadframes and the movement from multi-layer laminate substrates to tape and
chip arrays and stacked-die packages. We expected that when the semiconductor
industry recovered there would still be sufficient demand for these more mature
products. However, that anticipated recovery failed to materialize in connection
with the initial recovery we noted in the semiconductor industry during the
first half of 2002 due to these technology shifts and the related significant
excess capacity in the industry. We no longer expected that the demand for these
package types would return to the previously anticipated rates. Additionally, we
experienced insufficient demand related to select investments in advanced
package technologies principally as a result of alternative advanced package
technologies which became industry standard.
As of June 30, 2002, we recognized a $1716 million impairment charge to
reduce the carrying value of test and packaging assets to be held and used to
their fair value. The components of this charge were as follows                                     CARRYING      FAIR      IMPAIRMENT

$    2531  $    815   $    1716
An appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value
of the assets held for use. The determination of fair value was based on
projected cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved.
5. SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, which
prohibits the pooling-of-interests method
60 of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and
addresses the accounting for purchase method business combinations completed
after June 30, 2001. Also in June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. For existing acquisitions, the provisions of SFAS
No. 142 were effective as of January 1, 2002 and are generally effective for
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 includes
provisions regarding the reclassification of certain existing recognized
intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized
intangibles, the cessation of amortization related to goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles, and the testing for impairment of goodwill and
other intangibles annually or more frequently if circumstances warrant.
Additionally, SFAS No. 142 requires that within six months of adoption of SFAS
No. 142, goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level as of the
date of adoption.
We adopted SFAS No. 142 as of January 1, 2002 and we reclassified $300
million of intangible assets previously identified as an assembled workforce
intangible to goodwill. Additionally, at adoption of SFAS No. 142 we stopped
amortizing goodwill of $6591 million, as well as goodwill of $1186 million
associated with our investment in ASI then accounted for under the equity method
of accounting. The as adjusted financial information below assumes that the
cessation of amortization occurred as of January 1, 2001.                                  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

As of the adoption date of the standard, we reassessed the useful lives of
our identified intangibles and they continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and
other intangible assets are attributable to two reporting units, packaging and
test services. Goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit proportionate to the
fair values of the acquired packaging and test assets. We completed the initial
impairment test during the second quarter of 2002. Based on the comparison of
the fair value of the reporting units with their respective carrying values each
as of January 1, 2002, we concluded that goodwill associated with our packaging
and test services reporting units was not impaired as of adoption. An appraisal
firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of our
reporting units. The determination of fair value was based on projected cash
flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved.
SFAS No. 142 provides that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for
impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances
including a significant adverse change in the business climate and testing for
recoverability of long-lived assets. Our test services assets and several
packaging services assets remained at low utilization rates during the second
quarter of 2002 and were no longer expected to reach previously anticipated
utilization levels. As discussed in Note 4, we tested the recoverability of such
assets as of June 30, 2002 and concluded that a portion of those assets was
impaired. Accordingly, we retested goodwill for impairment as of June 30, 2002,
and concluded that the carrying value of the assets and liabilities associated
with the test services reporting unit exceeded its fair value. As of June 30,
2002, we recognized a $731 million goodwill impairment charge. Such impairment
charge was measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill
associated with the test services reporting unit to its carrying value. An
appraisal firm was engaged to assist in the determination of the fair value of
our reporting units. The determination of fair value was based on projected cash
flows using a
61 discount rate commensurate with the risk involved. During the second quarter of
2003, we performed our annual review for impairment and concluded that goodwill
was not impaired.

6.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During 2002, we recorded $286 million of charges related to the
consolidation of our worldwide facilities to increase operational efficiency and
reduce costs. The charges were comprised of $208 million to write-off leasehold
improvements and other long-lived assets and $78 million for lease termination
and other exit costs. Our consolidation efforts included   -  Transferring the packaging operations at our K2 site in Bucheon, South
Korea into our K4 factory in Kwangju, South Korea and closing the K2
facility   -  Merging our factory operations in Taiwan into a single location, and
-  Consolidating select U.S. office locations and closing our San Jose
test facility.
The 2002 charges associated with the consolidation initiatives in Korea,
Taiwan and the U.S. were $100 million, $138 million and $48 million,
respectively. We completed the closing of the K2 facility during the second
quarter of 2003 and the other activities were substantially completed during
2002. Of the total $286 million restructuring charges recorded in 2002, $22
million and $61 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002, respectively, and is reflected in accrued expenses and other
noncurrent liabilities. The outstanding liability is principally future lease
payments of which $10 million is expected be paid during 2004. The remaining
lease payments are expected to be paid through 2007 unless the leases can be
terminated earlier. During 2003, the restructuring reserve was reduced by $20
million for cash expenditures and $19 million for the settlement of a
previously existing contingency.
7.  ACQUISITIONS IN JAPAN AND TAIWAN
In April 2002, we acquired the semiconductor packaging business of Citizen
Watch Co., Ltd. located in the Iwate prefecture in Japan. The purchase price
included a $78 million cash payment at closing. We were required to make
additional payments one year from closing for the amount of the deferred
purchase price as well as contingent payments. Based on the resolution of the
contingency as of January 2003, the total amount of additional payments due in
April 2003 was 17 billion Japanese yen. In April 2003, we made a payment of
3000 million Japanese yen, or $25 million based on the exchange rate on the
date of the payment. We are withholding payment of 14 billion yen $131
million based on the spot exchange rate at December 31, 2003 of this amount
pending resolution of a controversy relating to the patents acquired in
connection with the acquisition. We recorded $196 million of intangible assets
for patent rights that are amortizable over 7 years. The fair value of the other
assets acquired and liabilities assumed was approximately $25 million for fixed
assets, $01 million for inventory and other assets and $142 million for the
deferred purchase price payment and minimum amount of the contingent payments.
Such net assets principally relate to our packaging services reporting unit.
In January 2002, we acquired Agilent Technologies, Inc. packaging
business related to semiconductor packages utilized in printers for $28 million
in cash. The purchase price was principally allocated to the tangible assets of
our packaging services reporting unit. Our results of operations were not
significantly impacted by this acquisition.
62   In July 2001, we acquired, in separate transactions, 69% of Taiwan
Semiconductor Technology Corporation TSTC and Sampo Semiconductor
Corporation Sampo in Taiwan. Including our prior ownership interest in TSTC,
our ownership increased to 94% of the outstanding shares of TSTC. The combined
purchase price was paid with the issuance of 49 million shares of our common
stock valued at $879 million based on our closing share price two days prior to
each acquisition, the assumption of $348 million of debt and $37 million of
cash consideration, net of acquired cash. We recorded intangible assets,
principally goodwill, of $238 million as of the acquisition date that is
nonamortizable. In connection with earn-out provisions that provided for
additional purchase price based in part on the results of the acquisitions, we
issued an additional 18 million shares in January 2002 and recorded an
additional $352 million in goodwill.
In January 2001, Amkor Iwate Corporation commenced operations and acquired
from Toshiba a packaging and test facility located in the Iwate prefecture in
Japan. We owned 60% of Amkor Iwate and Toshiba owned the balance of the
outstanding shares. At December 31, 2003, our minority interest in Amkor Iwate
of $118 million was recorded as a liability in accrued expenses, in accordance
with SFAS No. 150. In January 2004, we acquired the remaining 40% ownership
interest of Amkor Iwate from Toshiba for approximately 14 billion Japanese yen
$128 million based on the spot exchange rate at December 31, 2003. Also in
January 2004, we paid to Toshiba 2200 million Japanese yen or $20 million
based on the spot exchange rate at December 31, 2003 to terminate our
commitment to purchase a tract of land adjacent to the Amkor Iwate facility. A
$20 million charge was recorded in special charges see Note 3 during the
fourth quarter of 2003 related to this termination fee. Amkor Iwate provides
packaging and test services principally to Toshiba Iwate factory under a
long-term supply agreement that provides for services to be performed on a cost
plus basis through December 2003 and then at market based rates beginning
January 2004. This long-term supply agreement with Toshiba Iwate factory
terminates January 2006.
The results of our acquisitions have been included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates.
8.  OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ANAM SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. ASI AND INVESTMENT IN ASI
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ASI
We have had a long-standing relationship with ASI. ASI was founded in 1956
by Mr. H. S. Kim, the father of Mr. James Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer. Through former supply agreements with ASI, we historically
subcontracted for packaging and test services which were sourced from ASI
factories in Korea. Beginning in May 2000, with the completion of our
acquisitions of ASI packaging and test facilities, we no longer receive
packaging and test services from ASI. In connection with the acquisition of
these factories, we committed to making equity investments in ASI, and as a
result, accumulated a 42% ownership interest in ASI. Under the former wafer
fabrication services supply agreement, we purchased the wafer output of ASI
wafer fabrication facility. Beginning in February 2003, when we sold our wafer
fabrication services business to ASI, we no longer purchase ASI wafer output.
In addition, we have had other relationships with ASI affiliated companies for
construction services and equipment. We believe each of these transactions was
conducted on an arms-length basis in the ordinary course of business. Total
purchases from ASI and its affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 were $311 million, $2126 million and $1616 million.
Construction services and equipment purchases received from ASI and its
affiliates capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were
$28 million and $147 million, respectively. We received less than $01 million
of construction services from ASI and its affiliates during 2003.
OUR INVESTMENT IN ASI
We evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value
that are considered other than temporary. In the event of a determination that a
decline in market value is other than temporary, a charge to earnings is
recorded for the unrealized loss, and a new cost basis in the investment is
established. The stock prices of semiconductor companies' stocks, including ASI
and its competitors, have experienced significant volatility during the past
several years. The most recent downturn in the semiconductor industry affected
the demand for the wafer output from ASI foundry and the market value of ASI
stock as traded on the Korea Stock Exchange. As a result, we recorded $1725
million of impairment charges during 2002 to reduce the carrying value of our
investment in ASI to ASI market value. At January 1, 2001 and 2002 Amkor owned
42% of ASI voting stock. During 2002, we divested 21 million shares of ASI
stock and at December 31, 2002, Amkor owned 267 million shares of ASI or 21%.
The carrying value of our investment in ASI at December 31, 2002
63 was $775 million, or $290 per share. As discussed further below, on March 24,
2003 we sold 7 million shares of ASI common stock. Beginning on this date we
ceased accounting for our investment in ASI under the equity method of
accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable security
that is available for sale. As of December 31, 2003, we owned 147 million
shares of ASI, or 12% of ASI voting stock. The carrying value of our remaining
investment in ASI at December 31, 2003, including an unrealized gain of $100,
was $504 million, or $343 per share. We intend to sell our remaining
investment in ASI. The ultimate level of proceeds from the sale of our remaining
investment in ASI could be less than the current carrying value.
As part of our strategy to sell our investment in ASI and to divest our
wafer fabrication services business see Note 2, we entered into a series of
transactions beginning in the second half of 2002 -  In September 2002, we sold 20 million shares of ASI common stock to Dongbu
Group in exchange for 5700 Korean won per share, the market value of ASI
common stock as traded on the Korean Stock Exchange at the time we entered
into the share sale agreement. We received $581 million in net cash
proceeds and 42 billion won approximately $342 million based on the spot
exchange rate on the closing date of interest bearing notes from Dongbu
Corporation payable in two equal principal payments in September 2003 and
February 2004. The Dongbu Group comprises Dongbu Corporation, Dongbu Fire
Insurance Co., Ltd. and Dongbu Life Insurance Co., Ltd., all of which are
Korean corporations and are collectively referred to herein as Dongbu.
Associated with this transaction, we recorded a $18 million loss.
Additionally, we divested one million shares of ASI common stock in
connection with the payment of certain advisory fees related to this
transaction. On September 30, 2003, we received 21 billion won
approximately $183 million based on the September 30, 2003 spot exchange
rate, consisting of the principal amount due under the notes from Dongbu. -  In separate transactions designed to facilitate a future merger between ASI
and Dongbu, i we acquired a 10% interest in Acqutek from ASI for $19
million, the market value of the shares as publicly traded in Korea; ii
we acquired the Precision Machine Division PMD of Anam Instruments, a
related party to Amkor, for $8 million, its fair value; and iii Anam
Instruments, which had been partially owned by ASI, utilized the proceeds
from the sale of PMD to us to buy back all of the Anam Instruments shares
owned by ASI. Acqutek supplies materials to the semiconductor industry and
is publicly traded in Korea. An entity controlled by the family of James
Kim, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, held a 25% ownership
interest in Acqutek at the time of our acquisition of our interest in
Acqutek. We have historically purchased and continue to purchase leadframes
from Acqutek. On September 17, 2003, we sold our entire ownership interest
in Acqutek see Note 12. PMD supplies sophisticated die mold systems and
tooling to the semiconductor industry and historically over 90% of its
sales were to Amkor. We determined the fair value of PMD based on projected
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. At the
time of our acquisition of PMD, Anam Instruments was owned 20% by ASI and
20% by a family member of James Kim. -  On February 28, 2003, we sold our wafer fabrication services business to
ASI for $62 million. We negotiated the fair value of our wafer fabrication
services business with ASI and Dongbu. The parties calculated fair value
based on an assessment of projected cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. We obtained a release from Texas
Instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to wafer
fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the
business to ASI.
Each of the transactions with Dongbu, ASI and Anam Instruments are
interrelated and it is possible that if each of the transactions were viewed on
a stand-alone basis without regard to the other transactions, we could have had
different conclusions as to fair value. It is likely that we would not have
entered into the Acqutek or PMD transactions absent the share sale to Dongbu and
the sale of the wafer fabrication services business to ASI. Had these
transactions not been interrelated, we may have utilized a different negotiation
strategy for the investment in Acqutek and the acquisition of PMD, which could
have resulted in us reaching a different conclusion of the fair value of both of
these transactions.
Pursuant to the definitive agreements, 1 Amkor and Dongbu agreed to use
reasonable best efforts to cause Dongbu Electronics and ASI to be merged
together as soon as practicable, 2 Amkor and Dongbu agreed to cause ASI to use
the proceeds ASI received from its sale of stock to Dongbu to purchase shares in
Dongbu Electronics and 3 Amkor and Dongbu agreed to use their best efforts to
provide releases and indemnifications to the chairman, directors and officers of
ASI, either past or incumbent, from any and all liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties at ASI between January 1, 1995 and December 31,
2001. The last provision would provide a release and indemnification for James
Kim, our CEO and Chairman, and members of his family. We are not aware of any
claims or other liabilities which these individuals would be released from or
for which they would receive indemnification.
64   Subsequent to the sale of a portion of our investment in ASI to Dongbu in
2002, we were unable to identify another strategic buyer. ASI common stock,
which is listed on the Korean Stock Exchange, is relatively thinly traded and
subject to volatile swings in daily trading volumes. In an effort to continue to
monetize our investment in ASI common stock, we evaluated, in consultation
with a financial institution, the most efficient method to divest a large block
of shares into the market without destabilizing the share price of ASI common
stock. On March 24, 2003, we consummated a series of transactions proposed by a
financial institution. We irrevocably sold a block of 7 million shares of ASI
common stock to the financial institution for approximately $195 million, or
$281 per share. We also entered into a nondeliverable call option with the
financial institution for $68 million, the fair value of the option at that
date plus the transaction costs. In May 2003, we exercised the nondeliverable
call option realizing $56 million of cash proceeds. Accordingly, during 2003 we
recorded a loss of $12 million related to this nondeliverable call option.
On September 17, 2003, we sold an additional 5 million shares of ASI common
stock to the same financial institution for approximately $185 million, or
$369 per share, and recorded an associated gain of $47 million. We also
entered into a nondeliverable call option with the financial institution for
$65 million, the fair value of the option at that date plus the transaction
costs. In December 2003, we exercised the nondeliverable call option realizing
$20 million of cash proceeds. Accordingly, during 2003 we recorded a loss of
$45 million related to this nondeliverable call option.
The March and September 2003 call options discussed above allowed us to
continue to monetize our investment in ASI at a fixed price with unlimited
upside and limited downside economics. In addition, it provided us with the
economic benefits of selling shares through a dollar averaging sales program
without incurring the transaction costs associated with multiple small quantity
sales. The call premiums provided the financial institution some downward
protection if the market for ASI common stock destabilized as it sold its
investment in ASI common stock into the market. All ownership rights and
privileges associated with the 12 million shares of ASI common stock sold
during 2003 were irrevocably transferred to the financial institution. In no
event could the financial institution have put the shares back to Amkor nor was
there a provision in the agreements for Amkor to reacquire the shares.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR ASI
The following summary of consolidated financial information was derived
from the consolidated financial statements of ASI. As discussed above, on March
24, 2003, we ceased accounting for our investment in ASI under the equity method
of accounting and commenced accounting for our investment as a marketable
security that is available for sale. Accordingly, summary consolidated financial
information related to ASI is only presented for the periods in which ASI was a

In connection with the disposition of a portion of our interest in ASI, we
acquired a 10% interest in Acqutek from ASI for a total purchase price of $19
million see Note 8. Our investment in Acqutek was classified as a marketable
security available for sale at December 31, 2002. In September 2003, our
investment in Acqutek was sold at a loss of $03 million. Previous to the sale
of Acqutek, we recorded during the second quarter of 2003 a $09 million charge
to earnings to reflect the decline in market value of Acqutek, which was
considered to be other than temporary. Total purchases from Acqutek included in
cost of revenue for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $161 million, $160 million and
$140 million, respectively, which we believe were conducted on an arms-length
basis in the ordinary course of business.
In November 2003, we sold our investment in an intellectual property
company which was classified as available for sale. This investment was sold for
$98 million and we recorded an associated gain of $73 million in other
income expense, net.
Equity investment losses, as recorded in our consolidated statements of
income, are comprised of the following                               FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

$ 1,650,707  $ 1,737,690
On April 22, 2003, we entered into a new $2000 million senior secured
credit facility consisting of a $1700 million term loan maturing January 31,
2006 and a $300 million revolving line of credit that is available through
October 31, 2005. The term loan principal repayments are due $17 million 1254 million and $416 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. In
addition, the term loan includes certain financial covenants including, but not
limited to, minimum EBITDA, as defined by the credit facility, minimum daily
liquidity and maximum annual capital expenditures. A default under one debt
instrument may also trigger cross-defaults under our other debt instruments.
This new credit facility replaced the previous $1969 million secured credit
facility, which included a $969 million term loan and a $1000 million
revolving credit facility that were scheduled to mature September 30, 2005 and
March 31, 2005, respectively. The funds available under this new credit facility
were used to repay the $969 million term loan outstanding under the existing
credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the
redemption of our term loan, we recorded a charge of $24 million during the
second quarter of 2003 for the associated unamortized deferred debt issuance
costs.
In May 2003, we sold $4250 million of 775% senior notes due May 2013
original notes. We sold these notes to qualified institutional investors and
used the net proceeds of the issuance to redeem our outstanding 925% senior
notes due 2006. The notes have a coupon rate of 775 % annually and interest
payments are due semi-annually. In connection with the redemption, we recorded
charges during the second quarter of 2003 of $197 million related to the
premium paid to redeem these notes, $60 million for the associated unamortized
deferred debt issuance costs and $25 million of other costs.
In connection with the original notes, we entered into a registration
rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the original notes. In the
exchange offer, the original note holders were entitled to exchange their
original notes for exchange notes exchange notes, with substantially
identical terms as the original notes. In July 2003, we filed a Form S-4
Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to effect
this exchange offer which became effective October 22, 2003.
During 2003, we received board of director approval to purchase up to
$1500 million of the 925% senior notes due 2008, and we have been purchasing
these notes in the open market. As of December 31, 2003, we purchased $295
million of the 925% senior notes due 2008 for which we recognized a loss on
this retirement of debt of $16 million and a charge of $04 million for the
associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs during 2003.
In November 2003, we repurchased $1123 million of our 500% convertible
subordinated notes due March 2007 and $170 million of our 575% convertible
subordinated notes due June 2006. In connection with the redemption of these
convertible notes, we recorded charges during the fourth quarter of 2003 of $28
million related to premiums paid to redeem these notes and $23 million for the
associated unamortized deferred debt issuance costs.
68   Other debt as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 includes our foreign debt
principally related to the financing of Amkor Iwate acquisition of a Toshiba
packaging and test facility and the debt assumed in connection with the
acquisition of Sampo Semiconductor Corporation in Taiwan. Our foreign debt
includes fixed and variable debt maturing between 2003 and 2010, with the
substantial majority maturing by 2003. As of December 31, 2003, the foreign debt
has interest rates ranging from 10% to 435%. These debt instruments do not
include significant financial covenants.
Interest expense related to short-term borrowings and long term debt is
presented net of interest income of $59 million, $42 million and $103 million
for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. The principal payments required under short-term and
long-term debt borrowings at December 31, 2003 are as follows: 2004 -- $287
million, 2005 -- $1290 million, 2006 -- $2775 million, 2007 -- $1472 million,
2008 -- $4711 million and thereafter -- $6259 million.
15. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
In connection with a $4100 million private equity offering in May 2000, we
issued 205 million shares of our common stock and granted warrants that expire
four years from issuance to purchase 39 million additional shares of our common
stock at $2750 per share. None of these warrants have been exercised to date.
The estimated fair value of the stock warrants of $350 million is included in
additional paid-in capital on our consolidated balance sheet.
In November 2003, we sold 74 million shares of our common stock for net
proceeds of $1335 million. These net proceeds were used to repurchase $1123
million of our 500% convertible notes due 2007 and $170 million of our 575%
convertible notes due 2006.
In September 2003, a receivable due to us of $29 million was collected in
full. This receivable was previously reflected as a receivable from stockholders
in the stockholders' equity section of our balance sheet see Note 1.
16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
U.S. Defined Contribution Plan
Our company has a defined contribution benefit plan covering substantially
all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute up to the lesser of 60% of salary
or $12,000 annually to the plan. The company matches in cash 75% of the
employee contributions up to a defined maximum on an annual basis. The expense
for this plan was $17 million, $20 million and $21 million in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively.
Philippine Pension Plan
Our Philippine subsidiary sponsors a defined benefit plan that covers
substantially all employees who are not covered by statutory plans. Charges to
expense are based upon costs computed by independent actuaries.
The components of net periodic pension cost for the Philippine defined
benefit plan are as follows                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Our Korean subsidiary participates in an accrued severance plan that covers
employees and directors with one year or more of service. Eligible plan
participants are entitled to receive a lump-sum payment upon termination of
their employment, based on their length of service and rate of pay at the time
of termination. Accrued severance benefits are estimated assuming all eligible
employees were to terminate their employment at the balance sheet date. The
contributions to the national pension fund made under the National Pension Plan
of the Republic of Korea are deducted from accrued severance benefit
liabilities. Contributed amounts are                    70                                     DECEMBER 31,

TAIWAN PENSION PLAN
Our Taiwan subsidiary sponsors a defined benefit plan that covers
substantially all full-time employees. Charges to expense are based upon costs
computed by independent actuaries. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
projected benefit obligation was $27 million and $21 million, respectively.
Pension assets at fair market value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 were $25
million and $19 million, respectively. Prepaid accrued pension cost at
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $02 million and $05 million, respectively.

Net deferred tax   $   29,302   $   37,197
During 2003 and 2002, we recorded a $207 million and $2148 million charge
to establish a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets
consisting primarily of U.S., Taiwanese and Chinese net operating loss
carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and tax credits. In connection with
our divestiture in 2003 of 12 million shares of ASI common stock and other
investments, we recognized a capital loss of approximately $806 million and
recognized a U.S. tax benefit of $322 million for which we provided a full
valuation allowance because we did not have any offsetting capital gains. In
connection with our divestiture in 2002 of 21 million shares of ASI common
stock, we realized a capital loss of approximately $1170 million and recognized
a U.S. tax benefit of $445 million for which we provided a full valuation
allowance because we did not have any offsetting capital gains. Generally
accepted accounting principles require companies to weigh both positive and
negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance. During
2002, in light of our three years of cumulative losses, an unprecedented
industry downturn and continued poor visibility of customer demand, we
determined that a valuation allowance representing a substantial majority of our
deferred tax assets was appropriate. These negative factors outweighed, and
continued to outweigh in 2003, our forecasted future profitability and
expectation that we will be able to utilize our net operating loss
carryforwards.
As a result of certain capital investments, export commitments and
employment levels, income from operations in Korea, the Philippines and China is
subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes. In
Korea, we benefit from a tax holiday extending through 2013 that provides for a
100% tax holiday for seven years and then 50% tax holiday for an additional 3
years. In the Philippines, our operating locations operate in economic zones and
in exchange for tax holidays we have committed to certain export and employment
levels. For 2004 and beyond, certain qualifying Philippine operations will
benefit from a one year full tax holiday, subject to extension, while the
remaining operations will benefit from a perpetual reduced tax rate of 5%. As a
result of our 2001 investment in China, we expect to benefit from a 100% tax
holiday for five years and then 50% tax holiday for an additional two years. As
a result of the net losses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries subject to tax
holidays during 2003, 2002 and 2001, there is a forgone income tax benefit
attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries of approximately $48
million, or $003 per share, $633 million, or $039 per share and $338
million, or $021 per share in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
73   In December 2002, we utilized $333 million of U.S. net operating losses by
carrying back such amounts to offset U.S. reported taxable income in prior
years. At December 31, 2003, we have remaining U.S. net operating losses
available to be carried forward totaling $4049 million expiring between 2021
and 2023. Additionally, at December 31, 2003, we had non-U.S. net operating
losses available to be carried forward totaling $491 million expiring between
2004 and 2013. Non-U.S. income loss before taxes and minority interest was
$534 million, $3953 million and $1807 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, net cumulative undistributed losses
of non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $81 million and $614 million,
respectively. No liabilities are recognized for our cumulative earnings loss
position and no U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes would be due on the
cumulative earnings loss. It is the company intention to reinvest any
undistributed earnings outside the U.S.
At December 31, 2003 and 2002 current deferred tax assets of $23 million
and $55 million, respectively, are included in other current assets and
noncurrent deferred tax assets of $285 million and $363 million, respectively,
are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The net deferred
tax assets include amounts, which, in our opinion, are more likely than not to
be realizable through future taxable income. In addition, at December 31, 2003
and 2002, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $15 million and $46 million,
respectively, are included in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet.
We operate in and file income tax returns in various U.S. and non-U.S.
jurisdictions which are subject to examination by tax authorities. For our
larger operations, our tax returns have been examined through 1998 in the
Philippines and the U.S. and through 2000 in Japan and Taiwan. The tax returns
for open years in all jurisdictions in which we do business are subject to
changes upon examination. During 2003, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an
examination related to years 2001 and 2000. We believe that we have estimated
and provided adequate accruals for the probable additional taxes and related
interest expense that may ultimately result from examinations related to our
transfer pricing and local attribution of income resulting from significant
intercompany transactions, including ownership and use of intellectual property,
in various U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our estimated tax liability is
subject to change as examinations of specific tax years are completed in the
respective jurisdictions. We believe that any additional taxes or related
interest over the amounts accrued will not have a material effect on our
financial condition or results of operations, nor do we expect that examinations
to be completed in the near term would have a material favorable impact. During
2003, we reduced tax accruals by $200 million related to tax periods no longer
open. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the accrual for current taxes and
estimated additional taxes was $398 million and $488 million, respectively. In
addition, changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries, expiration
of tax holidays and changes in tax laws or regulations could result in increased
effective tax rates in the future.
18. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per
Share, requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on
the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed using only the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period, while diluted EPS is
computed assuming conversion of all dilutive securities, such as options,
convertible debt and warrants. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, we excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share potentially
dilutive securities which would have an antidilutive effect on EPS. As of
December 31, 2003, the total number of potentially dilutive securities
outstanding was 158 million, 92 million and 39 million for outstanding
options, convertible notes and warrants for common stock, respectively. As of
December 31, 2002, the total number of potentially dilutive securities
outstanding was 66 million, 117 million and 39 million for outstanding
options, convertible notes and warrants for common stock, respectively. As of
December 31, 2001, the total number of potentially dilutive securities
outstanding was 124 million, 117 million and 39 million for outstanding
options, convertible notes and warrants for common stock, respectively. The
basic and diluted per share amounts are the same for the years 2003, 2002 and
2001 due to net losses from continuing operations.
19. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
1998 Director Option Plan. A total of 300,000 shares of common stock have
been reserved for issuance under the Director Plan. The option grants under the
Director Plan are automatic and non-discretionary. As of January 1, 2003, the
Director Plan provides for an initial grant of options to purchase 20,000 shares
of common stock to each new non-employee director of the company when such
individual first becomes an outside director. In addition, each non-employee
director will automatically be granted subsequent options to purchase 10,000
shares of common stock on each date on which such director
74 is re-elected by the stockholders of the company, provided that as of such date
such director has served on the board of directors for at least six months. The
exercise price of the options is 100% of the fair market value of the common
stock on the grant date. The term of each option is ten years and each option
granted to an non-employee director vests over a three year period. The Director
Plan will terminate in January 2008 unless sooner terminated by the board of
directors.
1998 Stock Plan. The 1998 Stock Plan generally provides for the grant to
employees, directors and consultants of stock options and stock purchase rights.
Unless terminated sooner, the 1998 Plan will terminate automatically in January
2008. A total of 5,000,000 shares are available for issuance under the 1998
Stock Plan, and there is a provision for an annual replenishment to bring the
number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan up to
5,000,000 as of each January 1.
Unless determined otherwise by the board of directors or a committee
appointed by the board of directors, options and stock purchase rights granted
under the 1998 Plan are not transferable by the optionee. Generally, the
exercise price of all stock options granted under the 1998 Plan must be at least
equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. In general,
the options granted will vest over a four year period and the term of the
options granted under the 1998 Plan may not exceed ten years.
On November 8, 2002, we initiated a voluntary stock option replacement
program such that employees and members of our board of directors could elect to
surrender their existing options and be granted new options no earlier than six
months and one day after the tendered options were cancelled. Pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the offer to exchange, a total of 1,633 eligible
employees participated. On June 16, 2003, we granted 6,978,563 shares of our
common stock under the 1998 Stock Plan and 35,000 shares of our common stock
under the 1998 Director Option Plan for the options tendered by eligible
employees and members of our board of directors and accepted by our company. For
options that were granted under the previously existing 1998 French Plan, which
was terminated in April 2003, and that were surrendered pursuant to voluntary
stock option replacement program, we granted an additional 248,200 replacement
options under the 1998 Stock Plan. We have issued new option grants equal to the
same number of shares surrendered by the employees. The exercise price of the
new options was $1079, which was equal to the fair market value of our stock
price on the date of grant. The vesting term of these new options are similar to
the tendered options except the new options contain an additional one-year
vesting period prior to any options becoming exercisable.
2003 Nonstatutory Inducement Grant Stock Plan. On September 9, 2003, we
initiated the 2003 Nonstatutory Inducement Grant Stock Plan the 2003 Plan.
The 2003 Plan generally provides for the grant to employees, directors and
consultants of stock options and stock purchase rights and is generally used as
an inducement benefit for the purpose of retaining new employees. The 2003 Plan
terminates at the discretion of the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2003,
a total of 300,000 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan
and there is a provision for an annual replenishment to bring the number of
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan up to 300,000.

Options outstanding at December 31, 2003..   15,789,570            3,181,757
In order to calculate the fair value of stock options at date of grant, we
used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following assumptions were used
to calculate weighted average fair values of the options granted                 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

stock are available for sale under the Stock Purchase Plan and an annual
increase is to be added as of each January 1 to restore the maximum aggregate
number of shares of common stock available for sale under the plan up to
1,000,000. Employees including officers and employee directors of the company
but excluding 5% or greater stockholders are eligible to participate if they
are customarily employed for at least 20 hours per week. The Stock Purchase Plan
permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions,
which may not exceed 15% of the compensation an employee receives on each
payday. Each participant will be granted an option on the first day of a two
year offering period, and shares of common stock will be purchased on four
purchase dates within the offering period. The purchase price of the common
stock under the Stock Purchase Plan will be equal to 85% of the lesser of the
fair market value per share of common stock on the start date of the offering
period or on the purchase date. Employees may end their participation in an
offering period at any time, and participation ends automatically on termination
of employment with the company. The Stock Purchase Plan will terminate in
January 2008, unless sooner terminated by the board of directors.
For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, employees purchased
common stock shares under the stock purchase plan of 999,827, 996,617 and
482,937, respectively. The average estimated fair values of the purchase rights
granted during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 based on the
Black-Scholes option pricing model were $170, $316 and $653, respectively.

The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using
available market information and appropriate methodologies; however,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates for fair value. Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange.
Certain of these financial instruments are with major financial institutions and
expose us to market and credit risks and may at times be concentrated with
certain counterparties or groups of counterparties. The creditworthiness of
counterparties is continually reviewed, and full performance is anticipated.
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for due from affiliates,
other accounts receivable, due to affiliates, accrued expenses and accrued
income taxes approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
other significant classes of financial instruments is set forth below   Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are due on demand or
carry a maturity date of less than three months when purchased. The carrying
amount of these financial instruments is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Available for sale investments. The fair value of these financial
instruments was estimated based on market quotes, recent offerings of similar
securities, current and projected financial performance of the company and net
asset positions.
Long-term debt. The carrying amount of our total long-term debt as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $1,6507 million and $1,7377, respectively. The
fair value of our total long-term debt as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, based
on available market quotes, was estimated to be $1,7542 million and $1,3213
million, respectively.
21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Amkor is involved in various claims incidental to the conduct of our
business. Based on consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that any
claims, either individually or in the aggregate, to which the company is a party
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.
Net future minimum lease payments under operating leases that have initial
or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are                                 DECEMBER 31,

Pennsylvania from certain of our stockholders. The lease expires in 2006. We
have the option to extend the lease for an additional 10 years through 2016.
Amounts paid for this lease in 2003, 2002 and 2001 were
77 11 million, $12 million and $12 million, respectively. Our sublease income
includes $05 million in each of the three years ended December 31, 2003 from a
company in which certain related parties have ownership interests.
INDEMNIFICATIONS AND GUARANTEES
We have indemnified members of our board of directors and our corporate
officers against any threatened, pending or completed action or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact
that the Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the company. The
indemnities are indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against
related expenses, judgments, fines and any amounts paid in settlement. We also
maintain Directors and Officers insurance coverage in order to mitigate our
exposure to these indemnification obligations. The maximum amount of future
payments is generally unlimited. There is no amount recorded for this
indemnification at December 31, 2003. Due to the nature of this indemnification,
it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss
or range of loss. No assets are held as collateral and no specific recourse
provisions exist related to this indemnification.
As of December 31, 2003, we have outstanding $22 million of standby
letters of credit. Such standby letters of credit are used in our ordinary
course of business and are collateralized by our cash balances.
We generally provide a standard ninety-day warranty on our services. Our
warranty activity has historically been immaterial and is expected to continue
to be immaterial in the foreseeable future.
LITIGATION
We are currently a party to various legal proceedings, including those
noted below. While we currently believe that the ultimate outcome of these
proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations,
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. If an unfavorable ruling were
to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our net
income in the period in which the ruling occurs. The estimate of the potential
impact from the following legal proceedings on our financial position or overall
results of operations could change in the future.
EPOXY MOLD COMPOUND LITIGATION
Recently, we have become party to an increased number of litigation matters
relative to our historic levels. Much of our recent increase in litigation
relates to an allegedly defective epoxy mold compound, formerly used in some of
our products, which is alleged to be responsible for certain semiconductor chip
failures. In the case of each of these matters, we believe we have meritorious
defenses, as well as valid third-party claims against Sumitomo Bakelite Co.,
Ltd. Sumitomo Bakelite, the manufacturer of the challenged epoxy product,
should the epoxy mold compound be found to be defective. We cannot be certain,
however, that we will be able to recover any amount from Sumitomo Bakelite if we
are held liable in these matters, or that any adverse result would not have a
material impact upon us. Moreover, other customers of ours have made inquiries
about the epoxy mold compound, which was widely used in the semiconductor
industry, and no assurance can be given that claims similar to those already
asserted will not be made against us by other customers in the future.
Fujitsu Limited v. Cirrus Logic, Inc., et al.
On April 16, 2002, we were served with a third-party complaint in an action
entitled Fujitsu Limited v. Cirrus Logic, Inc., No. 02-CV-01627 JW, pending in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San
Jose Division. In this action, Fujitsu Limited Fujitsu alleges that
semiconductor devices it purchased from Cirrus Logic, Inc. Cirrus Logic are
defective in that a certain epoxy mold compound used in the manufacture of the
chip causes a short circuit which renders Fujitsu disk drive products
inoperable. Cirrus Logic, in response, denied the allegations of the complaint,
counterclaimed against Fujitsu for unpaid invoices, and filed its third-party
complaint against us alleging that any liability for chip defects should be
assigned to us because we assembled the subject semiconductor devices. Upon
receipt of Cirrus Logic third-party complaint, we filed an answer denying all
liability, and our own third-party complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite. Sumitomo
Bakelite filed an answer denying liability. In June 2003, Fujitsu amended its
complaint and added direct claims against us. In response, we filed an answer
denying all liability to Fujitsu. Fujitsu has indicated that it may seek damages
in excess of $100 million. Discovery is ongoing and a trial is currently
scheduled to begin in the Northern District Court of California on January 31,
2005. In November 2003, Fujitsu filed an action against Cirrus Logic, Sumitomo
78 Bakelite and us entitled Fujitsu Limited v. Cirrus Logic, Inc., et al., No.
1-03-CV-009885, in the California Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara,
based on facts and allegations substantially similar to those asserted in the
Northern District Court of California. In December 2003, Cirrus Logic filed a
cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite and us in the Superior Court case,
also based on facts and allegations substantially similar to those asserted in
the Northern District Court case. By stipulation among the parties, Fujitsu and
Cirrus Logic have stated their intent to stay the action pending in the Northern
District Court of California in favor of the action pending in the Santa Clara
Superior Court. Trial in the Superior Court action is currently scheduled to
begin on January 31, 2005. Amkor intends to deny all liability, to file
cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite, and to seek dismissal of all claims
against it in due course.
Seagate Technology LLC v. Atmel Corporation, et al.
In March 2003, we were served with a cross-complaint in an action between
Seagate Technology LLC Seagate and Atmel Corporation Atmel in the
Superior Court of California, Santa Clara County. Atmel cross-complaint seeks
indemnification from us for any damages incurred from the claims by Seagate
involving the allegedly defective epoxy mold compound manufactured by Sumitomo
Bakelite. We have answered Atmel cross-complaint, denying all liability, and
have filed a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite. Atmel later amended its
cross-complaint, including adding ChipPAC Inc. ChipPAC as a cross-defendant.
ChipPAC filed a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite and us. On January 27,
2004, the Superior Court sustained Sumitomo Bakelite motion to dismiss Atmel
cross-complaint, granting Atmel 30 days to file an amended pleading. We filed a
motion to dismiss ChipPAC cross-complaint on February 13, 2004, and otherwise
intend to deny all liability to ChipPAC. We also intend to deny all liability to
Atmel and may seek the dismissal of Atmel further amended cross-complaint upon
receipt, if appropriate. All parties are currently conducting discovery and no
trial date has been set.
Maxtor Corporation v. Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., et al.
In April 2003, we were served with a cross-complaint in an action between
Maxtor Corporation Maxtor and Koninklijke Philips Electronics Philips.
Philips' cross-complaint seeks indemnification from us for any damages incurred
from the claims by Maxtor involving the allegedly defective epoxy mold compound
manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite. Philips subsequently filed a cross-complaint
directly against Sumitomo Bakelite, alleging, among other things, that Sumitomo
Bakelite breached its contractual obligations to both us and Philips by
supplying a defective mold compound resulting in the failure of certain Philips
semiconductor devices. We have denied all liability in this matter and have also
asserted a cross-complaint against Sumitomo Bakelite. Sumitomo Bakelite has
denied any liability. The parties' discovery efforts are ongoing, including
expert discovery. In December 2003, we filed a motion for summary judgment
against Philips cross-claims. The motion shall be heard March 30, 2004. The
trial is scheduled to start on April 12, 2004.
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. v. Amkor Technology, Inc., et al.
In August 2003, we were served with a complaint filed by Maxim Integrated
Products, Inc. Maxim against us, Sumitomo Bakelite and Sumitomo Plastics
America, Inc. Sumitomo Plastics in the Superior Court of California, Santa
Clara County. The complaint seeks damages related to our use of Sumitomo
Bakelite epoxy mold compound in assembling Maxim semiconductor packages.
Both the Sumitomo defendants and we filed motions to dismiss Maxim complaint
in September 2003. In lieu of contesting those motions to dismiss, Maxim has
indicated its intent to file an amended pleading. We intend to deny all
liability to Maxim and to file cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite; we may
file another motion to dismiss Maxim amended complaint upon receipt, if
appropriate. Discovery has not commenced and there is no trial date set.
Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation v. Sumitomo Bakelite Singapore Pte.
Ltd., et al.
In September 2003, we were served with an amended complaint filed by
Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation Fairchild against us, Sumitomo Bakelite,
Sumitomo Plastics and Sumitomo Bakelite Singapore Pte. Ltd. in the Superior
Court of California, Santa Clara County. The amended complaint seeks damages
related to our use of Sumitomo Bakelite epoxy mold compound in assembling
Fairchild semiconductor packages. Both the Sumitomo defendants and we filed
motions to dismiss Fairchild amended complaint in October 2003. Fairchild
filed a second amended complaint in January 2004. On February 11, 2004, we filed
a motion to dismiss Fairchild second amended complaint. We also intend to deny
all liability and to file cross-claims against Sumitomo Bakelite. Discovery is
ongoing and no trial date has been scheduled.
79   OTHER LITIGATION
On August 16, 2002, we filed a complaint against Motorola, Inc. in an
action captioned Amkor Technology, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., C.A. No. 02C-08-160
CHT, pending in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New
Castle County. In this action, we were seeking declaratory judgment relating to
a controversy between us and Motorola concerning: i the assignment by Citizen
Watch Co., Ltd. Citizen to us of a Patent License Agreement dated January
25, 1996 between Motorola and Citizen the License Agreement and concurrent
assignment by Citizen to us of Citizen interest in U.S. Patents 5,241,133 and
5,216,278 the '133 and '278 patents; and ii our obligation to make certain
payments pursuant to an immunity agreement the Immunity Agreement dated June
30, 1993 between us and Motorola.
We and Motorola resolved the controversy with respect to all issues
relating to the Immunity Agreement, and all claims and counterclaims filed by
the parties in the case relating to the Immunity Agreement were dismissed or
otherwise disposed of without further litigation. The claims relating to the
License Agreement and the '133 and '278 Patents remained pending.
We and Motorola both filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining
claims, and oral arguments were heard on September 3, 2003. On October 6, 2003,
the Superior Court of Delaware ruled in favor of us and issued an Opinion and
Order granting our motion for summary judgment and denying Motorola motion for
summary judgment. On October 22, 2003, Motorola filed an appeal in Supreme Court
of Delaware. We believe we will prevail on the same merits in such appeal. In
addition, should Motorola prevail at the appellate level, we believe we have
recourse against Citizen. However, no assurance can be given that an adverse
outcome in the case cannot occur, or that any adverse outcome would not have a
material impact.
Alcatel Business Systems vs. Amkor Technology, Inc., Anam Semiconductor,
Inc.
On November 5, 1999, we agreed to sell certain semiconductor parts to
Alcatel Microelectronics, N.V. AME, a subsidiary of Alcatel S.A. The parts
were manufactured for us by Anam Semiconductor, Inc. ASI. AME transferred
the parts to another Alcatel subsidiary, Alcatel Business Systems ABS, which
incorporated the parts into cellular phone products. In early 2001, a dispute
arose as to whether the parts sold by us were defective. On March 18, 2002, ABS
and its insurer filed suit against us and ASI in the Paris Commercial Court of
France, claiming damages of 50 million Euros approximately $628 million based
on the spot exchange rate at December 31, 2003. We have denied all liability
and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. Additionally, we have entered into a
written agreement with ASI whereby ASI has agreed to indemnify us fully against
any and all loss related to the claims of AME, ABS and ABS' insurer. The Paris
Commercial Court commenced a special proceeding before a technical expert to
report on the facts of the dispute. The report of the court-appointed expert was
put forth on December 31, 2003. The report does not specifically allocate
liability to any particular party. The next proceeding in this matter is
expected in April 2004.
In response to the lawsuit, on May 22, 2002, we filed a petition to compel
arbitration in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania the Court against ABS, AME and ABS' insurer, claiming that the
dispute is subject to the arbitration clause of the November 5, 1999 agreement
between us and AME. ABS and ABS' insurer have refused to arbitrate. In August
2003, the Court denied the motion of ABS and its insurer to dismiss our petition
for arbitration. The Court also subsequently denied a motion for reconsideration
filed by ABS. The Court has not yet set a date for final disposition of our
petition.
22. CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
With the commencement of operations of Amkor Iwate and the acquisition of a
packaging and test facility from Toshiba in 2001, total net revenues derived
from Toshiba accounted for 116%, 147% and 163% of our consolidated net
revenues for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Prior to the sale of our wafer
fabrication services business to ASI in February 2003, we derived 928% and
794% of our wafer fabrication revenues from Texas Instruments TI for 2002 and
2001, respectively. Effective as of February 28, 2003, we obtained a release
from Texas Instruments regarding our contractual obligations with respect to
wafer fabrication services to be performed subsequent to the transfer of the
business to ASI. We restated our historical results to reflect our wafer
fabrication services segment as a discontinued operation see Note 2.
