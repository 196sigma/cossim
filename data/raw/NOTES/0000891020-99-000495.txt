REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Corixa Corporation    We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Corixa Corporation as
of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Corixa Corporation at
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.                                ERNST & YOUNG LLP

CORIXA CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Corixa Corporation is focused on the discovery and early clinical
development of products useful in preventing, treating or diagnosing cancer and
certain infectious diseases as well as immunotherapeutic products for the
treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
All short-term investments, which consist primarily of bankers' acceptances
and certificates of deposit, with maturities of three months or less at date of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. The amounts are recorded at
cost, which approximates fair market value.
SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE
The Company investment portfolio is classified as available-for-sale. The
Company main investment objectives are preservation of principal, a high
degree of liquidity and a maximum total return. The Company invests primarily in
U.S. denominated only: commercial paper; short and mid-term corporate
notes/bonds, with no more than 10% of the portfolio in any one corporate issuer;
and Federal agencies with terms not exceeding four years. Such securities are
stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reflected in
stockholders' equity. Interest earned on securities is included in interest
income. The amortized cost of investments is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and
accretions are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is
calculated using the specific identification method.
MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK
The Company is subject to concentration of credit risk, primarily from its
investments. Credit risk for investments is managed by purchase of investment
grade securities, A1/P1 for money market instruments and A or better for debt
instruments, and diversification of the investment portfolio among issuers and
maturities.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on the
straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives, which range from
three to four years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease. Amortization of assets
recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 and applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25 APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its stock option
plans. Accordingly, Corixa employee stock-based compensation expense is
recognized based on the intrinsic value of the option on the date of grant. Pro
forma disclosure of net loss and net loss per share under Statement 123 is
provided in Note 6.
Stock-based awards granted to non-employees are expensed based on the fair
market value of the award at the date that performance has been completed.
USE OF ESTIMATES
44
46
CORIXA CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
At December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997, the carrying value of financial
instruments such as receivables and payables approximated their fair values,
based on the short-term maturities of these instruments. Additionally, the
carrying value of long-term liabilities approximated fair values because the
underlying interest rates approximate market rates at the balance sheet dates. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
As a result of the merger with GenQuest, all significant inter-company
account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
REVENUE
Revenue under collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable
up-front fees, ongoing research funding, development and technology access
payments, and milestone and royalty payments. Revenue from nonrefundable
up-front fees is recognized upon satisfaction of related obligations. Revenue
from ongoing research and co-development payments is recognized ratably over the
term of the agreement, as the Company believes such payments approximate the
research and development expense being incurred associated with the agreement.
Revenue from milestone, royalty, and other contingent payments will be
recognized as earned. Advance payments received under any agreements in excess
of amounts earned are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue under cost
reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred. The
Company recognized 76%, 74% and 71% of its revenue in fiscal years 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively from two collaborative partners. Grant revenue
represented 7% of the Company revenue during the twelve month period ended
December 31, 1998 and 7% during the same period in 1997.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
Pursuant to SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs,
the Company research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Acquired
In-Process Research and Development is charged to expense.
INCOME TAXES
Corixa accounts for income taxes using the liability method under Statement
of Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
NET LOSS PER SHARE CALCULATION
Basic loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period, and excludes any dilutive effects of options,
warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share assumes the
conversion of all dilutive securities, such as options, warrants and convertible
preferred stock, unless such inclusion is anti-dilutive.
As all preferred stock converted to common stock at the closing of Corixa
initial public offering, the Offering pro forma basic and diluted loss per
share is computed on the basis of the average number of common shares
outstanding plus the effect of preferred shares using the if-converted method.
COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
As of January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general-purpose
financial statements and                     45
47
CORIXA CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
requires reclassification of financial statements for earlier periods to be
provided for comparative purposes. The Company comprehensive loss includes all
items which comprise net loss and the effect of unrealized gains/losses on
available-for-sale securities. Comprehensive income is shown on the statement of
stockholders' equity.
SEGMENT REPORTING
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
the manner in which public companies report information about operating segments
in annual and interim financial statements. The statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The Company does not have any
reporting requirements as defined by SFAS No. 131. RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' financial
statements to conform to the 1998 presentation. 2.  SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATIVE AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS
In October 1998, Corixa entered into a collaboration and license agreement
effective September 1, 1998 with SmithKline Beecham, which superseded and
significantly expanded the scope of Corixa then-existing agreements with SB
Manufacturing and SB Biologicals. SmithKline Beecham has committed to funding of
$436 million for work that is performed in multiple discovery programs over the
next four years. Corixa and SmithKline Beecham may mutually agree to extend the
research and development programs beyond the initial four-year term.
In addition, SmithKline Beecham purchased $25 million worth of Corixa
Common Stock at a premium to its fair market value, and Corixa has the right in
the future to require SmithKline Beecham to purchase an additional $25 million
of Corixa Common Stock, at a premium to its then-current fair market value. The
equity component combined with the discovery program payment results in
aggregate funding of $486 million during the first four years of the agreement.
Additionally, with respect to the $50 million previously paid to Corixa by
SmithKline Beecham under the prior option agreements, which covered the
discovery fields of ovarian and colon cancer, SmithKline Beecham may elect to
have Corixa repay such amount to SmithKline Beecham on September 1, 2003 or
convert such amounts into the purchase of Corixa Common Stock at a premium to
its then-current fair market value.
The Company has various other collaborative research agreements with
academic universities and research institutions, which expire at various
intervals through 2000. Certain agreements stipulate the reimbursement by the
Company of research costs incurred by these universities and institutions on
behalf of the Company. Included in research and development expenses for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 are reimbursements approximating
$23 million, $18 million and $14 million, respectively. Certain 1998
collaborative agreements extend into fiscal years 1999 and 2000, and as of
December 31, 1998 the Company is committed to reimburse these universities and
institutions approximately $12 million and $212,000 in 1999 and 2000,
respectively.
The Company has entered into certain license agreements and obtained
options to negotiate license agreements under the terms of which the Company
received license, technology, and patent rights. During 1998, 1997 and 1996, the
Company paid initial license and/or option fees approximating $18 million 500,000 and $200,000 respectively. The Company issued 22,724, 19,697 and 33,328
shares of common stock during 1998, 1997 and 1996, for such rights. In
conjunction with certain 1996 collaboration agreements, the Company also issued
options to purchase 129,393 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
75,757 and 163,636 shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock,
respectively. See Note 4.
Certain agreements call for royalty and milestone payments to be paid by
the Company. The agreements are for terms from 10 to 17 years or the expiration
of the last issued patent within the licensed technology, unless terminated
earlier for certain specified events, as defined in the respective agreements.
Additionally, the Company has entered into research and license agreements
and granted options to other parties to negotiate license agreements under the
terms of which the Company provides license, technology, and patent rights.
Under the terms of the                     46

CORIXA CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
agreements, the Company will receive additional license fees, option fees and/or
reimbursement of certain research and development costs through 1998. The
agreements provide for one-time payments upon the achievement of certain
milestones and the payment of royalties based on product sales.
3.  ACQUISITION OF GENQUEST
On September 15, 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares
of common stock of GenQuest. GenQuest was a development stage biotechnology
company focused on applying functional genomics technology to discover novel
genes and to develop the potential of such genes and related gene products to be
used as diagnostics, therapeutics, and drug screening targets in the field of
oncology. Prior to the acquisition, Corixa was a stockholder in GenQuest.
Aggregate consideration for the acquisition was approximately $124
million, which consisted of 1,063,695 shares of Corixa common stock, with a
market value of approximately $73 million, approximately $45 million in cash,
and approximately $600,000 of acquisition costs. The aggregate purchase price
exceeded the fair value of tangible assets by approximately $120 million, and
this amount was allocated to in-process research and development during the
third quarter of 1998. The aggregate purchase price was allocated, based on
estimated fair values on the acquisition date, as follows in thousands                  
In-process research and
development     $ 12,021
Net assets acquired        421
Total purchase price     $ 12,442
In February 1996, Corixa entered into a license and research collaboration
agreement with GenQuest for the purpose of discovering, characterizing,
developing, and commercializing novel genes for use in the treatment,
prevention, or diagnosis of cancer. In connection with the agreement, Corixa
acquired an aggregate of 4,412,613 shares of Series A preferred stock of
GenQuest in exchange for the transfer of certain intellectual property rights.
The Series A preferred shares represented approximately 16% of GenQuest
outstanding capital stock at December 31, 1997.
In conjunction with the relationship between Corixa and GenQuest, Corixa
issued warrants to purchase 454,533 shares of Corixa Series B shares at a
price of $990 per share. The warrants expire on the earlier of December 23,
2001 or certain events as specified in the warrant agreements. A receivable of
$652,000 from GenQuest, which represents the outstanding amount due for the
warrants was established at the time of issuance. The remaining receivable was
expensed in connection with the acquisition of GenQuest see below.
For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, Corixa recognized
other income of approximately $204,000, $325,000 and $300,000, respectively, as
a result of administrative services provided to GenQuest.
In conjunction with its collaborative agreement with GenQuest, Corixa
December 31, 1998 and 1997 results include collaborative revenue and research
and development expenses of approximately $10 million and $17 million and $19
million and $24 million, respectively. Additionally, Corixa recognized $652,000
and $488,000 in warrant amortization during the year ended December 31, 1998 and
1997, respectively. Corixa did not recognize collaborative revenue or research
and development expenses relating to GenQuest in 1996.
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

In connection with the Offering, Corixa Series A Preferred Stock and
Series B Preferred Stock were converted, after obtaining the consent of a

Corixa has a stock option plan, the Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Option
Plan the 1994 Plan under which an aggregate of 2,364,208 shares of common
stock were reserved for grants to employees, members of the Board of Directors,
and consultants as of December 31, 1998. Options granted under the 1994 Plan may
be designated as incentive or nonqualified at the discretion of the Plan
Administrator as defined in the 1994 Plan. On July 25, 1997, Corixa amended
and restated the 1994 Plan, whereby the number of shares authorized under the
1994 Plan was increased by 700,000 shares and is subject to automatic increase
on the first trading day of each of the ten calendar years beginning in 1998 and
ending in 2007, in an amount equal to 3% of the number of shares of common stock
outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, up to a
maximum of 500,000 shares each year over the ten-year period.
Generally, the options become exercisable over a four-year period with 25%
vesting upon the first year and the remainder vesting monthly thereafter. All
options expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. Incentive stock
options are exercisable at not less than the fair market value of the stock at
the date of grant, and nonqualified stock options are exercisable at prices
determined at the discretion of the Plan Administrator, but not less than 85% of
the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The Administrator has
the discretion to grant options that are exercisable for unvested shares of
Corixa Common Stock and, to the extent that an optionee holds options for such
unvested shares of Corixa Common Stock upon termination, Corixa has the right to
repurchase any or all of the unvested shares at the per-share exercise price

STOCK WARRANTS
During 1996, Corixa issued warrants to purchase 114,342 shares of common
stock at exercise prices ranging from $0003 to $660 per share and 163,636
shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $660 per share.
These warrants were issued in connection with certain collaborative agreements
and the leasing of office and research facilities. Vesting of the warrants to
purchase 75,757 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 163,636 shares
of Series A stock is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones. The
weighted average grant-date fair value ranges from $099 to negligible per
share, and negligible per share for common stock and Series A shares,
respectively. Additional warrants to purchase 454,533 shares of Series B stock
were issued in 1996. See Note 9 of these Corixa financial statements.
In connection with the Offering, all Series A and Series B share warrants
were converted to warrants to purchase common shares on a share-for-share basis.
445,139 shares of common stock were issued upon the net exercise of 483,008
stock warrants during 1997. The number of common shares purchased reflects the
difference between the aggregate exercise price of the warrants and the market
price per share of the common stock of the aggregate number of shares
purchasable under the warrant.
Corixa recognizes research and development expense for the calculated fair
value of milestone specific warrants, for which milestone achievement has been
deemed probable by management. No warrant-related milestones were reached during
1998 or in 1997. Final valuation of the warrant costs is calculated at the
actual achievement of these milestones based on the fair value of the underlying
stock at that date.
Corixa had common stock warrants outstanding for 684,893 shares as of
December 31, 1998 at a weighted average exercise price of $804 which will
expire between 2001 and 2008.

NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic and diluted loss per share are calculated using the average number of
common shares outstanding see Note 1. Pro forma basic and diluted loss per
share are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares
outstanding plus the effect of convertible preferred shares using the
if-converted method as follows                           YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

7.  INCOME TAXES
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $290 million and $99 million, respectively, and
research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $19 million
and $836,000, respectively, which begin to expire in 2009. Utilization of net
operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards is
subject to change of certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code. During the period 1995 through 1998, the Company experienced
ownership changes as defined by the Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Company use
of losses incurred through the date of any ownership changes will be limited on
an annual basis during the carryforward period.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company has
recognized a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets due to the
uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the assets. The valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets increased $64 million and $11 million during 1998 and
1997, respectively. The effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that
give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows                            DECEMBER 31,

8.  401K PLAN
Corixa has a tax-qualified employee savings and retirement plan the
401k Plan covering all of Corixa employees. Pursuant to the 401k Plan,
employees may elect to reduce their current compensation by up to the
statutorily prescribed annual limit $10,000 in 1998 and to have the amount of
such reduction contributed to the 401k Plan. Corixa did not match
contributions before 1998. Effective January 1, 1998, Corixa implemented a
401k matching program whereby Corixa contributes twenty-five cents for each
dollar a participant contributes, with a maximum contribution of 25% of the
first 8% of a participant earnings not to exceed 25% of the prescribed annual
limit. The 401k Plan is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal
Revenue Code so that contributions by employees or by Corixa to the 401k Plan,
and income earned on 401k Plan contributions, are not taxable to employees
until withdrawn from the 401k Plan, and so that contributions by Corixa, if
any, will be deductible by Corixa when made. At the direction of each
participant, Corixa invests the assets of the 401k Plan in any of five
investment options. Company contributions under the plan were approximately
$98,000 in 1998.

ImmGenics
On November 4th, 1998 Corixa and ImmGenics Pharmaceuticals Inc.
ImmGenics, a privately held biotechnology company signed an exclusive
agreement to utilize ImmGenics' proprietary Selected Lymphocyte Antibody Method
technology to develop high-potency therapeutic and diagnostic monoclonal
antibodies targeting Corixa proprietary antigens in cancer and infectious
disease. This agreement marks Corixa first venture into the development of
antibodyproducts. Under the terms of the agreement, ImmGenics could receive
research, development and milestone payments, as well as royalty streams on
future product sales. In addition to the collaborative agreement, Corixa
purchased an aggregate 859,000 shares of Class A Preferred stock for $125
million and also entered into a $500,000 non-interest bearing convertible
debenture and will be required to invest an additional $125 million in 1999, if
certain scientific milestones are achieved, for a total investment by Corixa of
$30 million. Additionally, the Company received warrants to acquire ImmGenics
Class A Preferred stock. The number of warrants increases if ImmGenics does not
obtain specified financing milestones.
Anergen
In December 1998 the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
Anergen, Inc. Anergen, a development stage biotechnology company focused on
the treatment of autoimmune diseases through the discovery and development of
proprietary therapeutics that selectively interrupt the disease process. The
acquisition of Anergen was dependent on Anergen shareholder approval. That
approval occurred on February 10, 1999. The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase valued at approximately $81 million. The balance will be paid in
approximately 11 million shares of Corixa common stock. Through December 31,
1998, Corixa has incurred approximately $800,000 in pre-acquisition costs
associated with the transaction. A substantial portion of the purchase price
