REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Align-Rite International, Inc.
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of Align-Rite International, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company listed in the index on page 14 of this Form 10-K. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as
of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1998,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information required to be included therein.

ALIGN-RITE INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION:
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Align-Rite
International, Inc. ARII, a California corporation, incorporated on April
27, 1995, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Align-Rite International Limited
ARI, Align-Rite Corporation ARC, and Align-Rite Limited ARL,
Align-Rite B.V. ARBV and Align-Rite GmbH ARGmbH. ARII and its
subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
The principal activity of ARII, ARI and ARBV is that of holding companies
into which their respective subsidiaries are consolidated. On July 21, 1995 ARII
completed an initial public offering of Common Stock, as part of which all of
the outstanding Ordinary Shares of ARI were exchanged for the Common Stock of
ARII. The Company manufactures quality photomasks in the United States and
Europe. Effective June 1, 1997, the Company newly formed subsidiary, ARGmbH,
completed its first business acquisition. The Company purchased the photomask
business unit of Temic Telefunken Microelectronic GmbH Temic, a division of
Daimler-Benz, located in Heilbronn, and Germany. The acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition was not material to
the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
Photomasks are required for the manufacture of virtually all integrated
circuits, which are essential components in consumer and industrial electronic
products. Photomasks are precision photographic quartz or glass plates
containing microscopic images of integrated circuits. The Company images
integrated circuit patterns onto photomasks using electron beam, laser beam and
optical microlithography methods at its manufacturing facilities in Burbank,
California and Bridgend, Wales.
The Company maintains a policy and practice of restricting ARC from paying
dividends or making certain other distributions in order to minimize tax
consequences resulting from its current corporate structure.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of raw materials and are valued at the lower
of cost or market. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. On a
monthly basis, the Company reduces inventory for individual items identified as
obsolete, stale, slow moving or non-salable.
The Company purchases a majority of its raw materials from a foreign
supplier. The Company does not hedge foreign currency risks.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon
the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from
20
23
ALIGN-RITE INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
three to ten years. Useful lives are evaluated regularly by management in order
to determine recoverability in light of current technological conditions.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease
or the improvement. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred
while renewals and improvements are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of
property and equipment, the accounts are relieved of the cost and the related
accumulated depreciation or amortization with any resulting gain or loss
included in the Statement of Operations.
Intangible Assets
Cash paid in excess of fair value of acquired company and certain costs
related to the acquisition represent the value of intangible assets. Intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 years. The Company
periodically reviews intangibles to assess recoverability. Impairment is
recognized in operating results, if deemed permanent.
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes.
Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on
the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established, when
necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when the title to goods passes to the
customer, generally upon shipment. The Company provides an accrual for estimated
volume discounts for certain customers at the time of shipment and adjusts this
accrual as needed based upon actual results.
Net Income Per Common Share
Net Income per common share basic EPS is computed by dividing net
income available to common shareholders the numerator by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period. The
computation of net income per common share -- assuming dilution diluted EPS
is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been
outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25
APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and complies with the
disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB No. 25, compensation cost, if any, is recognized over
the respective vesting period based on the difference, on the date of grant,
between the fair value of the Company Common Stock and the grant price.
Foreign Currency Translations
The functional currency of ARI and ARL is the Pound Sterling. The
accompanying financial statements include transactions and balances for these
entities translated into U.S. dollar amounts in conformity with SFAS No. 52.
This Statement requires the translation of assets and liabilities at the
exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date and income and expense
accounts at the weighted average rate in effect during the
21
24
ALIGN-RITE INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
fiscal year. The aggregate effect of translating the financial statements of ARI
and ARL is included as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The Company
has included in operating income all foreign exchange transaction gains and
losses arising from foreign currency transactions.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year classifications.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Financial Accounting Standard No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS
130. SFAS 130, which requires companies to adopt its provisions for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997, establishes standards for the reporting
and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of general
purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the change in
equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other
events and circumstances from nonowner sources. Management does not believe the
adoption of SFAS 130 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial
statements.
In June 1997, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard SFAS 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
131. This statement requires companies to adopt its provisions for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997, requires publicly-held companies to
report financial and other information about key revenue-producing segments of
the Company for which such information is available and is utilized by the chief
operating decision maker. Specific information to be reported for individual
segments includes profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items and total
assets. A reconciliation of segment financial information to amounts reported in
the financial statements would be provided. Management is currently evaluating
the requirements of adopting SFAS 131 and the effects, if any, on the Company

provides that ARC will, at its discretion, make contributions to the Plan on a
periodic basis. Additionally, the employer will match 25% of the first 6% of the
employees contribution, which amounts vest over five years. Terminations and
forfeitures from the Plan are used to reduce the employer contribution. ARC
made contributions to the Plan of $68,380, $48,241 and $45,115 in 1998, 1997,

The fair value of options granted during 1998 and 1997 is estimated
$323,067 and $195,966, respectively, on the dates of grants using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: i divided
yield of 0%, ii expected volatility of 61% and 40% for 1998 and 1997
respectively, iii weighted average risk-free interest rates ranging from 61%
to 66% and 65% for 1998 and 1997 respectively, iv weighted average expected
life of 50 years for 1998 and 1997, and v assumed forfeiture rate of 1% for
1998 and 1997.
The Company applies APB No. 25 in accounting for its stock options granted
to employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the
Company stock-based compensation plans. Had compensation costs for the
Company stock option and purchase plans been determined based upon the
methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings
per share would approximate the pro forma amounts below:

The effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not
indicative of future amounts. SFAS No. 123 does not apply to awards prior to
1995, and additional awards in future years are anticipated.
Options granted in connection with the 1987 Plan and 1995 Plan were at
exercise prices denominated in British pounds and U.S. dollars, respectively.
The price per share for options issued prior to April 1, 1995, in terms of U.S.
dollars, using the March 31, 1997 exchange rate, ranged from $82 to $282.
On July 25, 1995, the Company granted 111,396 options at an exercise price
of $332 per share to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer which vest at a
rate of 10% per year except the last installment which vests 60 days prior to
the tenth anniversary of the grant. Additionally any unvested options will
automatically vest in the event of death, disability, termination without cause,
or if a change-in-control occurs. The difference between the option price and
the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of grant of $1,106,160
will be charged to operations at a rate of 10% per year.
The Company has reserved 636,661 shares of Common Stock for issuance upon
the exercise of options.
14. MINORITY INTERESTS:
On March 24, 1992, ARL issued 800,000 Redeemable Preferred Shares the
Preferred Shares with a nominal value of L1 each $173 at March 24, 1992 in

15. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts
