FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Force Protection, Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Force Protection, Inc. and
subsidiary as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we
engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Force Protection Inc., and subsidiary as of
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Force Protection Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 2, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Jaspers + Hall, PC

March 2, 2007 21 REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Force Protection, Inc.
We have audited managements
assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, that Force Protection Inc. and subsidiary
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
the COSO criteria. Force Protection Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, managements
assessment that Force Protection Inc. and subsidiary maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Force Protection Inc. and subsidiary maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Force
Protection Inc. and subsidiary as of December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006,
and our report dated March 2, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Jaspers + Hall, PC

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
These notes are an integral part
of the Companys financial statements set forth above.
NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Restated
2005 and 2004 Restatement
Restatement of Accounting for
Preferred Stock and Warrants Issued to Investors
Force Protection, Inc.
the Company will be filing an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2005 to amend and restate financial statements
and other information for the years 2005 and 2004. The restatement adjusts the Companys
accounting for preferred stock and warrants issued to investors, accounting for
stock-based compensation to employees and non-employees and accounting for rent
expense on a straight-line basis. The financial information included in this
10-K referring to prior years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 includes each
accounting restatement. Given that the
company is still in the process of finalizing the restatement with the SEC,
there is the potential the restated numbers may change pending final resolution. The Company believes that
the restatement did not have any material impact its 2006 financial results.
The items
identified by the Company relate to the valuation method used to account for
certain equity issuances which did not properly include a full analysis of the
embedded conversion feature associated with such issuances as required under
EITF 98-5, Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion
Features or Contingently adjustable Conversion Ratios, or which were otherwise
incorrectly valued. As a result, a number of shares of the Companys stock
issued as compensation to certain executives and other third parties and
recorded as general and administrative compensation expense appear to have been
valued at less than fair value.
The Company has
reviewed its accounting for Preferred Stock and Warrants Issued to Investors as
follows Series B and
Series C Convertible Preferred Stock are recorded as equity at fair value using
the Black Scholes Method at the time of issuance using a one year holding
period.
A Beneficial
Conversion Feature treated as equity is created when the value received for
each issuance is less than the fair value from the Black Scholes
calculation. Changes in conversion rates
of Preferred Stock into Common Stock also can create a Beneficial Conversion
Feature if the Preferred Stock can be converted into more common shares than at
issuance or last amendment.
Series D Mandatory
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is recorded at fair value equaling the
net cash proceeds from issuance minus the fair value of Warrants issued in
conjunction with the Series D Preferred Stock.
Dividends for Series D Preferred Stock were distributed either as Common
Stock shares or in cash.
The Warrants
issued in conjunction with the Series D Preferred Stock were initially recorded
at fair value as a liability as liquidating damages were paid as a result of a
late SEC registration of the underlying Common Stock. The Black-Scholes Method was used to
determine the fair value at issuance using a three year holding period. These Warrants are adjusted each reporting
period to the new fair value using the Black Scholes Method until the
registration was accepted by the SEC. At
that point, the fair value using the Black Scholes Method was reclassified into
Equity. A realized gain on derivative
liability in the amount of $2,830,791 was recorded in 2005 as a result of the
change in fair value from issuance to reclassification to equity for these
Warrants.
Other warrants
are recorded at fair value using the Black Scholes Method. 27 Restatement of Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
for Services and Compensation.
The Company has
reviewed its accounting for stock based compensation issued for services and
compensation during 2005, 2004 and 2003 taking into account, were applicable,
Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 123. Stock based compensation issued for services and compensation
were valued at the market price at the time of issuance. As a result of revaluation, a reduction in
expense of $222,737 was recorded in 2005 and additional expense of $1,626,663
and $2,946,137 was recorded in 2004 and 2003.
The Company has
reviewed the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 123Revised SFAS 123R and has determined that
the Company will adopt SFAS 123R as of July1, 2005 Stock option expense of
$92,671 was recorded for 2005.
Restatement of Accounting for Operating Lease
Commitments
The Company has
reviewed the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 13 and has determined that in 2005, 2004 and 2003 the
Companys accounting for rent expense was not recorded on a straight-line basis
over the term of the Companys operating lease commitments. Several of the Companys operating leases in
effect during 2005, 2004 and 2003 included certain terms which provided for several
months at the beginning of the lease term whereby rents were not due. Additionally, rent escalation clauses were
included within certain operating leases which previous to this filing had
improperly deferred rent expense over the course of the leases. The Company has calculated the necessary
adjustments for 2005, 2004 and 2003 in order to restate its financial
statements and record rent expense associated with operating lease commitments
for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Additional rent
expense for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was recorded in the amount of $12,039, $79,985
and $44,588, respectively.
In light of the
restatement, readers should not rely on previously filed financial statements
and other financial information for the years and for each of the quarters in
the years 2005, 2004 and 2003. 28 Effects of

General
Statement
The
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has issued Financial Reporting
Release No60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical
Accounting Policies, or FRR 60, suggesting companies provide additional
disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In FRR
60, the SEC defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are
most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and  29 operating
results, and require management to make its most difficult and subjective
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are
inherently uncertain. The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in
applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on
the results the Company reports in its financial statements.
The Company believes the
following critical accounting policies and procedures, among others, affect its
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Companys
consolidated financial statements Revenue
recognition Inventory
costand Associated Reserves; and
Allocation of
directand indirect cost of sales.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Companys revenue is derived principally from the sale of its vehicles and
associated spare parts and training services. Revenue from product sales and
spare part sales, net of an allowance for contractual adjustments, is
recognized when the products or spare parts are delivered to and formally
accepted by the customer. The Company defines formal acceptance as taking
place when a representative of the United States government signs the United
States Form DD250 entitled Material Inspection and Receiving Report which
under the Federal Acquisition Regulations signifies contractual inspection and
acceptance of the work performed by the contractor. It also acts as the contractual invoice
creating payment liability on the United States Government. In accordance with standard industry
practice, there is a representative from the United States Defense Contractor
Manufacturing Agency DCMA acting as a contractual representative of the
United States Government present at the Companys facilities. This DCMA representative inspects each
vehicle as it is delivered by the Company and upon confirmation of the vehicles
conformity with the contractual specifications the inspector signs the Form
DD250 and formally accepts delivery of the vehicle. The Company only recognizes revenues arising
from its U.S. Government contracts upon execution of the Form DD250 by the DCMA
inspector. Under some of the Companys U.S. Government contracts, it receives
performance based payments based on completion of specific milestones
stipulated under the contract for example, delivery of raw material to the
Companys Ladson facility. These payments are recorded as deferred revenue
and carried on the Companys balance sheet until the final delivery of the
products and formal acceptance by the U.S. Government pursuant to the Form
DD250. Upon acceptance of the products and the execution of the Form DD250, the
Company recognizes the full sale price of the product as revenue.
Revenues
from services provided are recorded in accordance with specific contractual
terms. Services have historically
consisted of the Company providing on-site personnel on an as-needed basis in a
timely manner, and have generally been provided in foreign locations.
The
Company negotiates contracts with its customers which may include revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables, as outlined by Emerging Issues Task
Force No. 00-21 EITF 00-21. The
Companys accounting policies are defined such that each deliverable under a
contract is accounted for separately.
Historically, the Company has negotiated and signed contracts with its
customers which outline the contract amount and specific terms and conditions
associated with each deliverable.
Allowance for
Contractual Adjustments
The
Companys contracts with the U.S. Government are negotiated as a sole source
or open competition bid process. A
sole source process is one in which the Company is the sole bidder for the
contract. An open competition could
involve various bidders. Once a bid is
accepted, the U.S. Government expects work to commence immediately. An open competition results in a final
agreed-upon contract price which the U.S. Government has agreed to. A sole source process results in an agreed-upon
contract with the U.S. Government, subject to an adjustment process at a later
date, termed the definitization process.
The definitization process commences upon delivery of a product, whereby
the U.S. Government completes a detailed review of the Companys costs involved
in the manufacturing and delivery process.
The U.S. Government and the Company then work to determine an adequate
and fair final contract price. As a
result of the potential adjustments related to the definitization process, the
Company maintains an allowance for contractual adjustments account. This account is reviewed on a monthly basis
to determine adequate adjustments, if necessary. The allowance is maintained and deemed
adequate based on the analysis of historical data  30 and
calculation of pro-rata percentages of current contracts in place, which remain
subject to the definitization process.
Historically,
the Company has not encountered sales returns.
The Company does not anticipate sales returns in the future.
Research and
Development
Research,
development, and engineering costs are expensed as incurred, in accordance with
SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs.
Research, development, and engineering expenses primarily include payroll and
headcount related costs, contractor fees, infrastructure costs, and
administrative expenses directly related to research and development support.
Cash
Equivalents
For
purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Inventories
Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost is determined under the
first-in-first-out FIFO method
valuation method. An allowance for
excess or obsolete inventory is maintained by the Company. The
Company determines an appropriate balance in this account based on historical
data and specific identification of certain inventory items.
Property,
Plant and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost or at the
value of the operating agreement. The Company capitalizes additions and
improvements which include all material, labor and engineering cost to design,
install or improve the asset. Routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives 
Leasehold Improvements
2-5 years
Furniture and
fixtures
3 years
Machinery and
equipment
7 years
Tooling and
molds
7 years
Vehicles
5 years
Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets
The
Company reviews long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of
the asset, the Company would recognize an impairment loss based on the
estimated fair value of the asset.
Goodwill
Under SFAS No142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, all goodwill amortization ceased effective
January1, 2002. Rather, goodwill is now subject to only impairment
reviews. A fair-value based test is applied at the reporting level. This test
requires various judgments and estimates. A goodwill impairment loss will be
recorded for any goodwill that is determined to be impaired. Goodwill is tested
for impairment at least annually.
Foreign
Currency Transaction
Assets
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date, and the resulting gains
and losses are reflected in the statements of operations. Gains and losses
arising from translation of a subsidiarys  31 foreign
currency financial statements are shown as a component of stockholders equity
deficit as accumulated comprehensive income loss.
Income
Taxes
The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. The
asset and liability method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying
enacted statutory rates in effect for periods in which the difference between
the book value and the tax bases of assets and liabilities are scheduled to
reverse. The resulting deferred tax asset or liability is adjusted to reflect
changes in tax laws or rates. The company records a valuation allowance for any
deferred tax allowance that it believes will not be realized.
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company applied the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
, and related Interpretations in accounting for those plans through June 30,
2005.
In
December2004, FASB issued Statement No123R, Share-Based Payment, which establishes
accounting standards for transactions in which an entity receives employee
services in exchange for aequity instruments of the entity or
bliabilities that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of equity instruments.
Effective on July 1, 2005, SFAS 123Rthe Company adopted SFAS 123R,
which requires the Company to recognize the grant-date fair value of stock
options and equity based compensation issued to employees in the statement of
operations. The statement also requires that such transactions be accounted for
using the fair-value-based method, thereby eliminating use of the intrinsic
method of accounting in APB No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, which was permitted under Statement
123, as originally issued.
Earnings Loss per Common Share
The Company utilizes SFAS
No. 128, Earnings per Share to calculate earnings/loss per share. Basic
earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing the earnings/loss available to
common stockholders as the numerator by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding as the denominator. Diluted earnings/loss per share is
computed similar to basic earnings/loss per share except that the denominator
is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have
been outstanding if all potential common stock including common stock
equivalents had all been issued, and if such additional common shares were
dilutive. Under SFAS No. 128, if the additional common shares are dilutive,
they are not added to the denominator in the calculation. Where there is a
loss, the inclusion of additional common shares is anti-dilutive since the
increased number of shares reduces the per share loss available to common stock
holders.
Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates
and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are
reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are
determined to be necessary.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications
to the Companys income statement have been made in 2006, 2005, and 2004 in order
for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 financial statements to conform to the presentation
of these financial statements. These
reclassifications are the restatement of the Research and Development expenses
from General and Administrative expenses. 32 Recent Accounting
Pronouncements
In June 2006, the FASB
issued FIN No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.
This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial
statement recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of uncertain
tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN No. 48 is effective for Force Protection
in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The
Company is currently assessing the impact that FIN No. 48 will have on the
results of its operations, financial position, or cash flows.
In June 2005, the
Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, reached a consensus on Issue05-6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements,
which requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination
or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the
lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that
are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase.
EITF05-6 is effective for periods beginning after July1, 2005. The
Company does not expect the provisions of this consensus to have a material
impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In May 2005, the FASB
issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections SFAS154
which replaces Accounting Principles Board Opinions No20 Accounting
Changes and SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim
Financial StatementsAn Amendment of APB Opinion No28. SFAS154
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and
error corrections. It establishes retrospective application, or the latest
practicable date, as the required method for reporting a change in accounting
principle and the reporting of a correction of an error. SFAS154 is
effective for accounting changes and a correction of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by
the Company in the first quarter of 2006. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect that the adoption of SFAS154 will have on its results of
operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material
impact.
In March 2005, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations FIN47. FIN47 provides guidance relating
to the identification of and financial reporting for legal obligations to
perform an asset retirement activity. The Interpretation requires recognition
of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation
when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated.
FIN47 also defines when an entity would have sufficient information to
reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. The
provision is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after
December15, 2005. The Company will adopt FIN47 beginning the first
quarter of fiscal year 2006 and does not believe the adoption will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations
or cash flows.
NOTE 2 CONCENTRATIONS
The Companys future
operations and continued expansion is subject to a significant concentration
risk. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Companys revenues from military units of the U.S. Government accounted for
84%, 90% and 97% of total revenues,
respectively. The Companys accounts receivable from military units of
the U.S. Government at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to 81%, 60%
and 95% of total accounts receivable, respectively.
NOTE 3 
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES DEFINITIZATION
The majority of the
Companys contracts are with the United States Government and as such they are public
sector contracts subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations set out at
Title 41 of the United States Code or FAR, and may result either from
competitive bidding or may be awarded as sole source contracts subject to
definitization as provided under FAR Section 252217-7027.
Following the award of a
sole source contract, a central component of the definitization process is the
negotiation and finalization of the contract price between the contractor and
the United States contracting officer.
As part of this process, the parties make a mutual determination of the
direct material and labor costs for the work based upon the bill of materials
and other purchasing information and then the parties mutually agree upon rates
for the indirect labor costs and the General and Administrative costs and
upon a fee or profit. While the direct material costs and labor can
be established through objective evidence, the rates and fee are more
subjective and are based upon  33 an analysis of multiple
factors including historical performance data and projected operational
factors. The contractor has the right to
submit proposed rates and fee, but these are subject to final review and
approval by the contracting officer, who may insist on using alternate rates
and fee. As provided in section
252217-7027c If
agreement on a definitive contract action to supersede this undefinitized
contract action is not reached by the target date in paragraph b of this
clause, or within any extension of it granted by the Contracting Officer, the
Contracting Officer may, with the approval of the head of the contracting
activity, determine a reasonable price or fee in accordance with subpart 154
and part 31 of the FAR, subject to Contractor appeal as provided in the Disputes
clause.
Finally, although both
parties make an effort to definitize the contract as quickly as possible, the
process is time consuming and can take months or even years to complete. During the definitization process the contractor
is required to perform the contract work and to make deliveries under the
contract before the final contract price has been established. For this reason, as part of the original
letter award, the contractor provides a rough order of magnitude or ROM,
price to be used for invoicing and accounting purposes pending definitization.
As a result of the
potential adjustments related to the definitization process, the Company
maintains an allowance for contractual adjustments account. This account is reviewed on a regular basis
to determine adequate adjustments, if necessary. The allowance is evaluated and deemed
adequate based on the analysis of historical data and calculation of pro-rata
percentages of current contracts in place, which remain subject to the
definitization process.
Below is a table
detailing activity within the allowance for contractual adjustments account for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively.

The Company does not
maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts.
The Companys significant sales for the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 involved contracts signed with the U.S. Government. As of the
date of this report all non-direct government year-end receivables have been
collected. The Company does not believe an allowance for doubtful accounts is
necessary due to the credit-worthiness of the U.S. Government.
Historically, the Company
has not encountered sales returns. The
Company does not anticipate sales returns in the future.
NOTE 4 
INVESTMENT IN CHALLENGER POWERBOATS INC.
On June 1, 2003, and
modified on September 15, 2003, the Company sold the asset associated with its
boat business to Rockwell Power Systems, Inc., which subsequently merged with
Xtreme Companies, Inc, now called Challenger Powerboats, Inc., a public company
traded on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board. As consideration for the sale,
the Company received 1/3 of Challenger Powerboats outstanding common stock,
which was distributed directly to the Companys common stock
shareholders. Additionally, the Company was to receive 500 shares of
Challenger Powerboats Series A preferred stock. The Company has been in
communications with Challenger Powerboats but has yet to receive these
shares. The Company has elected to account for the investment in
Challenger Powerboats Series A preferred stock under the cost method and has
provided for a full valuation allowance against the fair market value of these
shares as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 34

The
Company is party to a Memorandum of Understanding with Mechem, a division of
Denel PTY, a South African company pursuant to which Mechem agreed for a period
of five years to work exclusively with the Company and not to cede, dispose or
transfer to any third party other than the Company any of its technology, IPR
or other proprietary information relating to its armored vehicles systems
including, but not limited to, designs, drawings, full technical specifications,
test data, hardware and software designs and technologies, suppliers list,
know-how and all and every piece of information and data relevant to such
systems. In exchange for such exclusivity the Company agreed to pay Mechem a vehicle
fee, for every Buffalo, Cougar and Tempest the Company manufactures and sells.
The Company is not obligated to pay a vehicle fee in respect of other vehicles
it manufactures and sells. On September 13, 2006 the Company executed a new
Memorandum of Agreement with Mechem, extending the period of exclusivity for an
additional five years, and adding a provision that Mechem would upon request by

OPTIONS AND STOCK GRANTS
Stock Options
The Company does not have
a formal stock option plan. However, the Company has offered its employees
stock options. During 2006 and 2005, the Company issued options to purchase
1,508,125 and 652,833 shares of its unregistered common stock, respectively, to
certain employees
The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R SFAS 123R as of
July 1, 2005. SFAS 123R provides for
mandatory expensing of the estimated value of stock options granted to the
Companys employees over the period of time the stock options vest. The Company measures the total cost of each
stock option grant at the date of grant using the Black Schole option trading
model. We recognize the cost of each
stock option on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period.
All stock options issued
in 2005 do not carry a designated expiration date and vest over a 1 year
period.
Stock option expense
recorded for 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $701,124, $92,671 and $0,
respectively.
The Company adopted SFAS 123R as of July 1, 2005. Had the Company adopted SFAS 123R as of
January 1, 2005, the pro forma impact on the 2005 net loss would have been an
increase in the net loss reported by the Company of $39,128.

NOTE 13SERIES D WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK
Warrants to purchase 2,633,333 shares of common stock
were issued to the purchasers of the Series D Preferred Stock and were valued
at $8,004,200 and recorded initially as a Warrant Liability on January 19,
2005. While EITF 00-19 outlines various
instances for determining appropriate accounting treatment of the warrants,
these warrants contained registration rights where significant cash liquidated
damages could be required to be paid to the holder of the instrument if the
issuer fails to register shares timely.
The potential penalty equal to 15% of the aggregate purchase price is
considered substantial based on the financial condition and operating cash
flows of the Company. During 2005,
approximately $237,000 was paid in liquidated damages related to the Companys
failure to register shares in a timely manner. The Warrant Liability was valued
on January 19, 2005 using Black-Scholes with the following inputs 49 Number

Term

Discount
rate 342%, representing the three* year Treasury at the date of issuance
Volatility
259%, based on the stock prices during three* years prior to issuance
*coincides with the term of the Warrants
In accordance with EITF 00-19, the Warrants issued in
conjunction with the Series D Preferred Stock were initially recorded at fair
value as a liability as liquidating damages were paid as a result of a late SEC
registration of the underlying Common Stock.
The Black Scholes Method was used to determine the fair value at
issuance using a three year holding period.
These Warrants are adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value
using the Black-Scholes Method until the registration was accepted by the
SEC. At that point, the fair value using
the Black-Scholes Method was reclassified into Equity. A realized gain on derivative liability in
the amount of $2,830,791 was recorded in 2005 as a result of the change in fair
value from issuance to reclassification to equity for these Warrants.
The Warrant Liability was
valued for reclassification on May 11, 2005 using Black-Scholes with the
following inputs 1. Number of Warrant
shares 2,633,333
2. Stock price at
reporting date $208 per share
3. Exercise price 
$375 per share
4. Term 27 years

of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable
to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.

removed the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets since it expects to
realize future earning to be offset by future tax benefits. In 2005 and 2004
the company recorded a valuation allowance for all of its  51 net deferred tax
assets. The Companys valuation
allowance decreased for the year ended December 31, 2006, $14,186,137 and increased for the years ended
December 31, 2005, and 2004 $5,933,763 and $3,713,302 respectively.

NOTE 18 EARNINGS/LOSS PER SHARE
The
Company utilizes SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share to calculate gain/loss per
share. Basic earnings/loss per share is computed by dividing the earnings/loss
available to common stockholders as the numerator by the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding as the denominator. Diluted earnings/loss
per share is computed similar to basic earning/loss per share except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if all potential common stock including common
stock equivalents had all been issued, and if such additional common shares
were dilutive.
