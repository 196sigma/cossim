REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Physician Sales & Service, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Physician
Sales & Service, Inc. a Florida corporation and subsidiaries as of March 28,
1997 and March 29, 1996, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 28, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Physician Sales & Service,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended March 28, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in Item 8, Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data, is presented for purposes of complying with
the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, based on our audits, fairly states in all material respects the
financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
THE COMPANY AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
Physician Sales & Service, Inc. the Company or PSS was incorporated
in 1983 in Jacksonville, Florida. The Company, in its core business, is a
leading distributor of medical supplies, equipment, and pharmaceuticals to
primary care and other office-based physicians. As of March 28, 1997, the
Company operated 61 core business service centers in the United States
distributing to approximately 103,000 physician office sites in all 50 states.
In November 1996, the Company established a new subsidiary, Diagnostic
Imaging, Inc. DI or imaging division. DI distributes medical diagnostic
imaging equipment, supplies and service to acute and alternate care sites. As of
March 28, 1997, DI operated 14 imaging division service centers distributing to
approximately 6,000 medical imaging sites in 9 southeastern states.
In March 1996, the Company established two new subsidiaries, WorldMed
International, Inc. WorldMed Int'l and WorldMed, Inc. These subsidiaries
were established to manage and develop the Company European medical equipment
and supply distribution market European operation. As of March 28, 1997, the
European operation included 2 service centers distributing to approximately
1,000 acute and alternate care sites in Belgium, Germany and France.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSS and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
STOCK SPLIT
All stock-related data has been retroactively adjusted to reflect a
three-for-one stock split effective on September 22, 1995 which was distributed
on October 5, 1995.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect
to the mergers the Mergers with Taylor Medical, Inc. Taylor and X-ray
Corporation of Georgia X-ray GA. On August 21, 1995, PSS issued 3,790,215
shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding equity
interest of Taylor. Taylor was engaged in the distribution and sale of medical
supplies, equipment, and pharmaceuticals to office-based physicians and managed
care facilities in 24 states. On December 20, 1996, PSS issued 593,672 shares of
its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding equity interest of X-ray
GA. X-ray GA distributed radiology and imaging equipment, chemicals and supplies
and provided technical service to the acute and alternate site markets. These
transactions were accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting, and accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been retroactively adjusted as if PSS, Taylor and X-ray GA had operated as
one entity since inception.
Certain items have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
FISCAL YEAR
Beginning in fiscal year 1996, the Company fiscal year ends on the Friday
closest to March 31 of each year. The Company fiscal year ended on the
Thursday closest to March 31 of each year prior to fiscal year 1996. Fiscal
years 1997, 1996, and 1995 consist of 52 weeks.

USE OF ESTIMATES
In preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company trade accounts receivable are exposed to credit risk;
however, the risk is limited, as the balance is comprised of numerous individual
accounts, none of which is individually significant. The Company monitors the
creditworthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis and provides reserves for
estimated bad debt losses and sales returns. The Company had reserves for
doubtful accounts of approximately $3,581,000 and $2,218,000 as of the end of
fiscal years 1997 and 1996, respectively. Provisions for doubtful accounts were
approximately $2,463,000, $1,448,000, and $1,651,000 for the fiscal years ended
1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
CASH MANAGEMENT
The Company utilizes a zero balance bank account, and checks issued for
cash disbursements are funded by advances from overnight investments.
Outstanding checks are recorded as accounts payable until they are presented to
the bank, at which time the payments are applied against the overnight
investments. The Company had approximately $8,060,000 and $6,841,000 of
outstanding checks recorded in accounts payable as of the end of fiscal years
1997 and 1996, respectively.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash held at banks,
short-term government obligations, and money market instruments. The Company
invests its excess cash in high-grade investments and, therefore, bears minimal
risk. These instruments have original maturity dates not exceeding three months.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company classifies its marketable securities as trading securities and
carries such securities at fair market value. Net unrealized gains and losses on
trading securities are included in net income.
Marketable securities include municipal bond issues with maturity dates
exceeding three months and equity securities classified as trading securities.
Management intent is to liquidate these securities within one year.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term trade receivables and
payables, and long-term debt and capital lease obligations, approximate their
fair values.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are comprised principally of medical supplies and equipment and
are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market. Market is
defined as net realizable value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to thirty years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lease terms or the estimated useful lives,
whichever is shorter. Gain or loss upon retirement or disposal of property and
equipment is recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
INTANGIBLES
Noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives
of the agreements, which range from three to ten years. Customer lists are
amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years.
The Company has classified as goodwill the cost in excess of the fair value
of net identifiable assets purchased in business acquisitions which are
accounted for as purchase transactions. Goodwill is being amortized over fifteen
to thirty years using the straight-line method. Subsequent to the date of
acquisition, the Company continually evaluates whether later events and
circumstances have occurred that indicate a change in the estimated useful life
or recoverability of goodwill.
SELF-INSURANCE COVERAGE
The Company maintains a self-insurance program for employee health costs.
Additional coverage is provided by a third party for stop-loss based on maximum
costs of $100,000 per employee and approximately $53 million in the aggregate.
Claims that have been incurred but not reported are recorded based on estimates
of claims provided by a third-party administrator and are included in accrued
expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income
taxes. Deferred income taxes result primarily from the use of different bases
for financial reporting and tax purposes.
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
On May 5, 1994, the Company completed an initial public offering of
5,100,000 shares of its common stock at $367 per share, of which 4,200,000 were
offered by the Company. On June 3, 1994, the Company underwriters exercised
their overallotment option for an additional 765,000 shares of the Company
common stock at $367 per share. The proceeds of the sale after deducting
issuance costs were approximately $15,800,000. The Company used all of the net
proceeds to reduce outstanding bank debt.
On March 27, 1995, the Company signed a Distributorship Agreement the
Abbott Agreement with Abbott Laboratories Abbott providing for the
exclusive distribution of certain Abbott diagnostic products. As part of the
Abbott Agreement, Abbott purchased 825,000 unregistered, restricted shares of
PSS common stock. The proceeds of approximately $5,900,000 were used to reduce
outstanding bank debt.
Effective November 13, 1995, the Company completed a secondary offering of
11,500,000 shares of common stock at $17 per share, 8,800,000 of which were
offered by the Company.
During fiscal 1996, the Company merged with three medical supply and
equipment distributors in stock mergers accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method by issuing 290,586 shares of PSS common stock in
exchange for all of the common stock of the acquired companies. During fiscal
1997, the Company merged with one core business medical supply and equipment
distributor and three imaging division companies in stock mergers accounted for
under the pooling-of-interests method by issuing approximately 1,465,000 shares
of PSS common stock in exchange for all of the common stock of the acquired

consolidated financial statements have not been restated for periods prior to
these poolings due to immateriality.
During 1997 and 1996, the Company realized an income tax benefit from the
exercise or early disposition of certain stock options. This benefit results in
a decrease in current income taxes payable and an increase in additional paid-in
capital.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Financial statements for the Company subsidiary outside the United States
are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates for assets and
liabilities and weighted average exchange rates for income and expenses. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method. The Company adopted the disclosure provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, for footnote
disclosure purposes only, the Company computes its earnings and earnings per
share on a pro forma basis as if the fair value method had been applied.
NET INCOME LOSS PER COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARE
Net income loss per common and common equivalent share is computed using
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock
equivalents outstanding during the year. Weighted average shares outstanding for
purposes of this calculation were approximately 36,501,000, 31,454,000, and
23,762,000 for 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
The Company issued stock in the amount of $40,000 and $121,000 related to
acquisitions accounted for as purchases in fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The Company assumed net liabilities of approximately $1,610,000 and recorded
noncompete assets and liabilities of approximately $4,300,000 in connection with
the mergers of four other medical supply and equipment distributors accounted
for under the pooling-of-interests method in fiscal 1997. The Company also
assumed net assets of approximately $1,278,000 in conjunction with the mergers
of three other medical supply and equipment distributors accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method in fiscal 1996. Also, the Company incurred capital
lease obligations to obtain equipment of approximately $514,000 in fiscal year
1995. All of the above items were excluded from the statements of cash flows as
these items were noncash transactions.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CHANGES
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128 establishes new standards for
computing and presenting earnings per share EPS and applies to entities with
publicly held common stock or potential common stock and is effective for
financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997.
Management expects that the impact of SFAS No. 128 will not be material.
In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 129, Disclosure of Information
About Capital Structure. SFAS No. 129 establishes new standards for disclosing
information about an entity capital structure and applies to all entities.
SFAS No. 129 is effective for financial statements for periods ending after
December 15, 1997. Management expects that the impact of SFAS No. 129 will not
be material.

Deferred income taxes for 1997 and 1996 reflect the impact of temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The tax effect of temporary differences which create deferred tax
assets and liabilities at March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996 are detailed below:
1997     1996
Deferred tax assets:
Merger costs and  $ 1,455,000  $  204,000
Allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns.  1,359,000    717,000
617,000    681,000

Excess of tax depreciation and amortization over book
depreciation and   1,539,000  1,179,000

Gross deferred tax   1,539,000  1,315,000
5,400,000   1,689,000
Valuation       --   900,000
Net deferred tax  $ 5,400,000  $  789,000
A valuation allowance was provided in prior years for those temporary
differences for which utilization was uncertain. Based on an evaluation of the
realizability of deferred tax assets, the valuation allowance was reduced by
$900,000 and $956,000 during fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The income tax benefit related to the exercise or early disposition of
certain stock options reduces taxes currently payable and is credited to
additional paid-in capital. Such amounts approximated $1,832,000 and $2,687,000
for fiscal years 1997 and 1996, respectively.
At March 28, 1997, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
income tax purposes arising from mergers of approximately $4,486,000 which
expire from 2006 to 2011. The utilization of the net operating loss
carryforwards is subject to limitation in certain years.
8. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
A member of the board of directors provides legal services as general
counsel to the Company. Fees for such legal services were approximately
$132,000, $136,000, and $124,000 in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
A member of the board of directors is chairman and CEO of the insurance
company that administered the Company self-insurance program through December
31, 1995. Administrative fees paid to the company were approximately $484,000
during the first nine months of fiscal year 1996 and $339,000 for fiscal year
1995. The Company changed its self-insurance administrator as of January 1, 1996
to an unrelated party.

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In March 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Long Term Incentive Plan which
provides officers with performance awards, consisting of cash or registered
shares of common stock, or a combination thereof, based primarily upon the
Company total shareholder return as ranked against the companies comprising
the NASDAQ Composite Index over a three-year period. The maximum payable under
this plan to an eligible employee, whether in the form of cash or common stock,

to be granted at the full discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors. The exercise price of options granted under this plan may be no

All options are fully vested at the date of grant; therefore, all
outstanding options at the end of each period are exercisable. The weighted
average remaining life of the options outstanding at March 28, 1997 is 84
years. To date, 13,500 restricted shares have been issued under this plan.

FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS
Under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of stock options granted in the years
ended March 28, 1997 and March 29, 1996 have been estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for grants: risk-free interest rate ranging from 58% to 68 expected option life ranging from 35 to 5 years, expected volatility of 40% for
1996 and 55% for 1997 and no expected dividend yield. Using these assumptions,
the estimated fair values of options granted for the years ended March 28, 1997
and March 29, 1996 were approximately $29 million and $60 million,
respectively, and such amounts would be included in compensation expense. Pro
forma net income and net income per share for the years ended March 28, 1997 and
March 29, 1996, assuming the Company had accounted for the plans under the fair
value approach, are as follows in thousands, except per share data:
1997   1996
Net income:
As  $4,373  $ 1,339
Pro  $2,599  $2,315
Net income per share:
As  $ 012  $ 004
Pro  $ 007  $ 007
Because the fair value method of accounting has not been applied to options
granted prior to March 31, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may
not be representative of that to be expected in future years.
1997  1996
Weighted average per share fair value of options granted:
Incentive Stock Option    N/A   N/A
Long Term Stock  $1108  $691
Long Term Incentive  $1108  $673
Directors' Stock  $1322  $667
10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has an employee stock ownership plan ESOP available to all
employees with at least one year of service. Effective January 1, 1996, the
Company amended the plan to allow participants to direct the investment of a
portion of their plan balances. Prior to this change, the trustees directed the
investment of the participants' balances. As of March 28, 1997, the ESOP owns
approximately 2,034,000 shares of the Company common stock. Company
contributions to the plan were approximately $160,000, $120,000, and $85,000 for
1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively, and are made at the discretion of the
Company.
The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan available to employees
with at least one year of service. The plan allows eligible employees to
purchase company stock over the counter through payroll deductions.
11. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
POOLING WITH X-RAY GA
On December 20, 1996, the Company acquired X-ray GA in a merger pursuant to
which the Company issued 593,672 shares of common stock to the former
shareholders of X-ray GA of which 52,675 shares are being held in escrow as of
March 28, 1997 in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock
of X-ray GA valued at $110 million at the time of the merger. The merger has
been accounted for as a pooling-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
of-interests, and accordingly, the Company consolidated financial statements
have been restated to include the accounts and operations of X-ray GA for all
periods prior to the merger.
X-ray GA was an S-Corporation for income tax purposes, and therefore, did
not pay U.S. federal income taxes. X-ray GA will be included in the Company
U.S. federal income tax return subsequent to the date of acquisition. Separate
net sales, net income loss and related per share amounts of merged entities
are presented in the following table. In addition, the table includes pro forma
net income loss and net income loss per share amounts which reflect pro
forma adjustments to present income taxes of X-ray GA on the basis on which they
will be reported in future periods.

POOLING WITH TAYLOR
On August 21, 1995, the Company issued approximately 3,790,000 shares of
its common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Taylor,
including approximately 416,000 shares held in escrow to satisfy certain
obligations of Taylor related to its operations prior to the merger. Subsequent
to August 21, 1995, approximately 244,000 shares of common stock were returned
to the Company as settlement of the escrow and were canceled. These canceled
shares had no resulting impact on the net income per share calculation. The
merger has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests, and accordingly, the
Company consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the
accounts and operations of Taylor for all periods prior to the merger.

OTHER POOLINGS
During fiscal 1997, the Company merged with four other medical supply and
equipment distributors in stock mergers accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method by issuing approximately 1,465,000 shares of PSS
common stock in exchange for all of the common stock of the acquired companies.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been restated for
periods prior to these poolings due to immateriality. Accordingly, the results
of operations have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements
prospectively from the acquisition date and the accumulated deficit as of their
acquisition dates of approximately $47 million has been recorded as an
adjustment to the accumulated deficit of the Company.
During fiscal 1996, the Company merged with three other medical supply and
equipment distributors in stock mergers accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method by issuing 290,586 shares of PSS common stock in
exchange for all of the common stock of the acquired companies. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements have not been restated for periods prior to
these poolings due to immateriality. Accordingly, the results of operations have
been reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the
acquisition date, and the accumulated retained earnings as of their acquisition
dates of approximately $13 million have been recorded as adjustments to the
accumulated deficit of the Company.
ASSET PURCHASES
During fiscal 1997, the Company acquired certain assets, accounted for by
the purchase method, including accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, and
other assets of five medical supplies and equipment distributors for
approximately $142 million. The aggregate purchase price paid consisted of cash
of approximately $68 million, assumption of accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of approximately $74 million, and the issuance of 2,700 shares of
common stock with a fair market value of approximately $40,000. The excess of
the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired of
approximately $28 million has been recorded as goodwill and will be amortized
over thirty years. In addition, the Company entered into noncompete agreements
with shareholders of the acquired companies which provide for payments of
approximately $220,000 through the year 2001. The operations of the acquired
companies have been included in the Company results of operations subsequent
to the dates of acquisition.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
During fiscal 1996, the Company acquired certain assets, accounted for by
the purchase method, including accounts receivable, inventories, equipment, and
other assets of seven medical supplies and equipment distributors for
approximately $55 million. The aggregate purchase price paid consisted of cash
of approximately $28 million, assumption of accounts payable and accrued
liabilities of approximately $25 million, and the issuance of 5,700 shares of
common stock with a fair market value of $121,000. The excess of the purchase
price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately
$12 million has been recorded as goodwill and will be amortized over thirty
years. In addition, the Company entered into noncompete agreements with
shareholders of the acquired companies which provide for payments of $12
million through the year 2000. The operations of the acquired companies have
been included in the Company results of operations subsequent to the dates of
acquisition.
During fiscal 1995, the Company acquired certain assets, including accounts
receivable, inventories, equipment, and other assets, of nine medical supplies
and equipment distributors for approximately $116 million. The aggregate
purchase price paid consisted of cash of approximately $69 million, assumption
of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately $42 million, and
the issuance of approximately 70,000 shares of common stock with a fair market
value of approximately $05 million. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired of approximately $40 million
has been recorded as goodwill. In addition, the Company entered into noncompete
agreements with shareholders and an officer of the acquired companies which
provide for payments of approximately $23 million through the year 1998.
During fiscal 1995, Taylor acquired certain assets of three medical
supplies and equipment distributors for approximately $22 million.
For acquisitions accounted for as purchases, the results of operations
acquired have been included in the financial statements since the dates of
acquisition. Supplemental pro forma information is not presented because the
impact on the Company results of operations would not be material.
12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Although the Company does not manufacture products, the distribution of
medical supplies and equipment entails inherent risks of product liability. The
Company has not experienced any significant product liability claims and
maintains product liability insurance coverage. In addition, the Company is
party to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the
normal course of business. While any litigation contains an element of
uncertainty, management believes that the outcome of any proceedings or claims
which are pending or known to be threatened will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results
of operations.
The Company has employment agreements with certain executive officers which
provide that in the event of their termination or resignation, under certain
conditions, the Company may be required to continue salary payments and provide
insurance for a period ranging from 12 to 36 months for the chief executive
officer and from 3 to 12 months for other executives and to repurchase a portion
or all of the shares of common stock held by the executives upon their demand.
The period of salary and insurance continuation and the level of stock
repurchases are based on the conditions of the termination or resignation.
13. ABBOTT LABORATORIES DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
On March 27, 1995, the Company signed a Distribution Agreement with Abbott
Laboratories providing for the exclusive distribution of certain Abbott
diagnostic products. The Abbott Agreement, effective April 1, 1995, has a
five-year term, although it may be terminated earlier if the Company fails to
meet certain performance objectives. Under the Abbott Agreement, the Company has
become the exclusive distributor in the United States of certain Abbott
diagnostic products and reagents to office-based physician practices with
43
45
PHYSICIAN SALES & SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
24 or fewer physicians per office site. The Abbott Agreement also provides the
Company sales force with access to over 15,000 physician practices that were
not previously purchasing diagnostic products from the Company. Abbott products
constituted approximately 16% of the Company sales in fiscal 1997 and 1996.
Simultaneous with the closing of the Abbott Agreement, Abbott purchased 825,000
unregistered, restricted shares of PSS common stock. A three-year irrevocable
proxy to the PSS Board of Directors and a perpetual stand still agreement were
provided by Abbott in the Stock Purchase Agreement.
14. SALES OF ASSETS
On July 1, 1994, Taylor sold the assets of its Taylor Home Health division
for $12,000,000 in cash and an escrow receivable of $1,051,000 based on
subsequent receivables collections and other factors, resulting in a gain on
sale of assets of approximately $2,078,000. In March 1995, Taylor negotiated a
final settlement of the escrowed receivable which included the return to Taylor
of certain receivables. Taylor recorded a $600,000 reduction in the gain
originally recognized to record these receivables at their estimated net
realizable value. The net gain of approximately $1,478,000 is included in other
income for fiscal year 1995.
On November 30, 1994, Taylor sold the assets of its Labcare division, whose
principal business was the repair of medical equipment, for $1,100,000,
resulting in a loss of approximately $403,000. In March 1995, Taylor recorded an
additional loss on the sale of approximately $154,000 related to the write-down
of certain notes receivable issued in conjunction with the sale. The net loss of
approximately $558,000 is included in other income for fiscal year 1995.
15. MERGER COSTS AND EXPENSES AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
The Company recorded merger costs and expenses of approximately $12,100,000
and $15,700,000 in fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively, associated with mergers
accounted for as poolings-of-interests. Such costs include direct merger costs
consisting primarily of investment banking, legal, accounting, and filing fees
as well as consolidation costs from the closing of duplicate service center
locations, realigning regional and corporate functions, and reducing personnel.
At March 28, 1997, accrued merger costs were approximately $30 million.
During fiscal 1995, Taylor management concluded that recent industry
developments had affected Taylor strategy and operations. Taylor assessed its
relative position in its major markets and determined that competitive pressures
on margins and cost structures in its Arizona, Indiana and Massachusetts
distribution centers as well as the prospects for its physician consulting
services and equipment repair businesses would not result in full realization of
the future benefits expected from the related intangible assets. Accordingly,
Taylor management concluded that the intangible assets were impaired and
recorded a $4,388,592 noncash charge to write off the intangible assets
associated with these markets and operations.
