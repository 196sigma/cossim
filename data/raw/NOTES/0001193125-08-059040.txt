FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders Verenium Corporation We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Verenium Corporation as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Verenium Corporation at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Verenium Corporation changed its method of
accounting for share based payments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004 on January 1, 2006. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has recurring operating losses and an accumulated deficit of
$4371 million at December 31, 2007. These factors, among others, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The 2007 consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Verenium Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 16, 2008 expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company Verenium Corporation Verenium or the Company, formerly known as Diversa
Corporation, was incorporated in Delaware in 1992. The Company operates in two business segments, biofuels and specialty enzymes. Its biofuels business segment is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable
the production and commercialization of biofuels, in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass. Its specialty enzymes business segment develops customized enzymes for use within the alternative fuels, specialty industrial processes, and animal
nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput, lower costs, and improved environmental outcomes. As more fully described in
Note 2, Merger Transaction, in June 2007, the Company completed a merger with Celunol Corp. Celunol, a Delaware corporation that prior to the merger directed its integrated technologies to the production of low-cost
cellulosic ethanol from an array of biomass sources. Following the merger, Diversa was renamed Verenium Corporation, and Celunol was renamed Verenium Biofuels Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verenium Corporation. As more fully described in Note 14, Subsequent Events, in February 2008 the Company completed a private placement of convertible notes
and warrants, raising estimated net cash proceeds of approximately $45 million. Basis of Presentation
The Company has incurred net losses of $897 million, $393 million, and $1076 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2006
and 2007, and has an accumulated deficit of $4371 million as of December 31, 2007. Based on the Companys operating plan, its existing working capital is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund the Companys planned operating
expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements through December 31, 2008 without additional sources of cash and/or the deferral, reduction or elimination of significant planned expenditures. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. This basis of accounting contemplates the recovery of the Companys assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Companys plan to address the expected shortfall of working capital is to generate additional financing through a combination of corporate
partnerships and collaborations, federal and state grant funding, and incremental product sales. If the Company is unsuccessful in raising additional capital from any of these sources, it will defer, reduce, or eliminate certain planned
expenditures. The Company will continue to consider other financing alternatives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain any sources of financing on acceptable terms, or at all. If the Company cannot obtain sufficient additional financing in the short-term, it may be forced to restructure or significantly curtail its operations,
file for bankruptcy or cease operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be forced to take any such actions. 
104  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Verenium Biofuels Corporation
formerly Celunol, since its acquisition effective June20, 2007. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers cash equivalents to be only those investments which are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and which
mature within three months from the date of purchase. Short-term Investments Based on the nature of the assets held by the Company and managements investment strategy, the Companys investments have been classified as
available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value, as determined by quoted market prices, with
unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of comprehensive income. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity as defined by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board SFAS Statement No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities classified as available-for-sale are computed based upon initial cost adjusted for any
other than temporary declines in fair value and are included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as available-for-sale is included in interest income.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method, and includes material, labor, and factory overhead. If necessary, the Company adjusts its inventories by an estimated
allowance for excess and obsolete inventories. The determination of the need for an allowance is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales, as well as judgments, quality control testing
data, and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence. The Company maintained a valuation allowance of $350,000 at December31, 2007 and 2006. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. The Company generally invests
its excess cash in U.S. Treasury and government agency obligations and investment-grade corporate securities. 
105  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Companys accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for the sale of
products, amounts due from governmental agencies for costs incurred under funded projects, and amounts due from corporate partners under various collaboration agreements. The Company regularly assesses the need for an allowance for potentially
uncollectible accounts receivable arising from its customers inability to make required payments. The Company has a limited number of accounts receivable and uses the specific identification method as a basis for determining this estimate.
Historically, losses related to uncollectible accounts receivable have been minimal. The Company maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of $74,000 and $229,000 at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to ten years using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed over the
shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded depreciation expense of $89 million, $90 million and $125 million, which includes the
depreciation of assets under capital leases. Pursuant to SFAS No34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, the Company
capitalizes interest on capital projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. The Company amortizes the capitalized interest to
depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Included in the costs of its demonstration facility as of December31, 2007 is $07 million in capitalized interest, which was determined by applying
the Companys effective interest rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures on its demonstration facility. Goodwill
As of December31, 2007, the Company recorded $1061million of goodwill on its balance sheet all of which resulted from
its recent merger with Celunol, as more fully described in Note 2, Merger Transaction. The Company records
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to
allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company uses the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired. The estimates used to value and amortize
intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages. These judgments can significantly affect the
Companys net operating results. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and
certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, using fair value measurement techniques. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then a
goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The goodwill impairment test, which the Company performs annually as of October1st, compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination.
Determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is
recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. Estimates of fair 
106  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including
projection and timing of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparables, and determination of whether a premium or discount should be
applied to comparables. It is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are lower than the original estimates used
to assess the recoverability of these assets, the Company could incur impairment charges. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, if indicators of
impairment exist, the Company assesses the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows. If impairment is indicated, the
Company measures the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset. In connection with the Companys strategic reorganization,
the Company determined, based on an analysis of estimated future cash flows, that the Companys property and equipment carrying values were impaired as of December31, 2005, and recorded an impairment charge totaling $22 million to write
down the value of these assets to their net realizable value See Note 8, Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, are carried at cost, which management believes approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value of
our Convertible Senior Notes as of December 31, 2007 was approximately $105 million. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104,
Revenue Recognition and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Under SAB No104, revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met: i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; ii services
have been rendered or product has been delivered; iii price to the customer is fixed and determinable; and iv collection of the underlying receivable is reasonably assured. Billings to customers or payments received from customers are included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet until all revenue recognition criteria
are met. As of December31, 2007, the Company had $55 million in deferred revenue, of which $51 million was related to funding from collaborative partners and $04 million was related to product sales. Product Revenue The Company
recognizes product revenue at the time of shipment to the customer provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales through third-party distribution agreements, if the distributor has a
right of return, in accordance with the provisions set forth in 
107  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
SFAS No48, Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists. Under SFAS No48, the Company recognizes product revenues upon
shipment to distributors, provided that ithe price is substantially fixed and determinable at the time of sale; iithe distributors obligation to pay the Company is not contingent upon resale of the products; iiititle
and risk of loss passes to the distributor at time of shipment; ivthe distributor has economic substance apart from that provided by the Company; vthe Company has no significant obligation to the distributor to bring about resale of
the products; and vifuture returns can be reasonably estimated. For any sales that do not meet all of the above criteria, revenue is deferred until all such criteria have been met. The Company recognizes product profit-sharing revenue during the quarter in which such revenue is earned, generally upon shipment of product to the end
user, based on information provided by the Companys profit-sharing partner. Profit-sharing revenue is included in product revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Collaborative Revenue The Company
recognizes revenue from research funding under collaboration agreements when earned on a proportional performance basis as research hours are incurred. The Company performs services as specified in each respective agreement on a
best-efforts basis, and is reimbursed based on labor hours incurred on each contract. The Company initially defers revenue for any amounts billed or payments received in advance of the services being performed and recognizes revenue pursuant to the
related pattern of performance, based on total labor hours incurred relative to total labor hours estimated under the contract. The
Company recognizes fees received to initiate research projects over the life of the project. The Company recognizes fees received for exclusivity in a field over the period of exclusivity. The Company recognizes milestone payments when earned, as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator, provided that ithe
milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement, iithe milestone represents the culmination of an earnings process, iiithe milestone payment is non-refundable and
ivthe Companys past research and development services, as well as its ongoing commitment to provide research and development services under the collaboration, are charged fees that are comparable to the fees that the Company
customarily charges for similar research and development services. Grant Revenue The Company recognizes revenue from grants as related costs are incurred, as long as such costs are within the funding limits specified by the underlying
grant agreements. Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables The Company recognizes revenue from arrangements that contain multiple deliverables in accordance with EITF No. 00-21. This issue addresses the timing and
method of revenue recognition for revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service. In these cases, the Company recognizes revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as separate value for each element can
be determined, the Company has completed its obligation to deliver or perform on that element, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 
108  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Research and Development Research and development expenses, including direct and allocated expenses, consist of independent research and development costs, as well as costs
associated with sponsored research and development. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Cost of Product Revenue
Cost of product revenue includes both internal and third-party fixed and variable costs including materials and supplies, labor,
facilities and other overhead costs associated with its product revenues. The Company expenses the cost of idle manufacturing capacity to cost of product revenue as incurred. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of product revenue.
Share-Based Compensation In January 2006 the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Share-based Compensation. SFAS
No123R supersedes APB No25 and amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS No123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No123. However, SFAS
No123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure, which has previously been used by the Company, is
no longer an alternative. The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123R, using the modified
prospective transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense includes options vesting for i share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of December31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No123; ii share-based payments granted after December31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123R; and iii shares
issued under the ESPP after December31, 2005, based on calculations of fair value which are similar to how stock option valuations are made. Because this transition method was selected, results of prior periods have not been restated.
Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for share-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations. Under the provisions of APB 25, no compensation expense was
recognized with respect to purchases of the Companys common stock under the ESPP or when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of grant. Income Taxes Current income
tax expense benefit is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable receivable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, as well as the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carry-forwards. Deferred income tax expense is generally the net change during the year in the deferred income tax assets and
liabilities. Valuation allowances are established unless, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The effect of tax rate changes is reflected in income tax expense benefit during
the period in which such changes are enacted. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets. 
109  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS Interpretation FIN No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FINNo48 requires recognition of the impact of a tax
position in the Companys financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense. Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources, including unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. The Company presents comprehensive income loss in its Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. Net Loss per Share Basic and
diluted net loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company had 08million and 11million unvested restricted shares outstanding as of
December31, 2007 and 2006. Additionally, pursuant to the merger agreement with Celunol, 15million shares of the Companys common stock issued to former Celunol stockholders were placed in an escrow account until June20, 2008
to satisfy the indemnification obligations of Celunol for breaches of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement or any legal proceedings related thereto. For purposes of the computation of net loss per share, the unvested restricted shares and the shares held in escrow are considered contingently
returnable shares under SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share, and are not considered outstanding common shares for purposes of computing net loss per share until all necessary conditions are met that no longer cause the shares to

for options and warrants, was 94million, 50million and 89million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Such securities, had they been dilutive, would have been included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share.

Segment Reporting Effective with the merger of Celunol in June 2007, the Company operates in two reportable segments, biofuels and specialty enzymes. Its biofuels segment
is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels, in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass. Its specialty enzymes segment develops customized enzymes for
use within the alternative fuels, specialty industrial processes, and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput, lower costs, and improved environmental outcomes. In accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, the Company provides segment
financial information and results for biofuels and specialty enzymes based on total revenues, product revenue, product gross profit, total operating expenses, capital expenditures, and total identifiable assets used in managements assessment
of operating performance and operating decisions. Expenses shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocations methods could result in
materially different results by segment. Reclassification Certain reclassifications to prior period information have been made to conform to current presentation. Included in the Companys consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2006 was a reclassification of approximately $17 million from accrued expenses to accounts payable of approximately $15 million and accrued compensation of approximately $02 million to conform to current
presentation. Total current liabilities were not adjusted as a result of this reclassification. Effect of New Accounting Standards
Fair Value Accounting In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No157 applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards. Accordingly, SFAS No157 does not require any new fair value
measurements. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No157 will have on the Companys consolidated results of
operations and financial position. In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007. SFAS No159 allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and
liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that items fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in
current earnings. SFAS No159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw comparison between entities that elect different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities. Management is currently
evaluating the effect, that SFAS No159, if adopted, will have on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. Accounting for RD Nonrefundable Advance Payments In June 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue
No07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities. EITF No07-3 states that 
111  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized.
Expense should be recognized when the goods or services are used or in the period it is determined that such goods or services will not be used. EITF No07-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. Earlier
application is not permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption of EITF No07-3 will have on the Companys consolidated results of operations and financial position. Business Combinations In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No 141. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including
changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting. It also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and
development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred. SFAS No141R is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and will apply prospectively to
business combinations completed on or after that date. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No141R on the Companys consolidated results of operations and cash flows will depend on the terms and timing of future acquisitions, if any.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB
51, which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parents equity, and
purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the
face of the income statement and, upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS No160 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and will apply prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply retroactively. Management is currently evaluating the effect, if any, the adoption
of SFAS No160 will have on the Companys consolidated results of operations and cash flows.  2.
Merger Transaction Completion of Merger with
Celunol On June20, 2007, Diversa Corporation and Celunol completed their merger, and the combined company was renamed Verenium
Corporation. The results of operations for Verenium Biofuels Corporation formerly known as Celunol have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since the merger closing date of June20, 2007. In connection with the merger, the Company issued 141 million shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of Celunol,
and issued 09million options and warrants to purchase common stock in exchange for Celunol options and warrants that were assumed by the Company. As a result of and immediately following the merger, former Celunol security holders owned
approximately 24% of the Company, while former Diversa shareholders owned approximately 76%. Immediately following the merger, the Company had approximately 63million shares outstanding. 
112  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Merger Consideration The merger consideration was as follows in thousands, except per share data:  Issuance of Verenium common stock to Celunol stockholders 141 million shares at $1011 per share 142,900
Fair value of options for Verenium common stock issuable as consideration for outstanding vested Celunol stock options 955
Fair value of warrants for Verenium common stock issuable as consideration for outstanding Celunol warrants 3,155
Merger transaction costs 5,153 Total merger consideration 152,163 The fair value of the Companys shares used in determining the purchase price was based on
the average of the closing price of the Companys common stock for a range of four trading days, including two days prior to and two days subsequent to the merger announcement date of February12, 2007, which is also the measurement as
determined per the guidance in EITF No99-12, Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities Issued in a Purchase Business Combination. The options assumed were valued at a weighted average value of $998 per share, and the warrants at a weighted average value of $906 per share, pursuant
to the Black-Scholes-Merton BSM valuation model. The total option value aggregated $51 million, of which $955,000 was attributed to vested Celunol options and accounted for as additional purchase price, and $41 million as non-cash
compensation expense attributed to unvested Celunol options, which will be amortized to expense from the effective date of the merger over a weighted average term of 2 years. The options and warrants were valued under the BSM valuation model using the following assumptions:  Interest rate
45 Volatility
63 Expected life
410years Expected dividend yield Forfeiture rate
5 Merger transaction costs included fees for financial advisors, accountants and attorneys and other
related costs incurred by the Company in connection with the merger. In connection with the merger, the Company entered into transitional
employment and severance agreements with certain executives who resigned their positions effective with the merger. Costs related to executive severance pay include $23 million in cash costs for bonus and salary continuation arrangements for these
executives, as well as $23 million in non-cash charges for adjustment or acceleration of equity-based awards, pursuant to these agreements. Both the cash and non-cash charges have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December31, 2007. Purchase Price Allocation 
The Celunol purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at
June20, 2007, the date of the merger. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. 
113  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
based on reasonable assumptions. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of net assets acquired in thousands:  Current assets 7,229 Property, plant and equipment 30,099 Other assets 983 Current liabilities 5,972 Other long-term liabilities 28,710 Net assets assumed 3,629 Acquired in-process research and development 42,400 Goodwill 106,134 Total assets acquired 152,163 Acquired In-Process Research and Development The Company allocated $424million of the purchase price to acquired in-process research and development projects. Acquired in-process research and
development IPRD represents the valuation of acquired, to-be-completed research projects. Prior to the merger, Celunols ongoing research and development initiatives primarily involved the development of its patented and
proprietary biotechnology to enable production of fuel-grade ethanol from cellulosic biomass materials. As of the merger date, pursuant to authoritative guidance under SFAS No2, Accounting for Research and Development
Costs, these projects were not determined to have reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. Accordingly, the amounts allocated to those projects were expensed in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations in June 2007, the period in which the merger was consummated. The Company considers the research projects acquired at the
merger date collectively to be its Generation1 or Gen 1 technology. To date, the Company has demonstrated that its Gen 1 technology can produce cellulosic ethanol at a small scale in the laboratory and pilot plant, but
at yields and cost that are not yet commercially viable. The Company will require continued and substantial investment to develop its Gen 1 technology, and continues to believe that Gen 1 will produce a viable technology that will be deployed on a
commercial scale as early as 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the substantial portion of the Companys internal research and development personnel-related costs allocated to cellulosic ethanol process development of $58 million were
either directly or indirectly related to the further development of its Gen 1 technology. The values of the research projects were
determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects, and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. These cash flows were
estimated by forecasting total revenue expected from these products and then deducting appropriate operating expenses, cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of net cash flows arising from the acquired
in-process technology. These cash flows were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties given the projected stage of development of these projects at
closing. Due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects, discount rates of 40% were considered appropriate for valuation of the IPRD. The Company believes
that these discount rates were commensurate with the projects stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above. 
114  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitability of the combined company
may be adversely affected in future periods. The Company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the IPRD analysis were reasonable at the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions used
to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the Celunol purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to assets
acquired less liabilities assumed. The Company believes that the acquisition of Celunol will produce significant benefits, and also believes that the combined company is the first within the cellulosic ethanol industry to possess integrated
end-to-end capabilities in pre-treatment, novel enzyme development, fermentation, engineering, and project development. The Company
believes that these primary factors support the amount of goodwill recognized as a result of the purchase price paid for Celunol, in relation to other acquired tangible and intangible assets. In accordance with SFAS No142, the goodwill is not amortized, but will be subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a
fair-value-based test. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company will perform annual tests for impairment of goodwill and, if indicators of impairment arise, is required to perform a periodic assessment between
annual tests. The Company determined the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired. Pro Forma Results of Operations 
The following unaudited pro forma information shows the results of the Companys operations for the specified reporting periods as though the
acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of that period in thousands, except per share data:  Year EndedDecember31 2007 2006 Revenue 46,272 49,472 Net loss 74,319 47,508 Basic and diluted net loss per share 117 079
The pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily
indicative of the actual results of operations had the acquisition taken place as of the beginning of the periods presented, or the results that may occur in the future. The pro forma results exclude the $424million non-cash acquired
IPRD charge recorded upon the closing of the merger during the second quarter of 2007. Funding to Celunol Pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company funded Celunol $275 million in cash prior to June20, 2007 the merger closing date, subject to the
terms and conditions of a promissory note. This balance was eliminated as part of the Companys purchase accounting upon the closing of the merger.

short-term investments for other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers such factors as how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost and how long the market value of the investment has been below its
original cost. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred, and it is an other-than-temporary decline, the Company records a charge to investment income expense. The Company has not incurred any
such charges for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, or 2005. Gross realized gains from the sale of cash equivalents and
marketable securities were zero, $3,000 and zero, for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Gross realized losses from the sale of cash equivalents and marketable securities were $65,000, $12,000 and $140,000 for the years ended

Significant Agreements The Company has a number of
strategic alliances and relationships, the more significant of which include the following: Research and Development Collaborations Syngenta The following
summarizes the Companys relationship with Syngenta AG, and its affiliates collectively, Syngenta, a related party see Note 5, Related Party Transactions: In 1999, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Syngenta. In conjunction with the transaction, Syngenta Biotechnology purchased 5,555,556
shares of Series E convertible preferred stock which converted to common shares upon completion of the Companys initial public offering, paid a technology access fee, and provided project research funding to the Company, for aggregate total
proceeds of $125 million. Also in 1999, the Company formed a five-year strategic alliance with Syngenta. Through a contract joint
venture, named Zymetrics, Inc., the Company and Syngenta jointly pursued opportunities in the field of animal feed and agricultural product processing. Under the agreement, Syngenta received exclusive, worldwide rights in the field of animal feed
and project exclusive, worldwide rights in the field of agricultural product processing. Syngenta agreed to pay $200 million for the rights granted under the original agreement, which expired in 2004. In May 2004, the Company entered into an
agreement with Syngenta that continued the development and commercialization of novel animal feed enzymes beyond the five-year initial term of the 1999 Zymetrics joint venture agreement. During 2003, the Company completed a series of transactions with Syngenta and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Torrey Mesa Research Institute
TMRI. Under the transactions, the companies formed an extensive research collaboration whereby the Company was entitled to receive a minimum of $1180 million in 
118  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
research and development funding over the initial seven-year term of the related research collaboration agreement. The Company also purchased certain
property and equipment from TMRI and assumed certain miscellaneous liabilities under equipment maintenance contracts. Upon the closing of
the transactions with TMRI, the Company issued to Syngenta and TMRI a total of 6,034,983 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 1,293,211 shares of common stock at $2200 per share that is exercisable for ten years starting in 2008. The
total value of the acquisition was approximately $740 million, of which $549 million was allocated to certain intangible assets. In December 2005, in connection with its strategic reorganization, the Company recorded an impairment charge related
to the write-down of the carrying values of assets and technologies acquired as part of the acquisition See Note 8, Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities. In January 2007, the Company announced a new 10-year research and development partnership with Syngenta. The new agreement, which replaced a seven-year
agreement with Syngenta that started in early 2003, is focused on the discovery and development of a range of novel enzymes to economically convert pre-treated cellulosic biomass to mixed sugars, which is a critical step in the process of biofuel
production. The prior collaboration agreement with Syngenta was a broad research and product development collaboration in which the two
companies worked on various exclusive projects together across various fields. The prior agreement provided for a minimum of $118 million of research funding over the seven year research period, of which approximately $83 million was received
through 2006. The prior agreement led to product candidates for the production of biofuels such as ethanol from corn, and enzymes to improve the digestibility and reduce the environmental impact of phosphorus and other nutrients naturally contained
in animal feed. However, the prior agreement covered significantly more exclusive fields and applications than were ultimately being taken to the marketplace. The Company believes that the current agreement is more focused and better aligned with each companys core strengths than the prior agreement. Under the terms of the new agreement, Syngenta has committed a
minimum of $16 million in the first two years of the 10-year term to fund joint research and development activities, largely in defined areas of biofuels. In addition, the Company will be entitled to development- and commercialization-related
milestone payments upon achievement of specified milestones, as well as royalties on any products that are commercialized by Syngenta. The new agreement allows the Company the freedom to operate independently in all fields, and to market and sell
fermentation-based enzyme products developed either under the collaboration or by the Company independently. Syngenta retains the rights to market and sell plant-expressed, or transgenic, enzyme products developed under the collaboration in the
fields of animal feed and biofuels. The Company has also licensed its existing collection of enzymes for plant expression to Syngenta within these two fields. As a result of the restructuring of the Syngenta agreement, minimum guaranteed collaborative revenue was reduced by approximately $190 million, with $120 million of this reduction occurring in 2007. The Company also has a manufacturing agreement with an affiliate of Syngenta to supply commercial quantities of Quantum phytase at a fixed price,
determined by a negotiated formula that is subject to adjustment during the term of the agreement. In addition, the Company is entitled to receive royalties from Syngenta on sales of Quantum phytase. 
119  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Total collaborative revenue recognized under the Syngenta agreements was $93 million, $217 million,
and $241 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Total Quantum phytase product revenue was $34 million, $10 million, and $02 million for the year ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Bunge Oils, Inc. In February
2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Bunge Oils, Inc. Bunge, a part of Bunge North America, to discover and develop novel enzymes optimized for the production of edible oil products with enhanced nutritional or health
benefits. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for discovering, optimizing, and manufacturing enzymes, and Bunge is responsible for commercializing oils using new enzyme-enabled processes. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company received an upfront technology access fee, is receiving research funding for its enzyme discovery and development activities under the project, and is also eligible to receive milestone payments for successful enzyme development activities
as well as royalties on any products that are commercialized. In November 2007, the Company entered into an agreement with Bunge to
promote the commercialization of Purifine and the product development and commercialization of next-generation enzyme products for seed oil processing. Pursuant to the agreement, Bunge will supply process scale-up expertise for the development of
the Purifine degumming process at plant scale. In addition, Bunge will contribute to the funding of RD projects to develop next generation enzyme products for seed oil processing. Bunge and the Company will also share profits on sales of
Purifine enzyme. Collaborative revenue recognized under the Bunge agreements was $36 million, $22 million and $07 million for the years
ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Cargill Health and Food Technologies In 2005, the Company signed a collaboration agreement with Cargill Health and Food Technologies to discover and develop novel enzymes for the
cost-effective production of a proprietary Cargill product involving multiple enzyme steps. In 2006, this collaboration agreement was expanded to include additional enzymes beyond the initial targeted set. In 2007, this agreement was further
extended through May 2008. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received upfront payments and research funding, and is entitled to receive milestone payments, license fees, and royalties on products that may be developed under the
agreement. Revenue recognized under the Cargill collaboration was $09 million, $14 million and $21 million for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. BASF In December 2005, the Company entered into a master collaboration agreement with BASF under which the Company is responsible for the discovery and optimization of new enzymes, and BASF is responsible for process and
product development and commercialization. Under the agreement, the Company has received technology access fees and research support payments, and is entitled to receive milestone payments and royalties based on sales of products resulting from the
collaboration. Revenue recognized under the BASF agreement was $26 million and $23 million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006. The Company recognized no revenue from the BASF agreement in 2005. 
120  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
DuPont Bio-Based Materials From 2003 through 2007, the Company collaborated with DuPont Bio-Based Materials DuPont on the development of an integrated corn-based
biorefinery ICBR for the production of ethanol and other value-added chemical products from corn biomass. This multi-year program was co-funded by the U.S. Department of Energy DOE. The objective under the program was to
discover, optimize, and manufacture a cocktail of enzymes that can efficiently convert the different components of an entire corn plant, including the stalk, into simple sugars that can then be used to make ethanol and other products. In
2005, the Company announced that the performance of the enzymes developed under the ICBR program with DuPont substantially exceeded the initial targets set by the Department of Energy, and in 2007 the Company completed its work under this
collaboration. DuPont has the right to exclusively license a selected number of enzymes comprising this cocktail for use in converting biomass to fuels and/or other chemicals, in exchange for the payment to the Company of up-front license fees and
running royalties on sales of these enzymes on DuPonts revenues from licensing technologies to third parties that include one or more enzymes the Company may have licensed to DuPont. Revenue recognized under the DuPont ICBR program was $04 million, $15 million and $30 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and
2005. Government Grants and Contracts The Company has received grants and contracts from a number of government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health. Revenue related to
government grants and contracts was $27 million, $33 million, and $101 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $40 million in funding committed from various
government agencies through 2012. Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution Agreements Danisco Animal Nutrition In
May 1996, the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with Danisco Animal Nutrition formerly Finnfeeds International Ltd to jointly identify and develop a novel phytase enzyme that, when used as an additive in animal feed applications,
allows higher utilization of phytic acid phosphates from the feed, thereby increasing its nutritional value. The addition of phytase to animal feed reduces the need for inorganic phosphorus supplementation and lowers the level of harmful phosphates
that are introduced in the environment through animal waste, resulting in inorganic phosphate cost savings and a significant reduction in environmental pollution. Following the completion of the initial objectives of the agreement with Danisco, in
December 1998 the Company entered into a license agreement with Danisco to commercialize an enzyme developed under the collaboration agreement. Under the terms of the license agreement, the Company granted Danisco an exclusive license to
manufacture, use, and sell the developed enzyme. In consideration for the license, the Company is paid a profit share equal to 50% of the cumulative profits generated by Danisco on such sales. The Company also has a manufacturing agreement with
Danisco to supply commercial quantities of Phyzyme XP at the Companys cost to manufacture such quantities. In March 2003, the FDA approved Phyzyme XP Animal Feed Enzyme, which the Company developed in collaboration with Danisco. In September
2006, the EU Commission granted permanent authorization for the use of Phyzyme XP in broiler poultry feed in Europe. Additionally, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with Danisco to supply commercial quantities of Phyzyme XP at the
Companys cost to manufacture such quantities. Revenue recognized from transactions with Danisco, including contract manufacturing
performed on behalf of Danisco, was $162 million, $89 million, and $52 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.

Bayer Animal Health In December 2003, the Company formed a collaboration with Bayer Animal Health to develop and market products to prevent infectious diseases in fish. Under
the agreement, the Company collaborated to complete the development and registration of an existing pipeline of microbially-produced vaccine candidates for aquaculture previously developed by a Bayer venture. Under the agreement, the Company was
responsible for developing and manufacturing these microbially-produced vaccine candidates, which were to be marketed and distributed by Bayer in designated countries on an exclusive basis. In January 2006, pursuant to a corporate reorganization,
the Company announced its intention to discontinue further investment in the development of additional vaccine candidates The Companys single source of revenue from Bayovac SRS, the product resulting from the collaboration, has been through a licensing and collaboration agreement with Microtek International Inc, who has been distributing this product to Bayer Animal Health, since its
commercial launch in 2004. In late 2007, because of new entrants into the vaccine market and resulting pressure on pricing and margins, the Company made the strategic decision to exit the animal health vaccine market to focus on product
commercialization efforts in areas that are more strategic to its current focus, namely biofuels. In connection with this decision, the Company terminated its Licensing and Collaboration Agreement with Microtek, and will discontinue sales of
Bayovac SRS after 2008. Revenue recognized from Bayovac SRS was $15 million, $38 million, and $16 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. License Agreements Marubeni Corporation and
Tsukishima Kikai Co., Ltd In July 2001, the Company signed a Joint Development and Technology Transfer Agreement with the Marubeni
Corporation, or Marubeni, and Tsukishima Kikai Co., Ltd., or TSK. This technology transfer agreement with Marubeni and TSK covers certain markets in Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Under this agreement, Marubeni, TSK, and their partners
have built a 14million liters-per-year cellulosic ethanol production facility which is currently in the start-up and commissioning, and will be the worlds first plant operating commercially that will produce cellulosic ethanol from
construction and demolition wood waste. This plant, in Osaka, Japan, is expected to be expanded later to produce 4million liters-per-year of cellulosic ethanol per year. In addition, Marubeni has commenced construction on a 95million
gallons-per-year cellulosic ethanol facility in Thailand, and this consortium will make milestone and royalty payments to the Company for the use of its technology. University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. The University of Florida Research
Foundation, Inc UFRFI, has granted the Company an exclusive worldwide license to use, develop and commercially exploit the UFRFI technology and any extensions and improvements of the technology for the production of ethanol. The UFRFI
license expires on the later of October 2015 or the expiration of the last patent related to the UFRFI technology. Based on the latest to expire of the granted U.S. patents, the UFRFI license will extend into 2022. Pending and future patent
applications related to the UFRFI technology, if granted, would extend the expiration date of the UFRFI license beyond 2026. Xoma
Ltd. In 2003, the Company signed a license and product development agreement with Xoma Ltd., Xoma. Under the terms of
the agreement, the Company received a license to use Xomas antibody expression 
122  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
technology for developing antibody products independently and with collaborators, and an option to a license for the production of antibodies under the Xoma
patents. The Company paid an initial license fee of $20 million, which was initially capitalized and was being amortized over the estimated useful life of seven years. Under the agreement, the Company may also be required to pay future milestones
and royalties. As of December31, 2005, in connection with the Companys strategic reorganization, the Company assessed the carrying value of this license on its balance sheet and determined that it was impaired. As a result, the Company
has written off the carrying value of the license on its balance sheet as of December31, 2005 See Note 8Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities. Terragen Discovery, Inc. In
November 1999, the Company signed a license agreement with Terragen Discovery Inc., Terragen under which the Company and Terragen agreed to cross license certain technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made an
initial payment to Terragen of $25 million in 1999 and agreed to make annual payments of $01 million to Terragen to maintain the patent rights over the remaining patent life. The Company capitalized the initial payment as an intangible asset,
which through December31, 2005 was amortized over the sixteen-year patent life. As of December31, 2005, in connection with the Companys strategic reorganization, the Company assessed the carrying values of this license on its
balance sheet and determined that it was impaired. As a result, the Company wrote off the carrying value of the license on its balance sheet as of December31, 2005 See Note 8Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities.
Other Agreements The Company has
signed various agreements with research institutions, as well as other commercial entities. Generally, these agreements call for the Company to pay research support, cost reimbursement, and, in some cases, subsequent royalty payments in the event a
product is commercialized. The financial impact of these agreements on the Company is not significant.  5.
Debt Bank and Commercial Debt
The Company has entered into various equipment financing line of credit agreements with lenders to finance equipment purchases.
Under the terms of the credit agreements, equipment purchases are structured as notes and are to be repaid over periods ranging from 36 to 48 months at interest rates ranging from 699% to 1043%. The notes are secured by the related equipment.
On September30, 2005, the Company entered into a $146 million Loan and Security Agreement the Bank Agreement with a
commercial bank the Bank. The Bank Agreement provides for a one-year credit facility for up to $100million in financing for qualified equipment purchases in the United States and Mexico the Equipment Advances and a
$46 million letter of credit sub-facility the Letter of Credit Sublimit. The Bank Agreement was amended in October 2006 to increase the Letter of Credit Sublimit to $47 million. Borrowings under the Equipment Advances are structured
as promissory notes which are secured by qualified equipment purchases and repaid over 36 to 48months, depending on the location of the equipment financed. Borrowings will bear interest at the Banks prime rate 80% at December31,
2007 plus 075%. On September30, 2006, the Companys draw-down period under the Equipment Advances expired. The Bank Agreement
contains standard affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions on actions by the Company including, but not limited to, activity related to the Companys common stock repurchases, liens, 
123  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
investments, indebtedness, and fundamental changes in, or dispositions of, the Companys assets. Certain of these actions may be taken by the Company
with the consent of the Bank. In addition, the Company is required to meet certain financial covenants, primarily a minimum balance of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities. On February22, 2008, the Company executed an amendment to the Bank Agreement. Pursuant to the current amendment, in exchange for the Banks
consent to the private placement of 8% senior convertible notes and warrants, the Company agreed to expand the scope of the security interest under the Bank Agreement to include substantially all of its assets excluding intellectual property. In
return, the Bank modified the minimum cash covenant to reduce the required minimum liquidity from $25 million to an amount equal to 150% of the total amount of the Companys obligations to the Bank under the Bank Agreement. At December31, 2007, there was approximately $23 million in outstanding borrowings under the Equipment Advances and a letter of credit for
approximately $47 million under the Letter of Credit Sublimit, as required under the Companys facilities leases See Note 7Commitments and Contingencies. As of December31, 2007 the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under its various financing agreements. The Bank Agreement also provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of a material adverse effect on i the business operations, condition
financial or otherwise or prospects of the Company, ii the ability of the Company to repay its obligations due to the bank or otherwise perform its obligations under the Bank Agreement, or iii the Companys interest in, or the value of,
perfection or priority of the banks security interest in the collateral. In the event of non compliance or a material adverse effect, the Company would be required to cash-secure its existing obligations under the Bank Agreement $70 million
at December31, 2007. At December31, 2007, the Companys future minimum payments under its equipment financing
arrangements are as follows in thousands:  Year ending December31 2008 2,938 2009 1,096 2010 107 Total future minimum payments 4,141 Less amounts representing interest 269 Total future minimum principal payments 3,872 Less current portion of debt obligations 2,712 Non-current portion of debt obligations 1,160 Convertible Debt In March 2007, the Company completed an offering of $100 million aggregate principal amount of 55% Convertible Senior Notes due April1, 2027
Convertible Notes in a private placement, generating net cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $955 million. In April 2007, the initial purchasers exercised in full their over-allotment option to purchase an additional $20
million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes, generating additional net cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $193 million. The Convertible Notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, to permit
registered resale of the Convertible Notes and of the Companys common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. 
124  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued

and warrants, raising estimated net cash proceeds of approximately $45 million.  6.
Related Party Transactions Syngenta AG
The Company has had an ongoing research collaboration with Syngenta, a greater-than 10% owner of the Companys outstanding
common stock, since 1999. See Note 4, Significant Agreements. The Company recognized revenue from Syngenta and its
affiliates of $127 million, $227 million, and $243 million for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Accounts receivable due from Syngenta were $22 million and $04 million, and deferred revenue associated with Syngenta was
$41 million and $31 million, at December31, 2007 and 2006. In connection with its research collaboration with Syngenta, the
Company received $49,000 and $03 million in rental cost reimbursements from Syngenta during the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, which was recorded as a reduction in rent expense See Note 7, Commitments and
Contingencies.

Thereafter 22,076 2,422 19,654 Total minimum lease payments 52,693 7,222 45,471 The Companys executive offices are currently located in a 21,000 square foot building in
Cambridge, Massachusetts leased through December 2013. The Companys research and development facilities are currently located in adjacent 75,000 and 61,000 square foot buildings in San Diego, California. The facilities are leased through
November 2015 and March 2017, respectively. In October 2007 the Company entered into a sublease agreement with a subtenant to occupy approximately 52,000 square feet of its 61,000 square-foot facility commencing March1, 2008. The sublease
agreement expires in February 2015. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, rent and administrative service expense
under operating leases was approximately $45 million, $39 million, and $46 million, net of rental income and restructuring charges. As more fully described in Note 8, Impairment and Restructuring Activities, the Company
recorded a restructuring charge and related restructuring liability based on space vacated in its 61,000 square foot facility during 2006. During 2007, approximately 75% of this space was idle. Accordingly, the rent payments of approximately $16
million related to the idle space are not included in rent expense, but rather recorded against the restructuring reserve as paid. During
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company received $49,000, $03 million and $05 million of rent reimbursement from Syngenta, a related party See Note 6, Related Party Transactions. Letter of Credit Pursuant to
its facilities leases for office and laboratory space in San Diego, the Company is required to maintain a letter of credit on behalf of its landlord in lieu of a cash deposit. The total amount required under the letter of credit is based on minimum
required working capital and market capitalization, as follows  Working Capital Market Capitalization
Required Letter of Credit
Greater than $75 million N/A 100,000 50 million to $75 million
or 350 million 100,000 plus 12 months rent
Less than $50 million
and
Less than $350 million 100,000 plus 24 months rent
As of December31, 2007, the Company has an unsecured letter of credit in place pursuant to
this agreement for approximately $47 million, representing the $100,000 minimum and approximately 12 months current rent. 
126  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The letter of credit is issued under an existing Bank Agreement as described in Note 5, Debt. Any increases to the letter of credit
resulting from increases in rent or changes in working capital or market capitalization are effective upon notice to the Company by the landlord. As of December31, 2007, the Companys working capital was approximately $35 million and its
market capitalization was approximately $315 million. Based on this, and pursuant to the lease agreement, upon notice by the landlord the Company would be required to increase its letter of credit by approximately $5 million, to approximately $97
million. However, upon receipt of the net cash proceeds from its debt offering in February 2008 as more fully described in Note 14, Subsequent Events, the Companys working capital increased to more than $50 million and, as
a result, the required letter of credit remains at its current level. During 2008, if the Companys market capitalization remains
below $350 million and its working capital declines below $50 million, it will be obligated to increase the letter of credit to approximately $97 million. If the Company is unable to secure additional amounts for an unsecured letter of credit under
its existing Bank Agreement, or new financing arrangements, it may be required to secure the additional obligation with cash. Manufacturing Commitments During 2002, the Company entered into a manufacturing agreement with Fermic, S.A. de C.V.
Fermic, a fermentation and synthesis plant located in Mexico City, to provide the Company with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of certain enzyme products. Based on actual and projected increased product requirements, the
agreement was amended in 2004 to provide for additional capacity to be installed over the succeeding four-year period. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company can cancel the committed purchases with thirty months notice provided that the
term of the agreement, including the termination notice period, aggregates four years. Pursuant to the agreement with Fermic, the Company is also obligated to reimburse monthly costs related to manufacturing activities. These costs scale up as the
projected manufacturing volume increases. As of December31, 2007, the Company had minimum commitments to Fermic under this agreement of approximately $263 million over the next three years. In addition, under the terms of the agreement, the
Company is required to purchase certain equipment required for fermentation and downstream processing of the products. Through December31, 2007, the Company had incurred costs of approximately $161 million for equipment related to this
agreement. During 2008, the Company anticipates spending as much as $28 million in additional equipment costs related to the manufacturing agreement. As the Company continues to develop its commercial manufacturing platforms, it will be required to
purchase additional capital equipment under this agreement. The Company relies on Fermic as its sole-source manufacturer for large volumes
of commercial enzymes. Litigation Class Action Shareholder Lawsuit In June 2004, the Company executed a formal settlement agreement with the
plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit filed in December 2002 in a U.S. federal district court the Court. This lawsuit is part of a series of related lawsuits in which similar complaints were filed by plaintiffs against hundreds of other
public companies that conducted an Initial Public Offering IPO of their common stock in 2000 and the late 1990s. On February15, 2005, the Court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes and
granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject to modification of certain bar orders contemplated by the settlement. On August31, 2005, the Court reaffirmed class certification and preliminary approval of the modified settlement in a
comprehensive Order. On February24, 2006, the Court dismissed litigation filed against certain underwriters in connection with the claims to be assigned to the Plaintiffs under the settlement. On April24, 
127  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
2006, the Court held a Final Fairness Hearing to determine whether to grant final approval of the settlement. On December5, 2006, the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals vacated the lower Courts earlier decision certifying as class actions the six IPO Cases designated as focus cases. Thereafter, the District Court ordered a stay of all proceedings in all of the IPO Cases pending
the outcome of plaintiffs petition to the Second Circuit for rehearing en banc and resolution of the class certification issue. On April6, 2007, the Second Circuit denied plaintiffs rehearing petition, but clarified that the
plaintiffs may seek to certify a more limited class in the District Court. Accordingly, the settlement as originally negotiated will not be finally approved. On or about August14, 2007, Plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus
cases, and thereafter moved for certification of the classes and appointment of lead plaintiffs and lead counsel in those cases. The six focus case issuers filed motions to dismiss the claims against them in November 2007 and an opposition to
plaintiffs motion for class certification in December 2007. Both motions are pending. The Company is covered by a claims-made
liability insurance policy which it believes will satisfy any potential liability of the Company under this settlement. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and assignment of claims against the underwriters, and because the settlement has
not yet been finally approved by the Court, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be predicted. In accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies the Company believes any contingent liability related to
this claim is not probable or estimable and therefore no amounts have been accrued in regards to this matter. Valley Research, inc.
On December7, 2006, Valley Research, inc. VRi filed a complaint in the San Diego Superior Court against the
Company alleging damages in excess of $50,000,000 resulting from an alleged breach of contract. The complaint claims that the Company breached the parties distribution agreement and failed to produce certain enzymes according to
industry-standard specifications, thereby resulting in VRis inability to market and sell the product. On January8, 2007, the Company filed its answer and a separate cross-complaint alleging breach of contract, breach of the
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of Cal. Bus. Prof. Code sections 17200 et seq., indemnification, and declaratory relief. The Companys claims are based on VRis failure to pay outstanding invoices,
failure to meet certain minimum sales requirements in the distribution agreement, and indemnification based on a breach of VRis representations and warranties. VRi answered the cross-complaint on February21, 2007. On July10, 2007,
Valley filed a First Amended Complaint alleging various claims, including breach of contract, fraud, intentional and negligent interference with contract, and trade secret misappropriation and alleging the existence of a partnership. On
July18, 2007, the Company filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint identifying Verenium Corporation as the successor in interest to Diversa Corporation, and on July19, 2007, the Company removed VRis lawsuit to the United States
District Court for the Southern District of California based on diversity jurisdiction. The federal court granted VRis motion to remand back to the state court on December17, 2007.On January31, 2008, the Company challenged
the First Amended Complaint by way of demurrer, which will be heard on March21, 2008.On February15, 2008, the parties attended a case management conference where the Superior Court judge set a trial date of January17, 2009.
The Company anticipates filing a Second Amended Cross-Complaint that will include additional causes of action against VRi, pled in the
alternative, to recover its costs associated with the alleged partnership and for breaches of fiduciary duties arising from the alleged partnership. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against these claims, and, believes any contingent losses related to these claims would not be material. 
128  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Patent Interference Proceeding In February 2007, an interference proceeding was declared in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office between a U.S. patent assigned to the Company and a
pending U.S. patent application owned by Maxygen, with allowable claims directed to the Companys trademarked GeneReassembly technology. On February25, 2008 the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences ruled in favor of Maxygen and the
claims in the Companys issued patent were cancelled. The Company is evaluating this ruling to determine whether an appeal might be appropriate; however, the Company does not believe that this ruling will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company is also, from time to time, subject to legal
proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business. In managements opinion, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.  8.
Impairment Charges and Restructuring Activities During 2005, the Company recorded a $457million impairment charge for activities resulting from managements strategic decision to reorganize and refocus the Companys resources to advance its most promising product
candidates and programs that have the greatest near-term opportunities, and discontinued development of a number products and programs, primarily related to fine chemicals, animal health, therapeutic antibody optimization, and small molecule drug
discovery. The Company wrote-off the carrying values of tangible and intangible assets considered non-essential to the Companys current focus, or otherwise deemed impaired under the provisions set forth by SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. These charges are summarized below in thousands:

Excess or idle equipment costs 2,237
Write-off of intellectual property licenses 2,886 Total 45,745 In connection with the January 2006 decision to reorganize and refocus the Companys
resources, management commenced several cost containment measures, including a reduction in workforce of 83 employees and the consolidation of its facilities. Pursuant to SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities, the Company recorded net charges of $120 million in 2006 related to these activities. During the first
quarter of 2006, the Company completed the employee termination activities under this restructuring and no further payments or expenses related to employee separation are anticipated under this program. The facility consolidation costs were based on
estimates, representing the discounted cash flow of lease payments net of anticipated sublease income on the vacated space through its contractual lease term in 2016. 
129  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded $15 million of additional charges,
reflecting revisions in its estimate for the remaining net facilities consolidation costs upon executing a sublease agreement with a subtenant. Pursuant to SFAS No146 the Company is required to re-assess these estimates on a periodic basis. Accordingly, the Company may revise these estimates in future periods, which could give rise to additional charges or adjustments.

Segment Information and Concentration of Business Risk Segment Information Following the merger with Celunol on June 20, 2007, the Company consisted of two segments, as defined
by SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, identified as biofuels and specialty enzymes. The biofuels segment is focused on developing unique technical and operational capabilities
designed to enable the production and commercialization of biofuels, in particular ethanol from cellulosic biomass. The specialty enzymes segment develops high performance enzymes for use within the alternative fuels, specialty industrial processes,
and animal nutrition and health markets to enable higher throughput, lower costs, and improved environmental outcomes. Management assesses
performance and allocates resources based on discrete financial information for the biofuels and specialty enzymes business segments. For the biofuels segment, performance is assessed based on total operating expenses and capital expenditures. For
the specialty enzymes segment, performance is assessed based on total revenues, product revenues, product gross profit and total operating expenses and capital expenditures. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the specialty enzyme segment
comprised 100% of total revenues, product revenue, and cost of product revenue. Operating expenses for each segment include direct and allocated research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. In managements
evaluation of performance, certain corporate operating expenses are excluded from the business segments such as: non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring charges, severance, depreciation and amortization, write-off of acquired in-process
research and development, and other corporate expenses, which are not allocated to either business segment. In addition, management evaluates segment performance based upon capital expenditures and other assets that are specifically identified to
the business segment and excludes certain corporate assets like goodwill and other assets that can be attributed to, or utilized by, both business segments. Expenses and assets shared by the segments require the use of judgments and estimates in
determining the allocation of expenses to the two segments. Different assumptions or allocation methods could result in materially different results by segment.

Stockholders Equity Shareholder Rights
Plan On December13, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the adoption of a shareholder rights plan the
Rights Plan. Under the Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock a Right for each share of Company common
stock outstanding as of December22, 2000. The exercise price of each Right is $12500. Initially, the Rights trade with the
Companys common stock and are not separately transferable. However, subject to certain exceptions, the Rights will become exercisable iat such time that a person or group of affiliated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the Companys outstanding common stock an Acquiring Person or iion the tenth business day after a person or entity commences, or expresses an intention to commence, a tender or exchange offer that would result in
such person acquiring 15% or more of the outstanding Company common stock. In December 2002, in connection with the Companys entering into a series of agreements with Syngenta and Torrey Mesa Research Institute, the Company amended the Rights
Plan to provide that, with respect to Syngenta and its affiliates and associates, the threshold will be 22% rather than 15% for the aggregate beneficial ownership of the Companys common stock that their holdings may not exceed without the
Rights becoming exercisable. In the event a person becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right held by all persons other than the Acquiring
Person will become the right to acquire one share of Company common stock at a price equal to 50% of the then-current market value of the Companys common stock. Furthermore, in the event an Acquiring Person effects a merger of the Company,
each Right will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock of the Acquiring Person or the Acquiring Persons ultimate parent at a price equal to 50% of the then-current market value of the Acquiring Persons or the
Acquiring Persons ultimate parents common stock. The Board of Directors can redeem the Rights at any time prior to a person
becoming an Acquiring Person at a redemption price of $001 per Right. In addition, the Board of Directors may, after any time a person becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange each Right for one share of common stock of the Company. The Rights will
expire on December12, 2010 if not redeemed prior to such date.

Equity Incentive Plans and Warrants Equity
Incentive Plans Celunol Equity Incentive Plan As a part of the merger on June20, 2007, each outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Celunol common stock, whether vested or unvested, was assumed by Verenium and became an option to acquire
shares of Verenium common stock, under the same terms and conditions that existed in the Celunol plan prior to the merger. Options granted under this plan generally vest over a four year period and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. The
number of shares of Celunol common stock that was subject to each option prior to the effective time was converted into Verenium common stock based on the exchange ratio determined pursuant to the merger agreement. The Companys stockholders
approved the Celunol Equity Incentive Plan on June20, 2007. A total of 507,000 shares of Verenium common stock are reserved for issuance under the Celunol Equity Incentive Plan. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan In March
2007, the Board of Directors adopted the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan, and effective May7, 2007, amended the 2007 Plan. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan is the successor to the Diversa Corporation 1997 Equity
IncentivePlan the 1997 Plan. The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, performance stock
awards, performance cash awards and other forms of equity compensation. Stock awards granted under this plan generally vest over a four year period and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. The Companys stockholders approved the 2007
Plan,as amended, on June20, 2007. A total of 9,750,000 sharesarereserved for issuance underthe 2007Plan. 2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan In March 2005, the Board of Directors of the Company
Board adopted the Companys 2005 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan Directors Plan, and reserved a total of 600,000 shares for issuance thereunder. The number of shares available for issuance
under the Directors Plan will automatically increase on the first trading day of each calendar year, beginning with the 2006 calendar year and continuing through and including calendar year 2015, by an amount equal to the excess of
ithe number of shares subject to stock awards granted during the preceding calendar year, over iithe number of shares added back to the share reserve during the preceding calendar year pursuant to expirations, terminations,
cancellations forfeitures and repurchases of previously granted awards. However this automatic annual increase shall not exceed 250,000 shares in any calendar year. As of December31, 2007, a total of 966,000 shares of the Companys common
stock have been reserved for issuance under the Directors Plan. The Board adopted the Directors Plan as the primary equity
incentive program for the Companys non-employee directors in order to secure and retain the services of such individuals, and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company. Stock awards granted
under this plan generally vest monthly over a three year period and expire 10 years from the date of the grant. The Directors Plan replaced the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. As of December31, 2007, there were
approximately 540,000 shares outstanding under the Directors Plan and approximately 312,000 shares outstanding under the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan.

Employee Stock Option and Stock Purchase Plans 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan In
December 1999, the Board of Directors adopted the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. As of December31, 2007, a total of 3,631,000 shares of the Companys common stock have been reserved for issuance under
the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount, but only through payroll deductions, during defined offering periods. The price at which stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to
85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower. The Purchase Plan provides for annual increases of shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan. 1997 Equity Incentive Plan In August
1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan, which provides for the granting of incentive or non-statutory stock options, stock bonuses, and rights to purchase restricted stock to employees, directors, and
consultants as administered by the Board of Directors. The 1997 Plan was terminated by the Board of Directors at the time of the merger on June20, 2007. The incentive and non-statutory stock options are granted with an exercise price of not less than 100% and 85%, respectively, of the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock as determined by the Board of
Directors. The 1997 Plan allows the purchase of restricted stock at a price that is not less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the Companys common stock as determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1997 Plan vest over periods ranging up to four years and are exercisable over periods not exceeding ten years. As of
December31, 2007, the aggregate number of shares awarded under the 1997 Plan is approximately 14,220,000, with no shares available for grant. Share-Based Compensation Expense The Company recognized $110 million, $57 million and $09 million in share-based
compensation expense for its share-based awards for years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. These charges had no impact on the Companys reported cash flows. Share-based compensation expense was allocated among the following expense

pursuant to SFAS No123, recorded net expense of $08 million related to the amortization of share-based compensation during the year ended December31, 2005. The Company also recorded a non-cash share-based compensation charge of
approximately $01 million during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the acceleration of vesting on approximately 28,000 restricted shares granted to its former Chief Executive Officer. Under the modified prospective method of transition under
SFAS No123R, the Company is not required to restate its prior period financial statements to reflect expensing of share-based compensation under the new standard. Therefore, the results for the year ended December31, 2005 are not
comparable to 2006 and 2007. 
134  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During 2007, the Company recorded approximately $13 million of share-based compensation expense
related to the acceleration of vesting for approximately 319,000 shares of restricted stock for five former executives in connection with separation agreements relating to the merger with Celunol. Additionally, as part of the separation agreements
with the former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company recorded approximately $10 million of share based compensation related to the issuance of 261,000 shares of fully vested restricted stock in exchange for approximately
500,000 of unexercised stock options. The Company also recorded $01 million of share-based compensation expense during fiscal 2007 related to the modification of 376,000 stock options granted to its new Chief Executive Officer The Company has determined its share-based compensation expense under SFAS No123R for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 as
follows: Valuation of Stock Options Share-based compensation related to stock options includes the amortization of the fair value of options granted prior to January1, 2006 as well as the amortization of the fair value of options granted after
December31, 2005; both determined using the multiple option approach under the BSM valuation model. The fair value of options determined under SFAS No123R is amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options,
generally four years. The fair value of stock option awards for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006 was estimated on the date
of grant using the assumptions in the following table. The expected volatility in this model is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time awards are granted, based on maturities which approximate the expected life of the options. The expected life of the options granted is estimated using the historical exercise behavior of employees. The expected dividend rate takes into account
the absence of any historical dividends paid by the Company and managements intention to retain all earnings for future operations and expansion.  December31 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate

Valuation of ESPP Awards Share-based compensation related to awards issued under the ESPP after December31, 2005 are based on calculations of fair value under the BSM
valuation model which are similar to how stock option valuations are made. The fair value of ESPP awards determined under SFAS No123R is amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards, ranging from six months to two
years. The fair value was based on the following assumptions for the years ended:  December31 2007 2006 Risk-free interest rate

Valuation of Non-Restricted and Restricted Stock Awards The fair value of non-restricted and restricted stock awards is equal to the closing market price of the Companys common stock at the date of grant.
The fair value of non-restricted awards is charged to share-based compensation upon grant. The fair value of restricted awards is amortized to share-based compensation expense over the vesting period of the underlying awards, ranging from two years
to four years. Forfeiture Rate for Options and Restricted Stock Awards The Company is required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods on a cumulative basis in the period
the estimated forfeiture rate changes for all share-based awards. The Company considers its historical experience of pre-vesting option forfeitures as the basis to arrive at its estimated pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. A 5%forfeiture rate
was used for the first three quarters of 2007 but was increased to 10% in the fourth quarter of 2007 for all share-based awards as a result of the merger and a study of peer companies in the specialty enzyme and biofuels industries. Unrecognized Share-Based Compensation Expense As of December31, 2007, there was approximately $179 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the equity incentive plans. This
expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 16 years as follows:  Fiscal Year 2008 10,169
Fiscal Year 2009 4,005
Fiscal Year 2010 2,115
Fiscal Year 2011 1,222
Fiscal Year 2012 391 17,902 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of unvested stock
options awarded to all employees and officers under its stock option plans that had exercise prices greater than $1000. The unvested options to purchase approximately 710,000 shares became fully vested as of December8, 2005 as a result of the
acceleration. These stock options would have all become fully vested before or during 2008. The Company accelerated these options because the options had exercise prices significantly in excess of the then current market value $525 at
December8, 2005, and thus were not fully achieving their original objectives of incentive compensation and employee retention. The acceleration eliminated future compensation expense that would have been recognized in the statements of
operations with respect to these options with the implementation of SFAS No123R. The future expense eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options was approximately $11 million.

On July 13, 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
TaxesAn Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entitys financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under FIN 48, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on
the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likelythan-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50%
likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2006. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, and has commenced analyzing filing positions in all of the
federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. As a result of adoption, the Company has recorded no additional tax liability. As of December 31, 2007 the Company
has not yet completed its analysis of the deferred tax assets for net operating losses of $919 million and research and development credits of $27 million generated in years prior to 2007 and net operating losses of $276 million and research and
development credits of $02 generated in 2007. As such, these amounts and the offsetting valuation allowance have been removed from the Companys deferred tax assets. As noted below, the Company is in the process of completing a Section 382
analysis regarding the potential limitations on the use of the net operating loss and research and development credits. The Company is
subject to taxation in the U.S. and state jurisdictions. The Companys tax years for 1996 and forward are subject to examination by the U.S. and California tax authorities due to the carryforward of unutilized net operating losses and research
and development credits. The Company is currently not under examination by any taxing authorities. The Companys practice is to
recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, the Company did not recognize any interest or penalties. Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, the
Company did not record any interest or penalties. The adoption of FIN 48 did not impact the Companys financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.At December31, 2007, the Company had deferred tax assets of $369 million.These deferred tax assets are primarily composed of deprecation and amortization, capitalized research and development costs,
deferred revenue and stock compensation expense.Due to uncertainties surrounding the Companys ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets, a full valuation has been established to offset the net deferred tax asset.
Additionally, the future utilization of the companys net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation as a result of ownership changes that may have
occurred previously or that could occur in the future.The Company has not yet determined whether such an ownership change has occurred; however the Company is in the process of completing a Section382 analysis regarding the limitation of
the net operating loss and research and development credits. Until this analysis has been completed the Company has removed the deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards from its deferred tax asset schedule and has recorded a
corresponding decrease to their valuation allowance. When the Section382 analysis is completed, the Company plans to update its unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48.The Company expects the Section382 analysis to be completed
within the next twelve months. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets are shown below. A valuation allowance of
$369 million and $1289 million has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets at December31, 2007 and 2006 as realization of such assets is uncertain.

approximately $3156 million and $1580 million, respectively, which includes $211 million and $93 million, respectively, from Celunol pre-merger financial results which are currently under evaluation by the Company to determine if these credits
can ever be realized. The federal net operating loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2011 unless utilized. The state net operating loss carry-forwards will begin to expire in 2008 unless utilized. The Company also has federal research credits
of approximately $18 million which begin to expire in 2011, California research credits of approximately $17 million which will carryover indefinitely, and California manufacturers investment credits of approximately $07 million, which will
begin to expire in 2010. Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, annual use of the Companys net operating
loss and credit carry-forwards may be limited due to cumulative changes in ownership of more than 50%. As a result of the adoption of SFAS
123R, the company recognizes windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards
resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from January1, 2006 onward. At December31, 2007, deferred tax assets do not include $25 million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation.  14.
Subsequent Events 2008 Convertible Notes
Offering On February22, 2008, the Company completed a private placement of 8% senior convertible notes due April1, 2012 and
warrants to purchase its common stock. Concurrently with entering into the purchase agreement, the Company also entered into senior notes exchange agreements with certain existing noteholders of the 55% convertible senior notes pursuant to which
such noteholders exchanged approximately $185 million in aggregate principal amount of the 55% convertible senior notes for approximately $167 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8% senior convertible notes and for warrants to purchase
common stock. Including the 8% convertible senior notes to be issued in exchange for the 55% convertible senior notes, the Company issued $71 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8% senior convertible notes and warrants to purchase
approximately 8million shares of common stock. Gross proceeds from new investment were approximately $54 
141  VERENIUM CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
million and net proceeds from new investment, after giving effect to payment of certain transaction-related expenses and the cash cost of the convertible
hedge transaction described below, were approximately $45 million. The 8% senior convertible notes will be convertible on the date of
their issuance. Their initial conversion price will be equal to $409 per share. The conversion price will be subject to full ratchet anti-dilution protection and a reset provision whereby, to the extent the volume weighted average price of the
Companys common stock during the seven trading days prior to the one-year anniversary of the issuance of the 8% convertible senior notes is less than $355 per share, the conversion price will reset to the greater of $213 per share or 115% of
the volume weighted average price of the common stock at that time. The 8% convertible senior notes are subject to automatic conversion at
the Companys option if the Companys closing stock price exceeds $818 per share over a 30-trading day period ending prior to the date the Company provides notice of the automatic conversion to investors, the average daily trading volume
of its stock over that 30-trading day period equals or exceeds $3 million, and certain other conditions are met. The warrants are
exercisable six months after their issuance. The initial exercise price of the warrants will be $444 per share. The exercise price will be subject to weighted average anti-dilution protection. In connection with the transactions described above, the Company entered into a convertible hedge transaction, which is intended to reduce the potential
dilution upon conversion of the 8% senior convertible notes. The convertible hedge transaction is composed of two separate call options. Under the first call option, on April1, 2012 or earlier upon conversion of the 8% senior convertible
notes, the Company will be entitled to purchase 13,288,509 shares of its own common stock from the counterparty at a price per share equal to the initial conversion price or a proportion of such number of shares based on the proportion of the 8%

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures,
no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in SEC Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e as of December 31,
2007. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting as described below. Based on a number of factors, including our performance of additional procedures as discussed under Additional Disclosures and Managements Remediation Efforts below, our management has concluded that
the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP. The unqualified opinion, which contains an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern, of our independent registered public accounting firm on our financial statements as of
and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007 is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Previously
disclosed material weakness As we previously reported in our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2007, in connection with the completion
of the review of our financial statements for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007 by our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst and Young LLP, we noted a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting related to our biofuels segment, caused primarily by untimely and incomplete account reconciliations and insufficient oversight related to the financial statement close processes. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we began implementing a
number of measures to remedy the deficiencies, which at the time we believed would be complete by the end of fiscal 2007 and sufficiently remediate the material weaknesses as of December 31, 2007. Such remedial actions included:  Centralization of core accounting and financial reporting functions into San Diego;  Hiring of additional temporary accounting personnel to accommodate the increased workload created by the consolidation of the biofuels segment accounting in San
Diego;  Addition of new management to add critical oversight functions to our controls and procedures, including our Corporate Controller, our Senior Finance Manager for
the biofuels business unit, and our Chief Legal Officer; and  Implementation of substantive review procedures over our biofuels business segment year-end accounting procedures by senior finance and accounting personnel to
mitigate the risk of financial misstatements due to deficiencies in transaction-level process controls. 
144  Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:  1
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  2
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  3
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute
assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal
control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control
over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 using the framework set forth in the
report entitled Internal ControlIntegrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Management reviewed the results of this evaluation with the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors, and based on this evaluation, management identified deficiencies in our financial statement close process related to:  inadequate management oversight of the financial statement close process; and  an insufficient number of staff accountants with a sufficient level of knowledge. We believe that the combination of these two deficiencies result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented on a timely basis. Therefore, management has concluded that we had a material weakness and that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2007. 
We completed the acquisitions of Celunol Corporation, which we renamed Verenium Biofuels Corporation, in June 2007 described in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are in the process of incorporating the operations of Verenium Biofuels into our controls and procedures and we expect to
complete the process by no later than June 30, 2008. Managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the recent acquisition of Celunol renamed
Verenium Biofuels which was acquired in June 2007 and which is included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of Verenium and constituted $710 million and $536 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and no
revenues and a $175 million net loss for the year then ended. Management did not assess the effectiveness 
145  
of internal control over financial reporting at Celunol because of Vereniums intent to integrate the accounting functions and related controls into
existing operations. Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our
internal control over financial reporting which is included below. Additional Discussion and Managements Remediation Efforts 
On June 20, 2007, we completed our merger with Celunol, at which time Celunol became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Verenium, and was renamed
Verenium Biofuels Corporation, our biofuels business segment. As a result of the merger, we expanded our operating locations from a single corporate headquarters in San Diego, California to four separate operating locations in California, Florida,
Louisiana, and Massachusetts, and moved our corporate headquarters to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Since the merger date, we have been integrating our biofuels business segments systems, processes and internal controls over financial reporting
into our financial reporting systems, and over the course of that time noted deficiencies related to the oversight of the monthly financial close and review process specific to our biofuels business segment, which was formerly a private company. We
have been in the process of remediating such deficiencies over the past several months. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we accelerated our remediation efforts and consolidated our biofuels accounting function into our San Diego accounting
department. We believed that this step would remediate the material weakness identified in the third quarter of 2007 as of December 31,
2007; however our remediation efforts proved to be more challenging than originally anticipated due to the volume of transactions and level of complexity involved, and amount of time required to contemporaneously consolidate the biofuels segment
accounting functions into San Diego and prepare the year-end financial statements on a timely basis. Because of these challenges, the consolidated financial statement close process for the year ended December 31, 2007 was delayed significantly,
particularly for the biofuels business segment, and resulted in several adjustments to the financial statements some of which were identified as a result of the audit and some of which were identified as a result of managements review during the
financial statement closing process. We are currently implementing additional controls and procedures to remediate these deficiencies,
including:  recruitment of additional staff, including an accounting manager, and full-time accounts payable and general ledger staff for our biofuels business segment; and
additional detailed review procedures over accounting close activities. We expect these measures to be fully implemented on or before June 30, 2008. In addition, we have commenced recruiting efforts for a full-time internal control / compliance professional to replace or supplement our internal audit
professional services firm, which we utilize on a part-time basis. These actions we have taken to remediate these deficiencies are subject
to continued management review supported by testing, as well as oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We cannot assure you that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future and that we will be
able to remediate such weaknesses or deficiencies in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See the Risk Factor entitled As of December
31, 2007, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud and as a
result, investors may be misled and lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures, and the price of our common stock may be negatively affected in this Annual Report on Form10-K. 
146  Furthermore, SEC rules require that, as a publicly-traded company, we file periodic reports containing
our financial statements within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods. We must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our
independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting on an annual basis, as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may experience difficulty in meeting these
reporting requirements in a timely manner, particularly if a material weakness or significant deficiencies exists. Even if we are able to report our financial statements accurately and timely, if we do not make all the necessary improvements to
address the deficiencies, disclosure of material weaknesses may be required in future filings with the SEC. Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting As disclosed above, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company consolidated its biofuels accounting
function into the San Diego operations. Other than this consolidation of the accounting function and the remediation efforts noted above, there has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Verenium Corporation We have audited Verenium Corporations internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Verenium Corporations management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that 
147  
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of
and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Verenium Biofuels Corporation, which is included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of Verenium Corporation and
constituted $710 million and $536 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2007 and $175 million of net loss for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Verenium Corporation also did
not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Verenium Biofuels Corporation. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. A combination of deficiencies related to inadequate management oversight of the financial statement close process and an insufficient number of staff accountants with a sufficient level of knowledge resulted in a
material weakness in internal control at December 31, 2007. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and
extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2007 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 16, 2008 on those financial statements. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Verenium
Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. /s/ Ernst Young LLP San Diego, California March 16, 2008  Item1
