These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2015and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated February 29, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst Young LLPMiami, FloridaFebruary 29, 201672Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Certified Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiariesWe have audited OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework the COSO criteria. OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.As indicated in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. and EirGen Pharma Limited, which are included in the December 31, 2015consolidated financial statements of OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries and constituted 15%of consolidated total assets, as of December 31, 2015 and 68%of consolidated revenues, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. or EirGen Pharma Limited.In our opinion, OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of OPKO Health, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLPMiami, FloridaFebruary 29, 201673Table of ContentsOPKO Health, Inc. and SubsidiariesCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSIn thousands, except share and per share dataDecember 31,201520141ASSETSCurrent assets:Cash and cash  receivable, net193,87519,969Inventory, net39,68116,604Prepaid expenses and other current assets26,9049,389Total current assets454,058142,869Property, plant and equipment, net131,79816,411Intangible assets, net638,15262,649In-process research and  net34,71622,453Other assets5,2675,838Total  AND EQUITYCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$72,535$8,744Accrued expenses167,89960,912Current portion of lines of credit and notes payable11,46813,455Total current liabilities251,90283,1112033 Senior Notes, net of discount and estimated fair value of embedded  tax liabilities, net226,036167,153Other long-term liabilities, principally deferred revenue292,47050,205Total long-term   Stock - $001 par value, 750,000,000 shares authorized; 546,188,516 and 433,421,677   shares issued at December31, 2015 and 2014,  Stock, at cost - 1,120,367 and 1,245,367 shares at December31, 2015 and 2014,     paid-in  other comprehensive   shareholders equity attributable to  interests6,403Total shareholders equity1,979,794835,741Total liabilities and  of December31, 2014, total assets include$76 millionand total liabilities include $121 millionrelated to SciVac Ltd SciVac.

SubsidiariesNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 Business and OrganizationWe are a diversified healthcare company that seeks to establish industry-leading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets. Our diagnostics business includes Bio-Reference Laboratories, the nations third-largest clinical laboratory with a core genetic testing business and a 420-person sales force to drive growth and leverage new products, including the 4Kscoreprostate cancer test and the Claros1 in-office immunoassay platform. Our pharmaceutical business features Rayaldee, a treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism SHPT in patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease CKD and vitamin D insufficiency March 29, 2016 PDUFA date and VARUBI for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting launched by partner TESARO in November 2015. Our pharmaceutical business includes OPKO Biologics, which features hGH-CTP, a once-weekly human growth hormone injection in Phase 3 and partnered with Pfizer, and a once-daily Factor VIIa drug for hemophilia Phase 2a. We are incorporated in Delaware and our principal executive offices are located in leased offices in Miami, Florida.In August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bio-Reference, the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the United States, known for its innovative technological solutions and pioneering leadership in the areas of genomics and genetic sequencing. Holders of Bio-Reference common stock received 76,566,147shares of OPKO Common Stock for the outstanding shares of Bio-Reference common stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $9501 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $1238as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date, or $3405per share of Bio-Reference common stock. Included in the transaction value is $23 millionrelated to the value of replacement stock option awards attributable to pre-merger service.Through our acquisition of Bio-Reference, we provide laboratory testing services, primarily to customers in the larger metropolitan areas across New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Washington DC, Florida, California, Texas, Illinois and Massachusetts as well as to customers in a number of other states. We offer a comprehensive list of clinical diagnostic tests including blood and urine analysis, blood chemistry, hematology services, serology, radio-immuno analysis, toxicology including drug screening, pap smears, tissue pathology biopsies and other tissue analysis. We perform cancer cytogenetic testing at our leased facilities in Elmwood Park, NJ, Smithtown, NY, Clarksburg, MD, Milford, MA, Miami, FL, and Campbell, CA and genetic testing at our leased facility in Gaithersburg, MD, as well as at our Elmwood Park facility. We perform cytology testing at our leased facilities Frederick, MD, Milford, MA, Columbus, OH, Houston, TX and at our Elmwood Park facility. We market our laboratory testing services directly to physicians, geneticists, hospitals, clinics, correctional and other health facilities.In May 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of EirGen Pharma Limited EirGen, a specialty pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products, for $1338 millionin the aggregate. We acquired the outstanding shares of EirGen for approximately $1002 millionin cash and delivered 2,420,487shares of our Common Stock valued at approximately $336 millionbased on the closing price per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date of the acquisition, $1388per share.We operate established pharmaceutical platforms in Ireland, Chile, Spain, and Mexico, which are generating revenue and which we expect to facilitate future market entry for our products currently in development. In addition, we have a development and commercial supply pharmaceutical company and a global supply chain operation and holding company in Ireland. We own a specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients APIs manufacturer in Israel, which we expect will facilitate the development of our pipeline of molecules and compounds for our molecular diagnostic and therapeutic products.Our research and development activities are primarily performed at leased facilities in Jupiter and Miramar, Florida, Woburn, Massachusetts, Waterford, Ireland, Nes Ziona, Israel, and Barcelona, Spain81Table of ContentsNote 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of presentation. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and with the instructions to Form 10-K and of Regulation S-X. Principles of consolidation. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of OPKO Health, Inc. and of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.Use of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include short-term, interest-bearing instruments with original maturities of 90 daysor less at the date of purchase. We also consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of 90 daysor less as cash equivalents. These investments include money markets, bank deposits, certificates of deposit and U.S. treasury securities.Inventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell such inventories, remaining shelf-life, and current market conditions to determine whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories at our diagnostics segment consist primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, which is used in our testing laboratories.Pre-launch inventories. We may accumulate commercial quantities of certain product candidates prior to the date we anticipate that such products will receive final U.S. FDA approval.The accumulation of such pre-launch inventories involves the risk that such products may not be approved for marketing by the FDA on a timely basis, or ever.This risk notwithstanding, we may accumulate pre-launch inventories of certain products when such action is appropriate in relation to the commercial value of the product launch opportunity.In accordance with our policy, this pre-launch inventory is expensed.At December 31, 2015and 2014, there were nopre-launch inventories.Goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired when accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and arose from our acquisitions. Refer to Note 5. Goodwill, in-process research and development IPRD and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions at December 31, 2015and 2014, were $22 billionand $11 billion, respectively.Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, licensing and other transactions are generally recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. We determined the fair value of intangible assets, including IPRD, using the income method.Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value.Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, although IPRD is required to be tested at least annually until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon obtaining regulatory approval, the IPRD asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the IPRD asset is charged to expense. We amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, currently ranging from 3to 20years. We use the straight-line method of amortization as there is no reliably determinable pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. Amortization expense was $280 million, $109 millionand $111 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Amortization expense from operations for our intangible assets is expected to be $513million, $508million, $477million, $442million and $429million for the years ended December 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.Fair value measurements. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Investments that are considered available for sale as of December31, 2015and 2014 are carried at fair value82Table of ContentsIn evaluating the fair value information, considerable judgment is required to interpret the market data used to develop the estimates. The use of different market assumptions and/or different valuation techniques may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value presented herein may not be indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. Refer to Note 17.Contingent consideration. Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain prior acquisitions to their fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and decreases in the fair value as a reduction in contingent consideration expense. Changes in contingent consideration result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones, the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability. Contingent consideration may change significantly as our development programs progress, revenue estimates evolve and additional data is obtained, impacting our assumptions. The assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which may have a material impact on our results from operations and financial position.Derivative financial instruments. We record derivative financial instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value and recognize the changes in the fair value in our Consolidated Statement of Operations when they occur, the only exception being derivatives that qualify as hedges. For the derivative instrument to qualify as a hedge, we are required to meet strict hedge effectiveness and contemporaneous documentation requirements at the initiation of the hedge and assess the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis over the life of the hedge. At December31, 2015and 2014, our forward contracts for inventory purchases did not meet the documentation requirements to be designated as hedges. Accordingly, we recognize all changes in the fair values of our derivatives instruments, net, in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Refer to Note 18.Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally fiveto ten yearsand includes amortization expense for assets capitalized under capital leases. The estimated useful lives by asset class are as follows: software - 3 years, machinery, medical and other equipment - 5-8 years, furniture and fixtures - 5-10 years, leasehold improvements - the lesser of their useful life or the lease term, buildings and improvements - 10-40 years, automobiles and aircraft - 5-7 years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation expense was $142 million, $40 millionand $41 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Assets held under capital leases are included within Property, plant and equipment, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of their related leases.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value, or carrying amount for cost basis assets, of the asset.Income Taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. Our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment.Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015was primarily due to a $934 millionrelease of a valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in the assessment of recoverability following the merger with Bio-Reference in August 2015. This was partially offset by expense recognized on taxable income from the Pfizer Transaction during the year ended December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 14 for a discussion of the Pfizer Transaction.Included in income tax benefit is an accrual of $23 millionrelated to uncertain tax positions involving income recognition. We recognize that local tax law is inherently complex and the local taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions taken. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of tax matters in any jurisdiction may be significantly more or less than estimated. We evaluated the estimated tax exposure for a range of current likely outcomes to be from $0to approximately $500 millionand recorded our accrual to reflect our best expectation of ultimate resolution83Table of ContentsRevenue recognition. Revenue for laboratory services is recognized at the time test results are reported, which approximates when services are provided. Services are provided to patients covered by various third-party payer programs including various managed care organizations, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Billings for services under third-party payer programs are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated program payment amounts. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the programs are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2015and 2014, approximately 9%and 5%, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The increase in revenues from laboratory services, including revenue from Medicare and Medicaid programs, is due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015.Generally, we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers. Our estimates for sales returns and allowances are based upon the historical patterns of product returns and allowances taken, matched against the sales from which they originated, and managements evaluation of specific factors that may increase or decrease the risk of product returns. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property includes revenue related to the sale, license or transfer of intellectual property such as upfront license payments, license fees and milestone payments received through our license, collaboration and commercialization agreements. We analyze our multiple-element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting. Non-refundable license fees for the out-license of our technology are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement. We recognize non-refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and qualifies for treatment as a separate unit of accounting under multiple-element arrangement guidance. License fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations that do not have standalone value are recorded as deferred revenue, included in Accrued expenses or Other long-term liabilities, when received and generally are recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligations only after both the license period has commenced and we have delivered the technology. The assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment. If an agreement contains research and development obligations, the relevant time period for the research and development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process. Such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized, and as a result, management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of research and development on a quarterly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we recorded $819 million, $55 millionand $167 millionof revenue from the transfer of intellectual property, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, revenue from the transfer of intellectual property included $150 millionrelated to a milestone payment that TESARO, Inc. TESARO paid us under our license agreement with them and $655 millionrelated to the Pfizer Transaction. Refer to Note 14. For the year ended December 31, 2014, $50 millionrelated to a milestone payment that TESARO paid us under our license agreement with them. For the year ended December 31, 2013, $125 millionrelated to the sale of substantially all of our assets in the field of RNA interference to RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation RXi and $38 millionrelated to the rights granted to OAO Pharmsynthez Pharmsynthez for certain technologies.Revenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; there was substantive uncertainty at the date of entering into the arrangement that the milestone would be achieved; the milestone is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item by us; the milestone relates solely to past performance; and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are not considered to be substantive and are, therefore, deferred and recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.Total deferred revenue included in Accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities was $2329 millionand $67 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. The deferred revenue balance at December31, 2015relates primarily to the Pfizer Transaction. Refer to Note 14.Concentration of Credit Risk and Allowance for doubtful accounts. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are with companies in the health care industry and individuals. However, credit risk is limited due to the number of our clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic regions.While we have receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, we do not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related health care programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is 84Table of Contentsprimarily dependent upon submitting appropriate documentation. Accounts receivable balances prior to allowance for doubtful accounts and net of contractual adjustments from Medicare and Medicaid were $261 millionand $06 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.The portion of our accounts receivable due from patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk. At December31, 2015and 2014, receivables due from patients represent approximately 75%and 05%of our consolidated accounts receivable prior to allowance for doubtful accounts and net of contractual adjustments.We assess the collectability of accounts receivable balances by considering factors such as historical collection experience, customer credit worthiness, the age of accounts receivable balances, regulatory changes and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a customers ability to pay. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our reported net income loss is directly affected by our estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $252 millionand $19 millionat December31, 2015and 2014, respectively.Equity-based compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We record excess tax benefits, realized from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash inflow and as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations. Equity-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of equity-based compensation to non-employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $261 million, $148 millionand $110 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation expense. Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and fundings arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. Research and development employee-related expenses include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities. We expense these costs in the period in which they are incurred. We estimate our liabilities for research and development expenses in order to match the recognition of expenses to the period in which the actual services are received. As such, accrued liabilities related to third party research and development activities are recognized based upon our estimate of services received and degree of completion of the services in accordance with the specific third party contract.We record expense for in-process research and development projects acquired as asset acquisitions which have not reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use. For in-process research and development projects acquired in business combinations, the in-process research and development project is capitalized and evaluated for impairment until the development process has been completed. Once the development process has been completed the asset will be amortized over its remaining useful life.Segment reporting. Our chief operating decision-maker CODM is Phillip Frost, M.D., our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM reviews our operating results and operating plans and makes resource allocation decisions on a Company-wide or aggregate basis. We currently manage our operations in tworeportable segments, pharmaceutical and diagnostics. The pharmaceutical segment consists of our pharmaceutical operations we acquired in Chile, Mexico, Ireland, Israel and Spain and our pharmaceutical research and development. The diagnostics segment primarily consists of our clinical laboratory operations we acquired through the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and OPKO Lab and our point-of-care operations. There are no significant inter-segment sales. We evaluate the performance of each segment based on operating profit or loss. There is no inter-segment allocation of interest expense and income taxes. Shipping and Handling Costs. We do not charge customers for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs are classified as Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.Foreign Currency Translation. The financial statements of certain of our foreign operations are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. The local currency assets and liabilities are generally translated at the rate of exchange to the United States U.S. dollar on the balance sheet date and the local currency revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange to the U.S. dollar during the reporting periods. Foreign currency transaction gains losses have been reflected as a component of Other income expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations and foreign currency translation gains losses have been included as a component of the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $24 million, $48 million and $03 million, respectively of transaction gains losses85Table of ContentsVariable interest entities. The consolidation of variable interest entities VIE is required when an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest in a VIE will have both of the following characteristics: a the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In July 2015, we deconsolidated SciVac Therapeutics Inc., STI, and account for our retained interest in STI as an equity method investment. Refer to Note 4.Investments. We have made strategic investments in development stage and emerging companies. We record these investments as equity method investments or investments available for sale based on our percentage of ownership and whether we have significant influence over the operations of the investees. Investments for which it is not practical to estimate fair value and which we do not have significant influence are accounted for as cost method investments. For investments classified under the equity method of accounting, we record our proportionate share of their losses in Losses from investments in investees in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Refer to Note 4. For investments classified as available for sale, we record changes in their fair value as unrealized gain or loss in Other comprehensive income loss based on their closing price per share at the end of each reporting period. Refer to Note 4.Recent accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU, ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards that removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies can choose to apply the ASU using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating both methods of adoption and the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. ASU No. 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU No. 2014-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. The amendments can be applied either prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards. We expect to apply the ASU prospectively and do not expect the adoption to have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, to provide guidance on managements responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a companys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be material.In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No2015-02, Consolidation Topic 810: Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which amends current consolidation guidance including changes to both the variable and voting interest models used by companies to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. The requirements from ASU 2015-02 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2015-02 on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be material.In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No2015-11, Inventory Topic 330: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which changes the measurement principle for entities that do not measure inventory using the last-in, first-out LIFO or retail inventory method from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No2015-16, Business Combinations Topic 805: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which replaces the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively with a requirement that an acquirer recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer record, in the same periods financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, 86Table of Contentscalculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance, with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. Our early adoption of ASU 2015-16 in the third quarter of 2015 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We adopted the provisions of this ASU prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not retrospectively adjust the prior periods. The adoption of this ASU will simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes and reduce complexity without decreasing the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Note 3 Loss Per ShareBasic loss per share is computed by dividing our net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. For diluted earnings per share, the dilutive impact of stock options, warrants and bifurcated conversion option of the 2033 Senior Notes is determined by applying the treasury stock method. In the periods in which their effect would be antidilutive, no effect has been given to outstanding options, warrants or the potentially dilutive shares issuable pursuant to the 2033 Senior Notes defined in Note 6 in the dilutive computation. A total of 14,269,717, 28,456,149and 32,105,859potential shares of Common Stock have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because their inclusion would be antidilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2015, 25,686,153Common Stock options and Common Stock warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock were exercised, resulting in the issuance of 24,466,106shares of Common Stock. Of the 25,686,153Common Stock options and Common Stock warrants exercised, 1,220,047shares of Common Stock were surrendered in lieu of a cash payment via the net exercise feature of the agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 5,787,983Common Stock options and Common Stock warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock were exercised, resulting in the issuance of 5,392,741shares of Common Stock. Of the 5,787,983Common Stock options and Common Stock warrants exercised, 426shares of Common Stock were surrendered in lieu of a cash payment via the net exercise feature of the agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2013, 10,881,570Common Stock options and Common Stock warrants to purchase shares of our Common Stock were exercised, resulting in the issuance of 10,732,745shares of Common Stock. Of the 10,881,570Common Stock options and Common Stock warrants exercised, 148,825shares of Common Stock were surrendered in lieu of a cash payment via the net exercise feature of the agreements. Note 4 Acquisitions, Investments and Licenses Bio-Reference acquisitionIn August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bio-Reference, the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the United States, known for its innovative technological solutions and pioneering leadership in the areas of genomics and genetic sequencing. Holders of Bio-Reference common stock received 76,566,147shares of OPKO Common Stock for the outstanding shares of Bio-Reference common stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $9501 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $1238as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date, or $3405per share of Bio-Reference common stock. Included in the transaction value is $23 millionrelated to the value of replacement stock option awards attributable to pre-merger service.The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation and the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Bio-Reference at the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation for Bio-Reference is preliminary pending completion of the fair value analysis of acquired assets and liabilities:87Table of ContentsIn  price:Value of OPKO Common Stock issued to Bio-Reference shareholders$947,889Value of replacement stock options awards to holders of Bio-Reference stock options2,259Total purchase price$950,148Preliminary value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed:Current assets Cash and cash equivalents$15,800Accounts  current assets, principally deferred tax assets61,135Total current assets264,773Property, plant and equipment112,457Intangible assets:Trade name47,100Customer  intangible  assets13,265Total assets1,379,879Accounts payable 77,908Accrued expenses30,848Income taxes payable437Lines of credit and notes payable 65,701Capital lease obligations18,293Deferred tax liability non-current236,544Total purchase price$950,148During the fourth quarter of 2015, we continued to finalize our purchase price allocation during the measurement period and obtained new fair value information related to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Bio-Reference. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we adjusted the purchase price allocation initially recorded in the third quarter of 2015 by increasing accounts receivable by $52 million, decreasing Inventory by $02 million, increasing Other current assets by $70 million, increasing Property, plant and equipment by $62 million, decreasing intangible assets by $69 million, decreasing Goodwill by $316 million, increasing Other assets long-term by $11 million, decreasing Accounts payable by $15 million, increasing accrued expenses by $16 million, decreasing Income taxes payable by $200 millionand increasing Deferred tax liability by $05 million. These adjustments did not have a significant impact on our fourth quarter results of operations or cash flows.Goodwill from the acquisition of Bio-Reference principally relates to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition for instance, Bio-References assembled workforce, our expectation to develop and market new products, and the deferred tax liability generated as a result of the transaction. Goodwill is not tax deductible for income tax purposes and was assigned to the diagnostics reporting segment.Revenue and Net loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015includes revenue and net income of Bio-Reference from the date of acquisition to December31, 2015of $3219 millionand $32 million, respectively88Table of ContentsThe preliminary amortization periods for intangible assets acquired are 5years for trade name, 10-20years for customer relationships, 8-12years for technology and 3years for internally developed software. We recognized $62 millionof acquisition related costs for the acquisition of Bio-Reference that were expensed in the current period as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense.Pro forma disclosure for Bio-Reference acquisitionThe pro forma information has been prepared utilizing period ends that differ by less than 93days, as permitted by Regulation S-X. We are a registrant with a fiscal year that ends on December 31 and Bio-Reference was a registrant with a fiscal year that ended on October 31. The pro forma results for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014 combines the results of operations of OPKO and Bio-Reference, giving effect to the merger as if it occurred on January 1, 2014, and are based on the individual consolidated statement of operations of OPKO as of December31, 2015and 2014 and Bio-Reference as of October 31, 2015 and 2014.For the year ended December 31,In  loss19,456140,854Net loss attributable to common  pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only. The financial information may not necessarily reflect our future results of operations or what the results of operations would have been had we owned and operated Bio-Reference as of the beginning of the period presented.EirGen Pharma Limited acquisitionIn May 2015, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of EirGen, a specialty pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products, for $1338 millionin the aggregate. We acquired the outstanding shares of EirGen for approximately $1002 millionin cash and delivered 2,420,487shares of our Common Stock valued at approximately $336 millionbased on the closing price per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date of the acquisition, $1388per share. 89Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation and the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of EirGen at the date of acquisition.

The fair value of the accounts receivable equals the gross contractual amount at the date of acquisition.During the fourth quarter of 2015, we continued to finalize our purchase price allocation during the measurement period and obtained new fair value information related to certain assets acquired of EirGen. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we adjusted the purchase price allocation initially recorded in the third quarter of 2015 by decreasing IPRD assets by $190 million, increasing Goodwill by $166 millionand decreasing Deferred tax liability by $25 million.Goodwill from the acquisition of EirGen principally relates to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition for instance, EirGens assembled workforce, our expectation to develop and market new products, and the deferred tax liability generated as a result of this being a partial stock transaction. Goodwill is not tax deductible for income tax purposes and was assigned to the pharmaceutical reporting segment.Revenue and Net loss in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015includes revenue and net income of EirGen from the date of acquisition to December31, 2015of $135 millionand $14 million, respectively.Our IPRD assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval, the IPRD assets are then accounted for as finite-lived intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. We amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, currently ranging from 3to 20years.We recognized $05 millionof acquisition related costs for the acquisition of EirGen that were expensed in the current period as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense.Pro forma disclosure for EirGen acquisitionThe following table includes the pro forma results for the years ended December 31, 2015and 2014 of the combined companies as though the acquisition of EirGen had been completed as of the beginning of the period presented90Table of ContentsFor the year ended December 31,In  loss32,481176,563Net loss attributable to common  pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only.

Inspiro, an Israeli medical device company developing a new platform to deliver small molecule drugs such as corticosteroids and beta agonists and larger molecules to treat respiratory diseases. In connection with the transaction, we paid $15 millionin cash and delivered 999,556shares of our Common Stock valued at $86 million.Inspiros Inspiromaticis a smart easy-to-use dry powder inhaler with several advantages over existing devices. We anticipate that this innovative device will play a valuable role in the improvement of therapy for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis and other respiratory diseases. We recorded the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded the assets and liabilities at fair value. As the asset had no alternative future use, we recorded $101 millionof acquired in-process research and development expenses. We record expense for in-process research and development projects accounted for as asset acquisitions which have not reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use.InvestmentsThe following table reflects the accounting method, carrying value and underlying equity in net assets of our unconsolidated investments as of December31, 2015:in thousandsInvestment typeInvestment Carrying ValueUnderlying Equity in Net AssetsEquity method  interest entity, equity method1,26891Available for sale investments3,615Warrants and options5,338Total carrying value of investments$34,716Equity Method InvestmentsOur equity method investments consist of investments in Pharmsynthez ownership 17%, Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. COCP 8%, Sevion Therapeutics, Inc. Sevion 3%, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. 1%, Neovasc Inc. 4%, STI 25% and InCellDx, Inc. 27%. The total assets, liabilities, and net losses of our equity method investees as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015were $3831 million, $616 million, and $733 million, respectively. We have determined that we and/or our related parties can significantly influence the success of our equity method investments through our board representation and voting power. Accordingly, we account for our investment in these entities under the equity method. For investments classified under the equity method of accounting, we record our proportionate share of their losses in Loss from investments in investees in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The aggregate value of our equity method investments based on the quoted market price of their common stock and the number of shares held by us as of December31, 2015is $896 million. Available for Sale InvestmentsOur available for sale investments consist of investments in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation RXi ownership 3%, ChromaDex Corporation 2%, MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. MabVax 1% and ARNO Therapeutics, Inc. ARNO 4%. We have determined that our ownership, along with that of our related parties, does not provide us with significant influence over the operations of our available for sale investments. Accordingly, we account for our investment in these entities as available 91Table of Contentsfor sale, and we record changes in these investments as an unrealized gain or loss in Other comprehensive income loss each reporting period. Based on our evaluation of the value of our investment in RXi, including RXis decreasing stock price during the year ended December31, 2015, we determined that the decline in fair value of our RXi common shares was other-than-temporary and recorded an impairment charge of $73 millionin Other income expense, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015to write our investment in RXi common shares down to its fair value of $09 millionas of December31, 2015. Based on our evaluation of the value of our investment in ARNO, including ARNOs decreasing stock price during the year ended December 31, 2014, we determined that the decline in fair value of our ARNO common shares was other-than-temporary and recorded an impairment charge of $14 millionin Other income expense, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014to write our investment in ARNO common shares down to its fair value of $06 millionas of December 31, 2014.

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.Warrants and OptionsIn addition to our equity method investments and available for sale investments, we hold options to purchase 10 millionadditional shares of Neovasc, which are fully vested as of December 31, 2015, and 10 million, 08 million, 05 millionand 18 millionwarrants to purchase additional shares of COCP, ARNO, Sevion and MabVax, respectively. We recorded the changes in the fair value of the options and warrants in Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We record the fair value of the options and warrants in Investments, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See further discussion of the Companys options and warrants in Note 17 and Note 18.Investments in variable interest entitiesWe have determined that we hold variable interests in Zebra Biologics, Inc. Zebra. We made this determination as a result of our assessment that Zebra does not have sufficient resources to carry out its principal activities without additional financial support.We own 1,260,000shares of Zebra Series A-2 Preferred Stock and 900,000shares of Zebra restricted common stock ownership 29%at December 31, 2015. Zebra is a privately held biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of biosuperior antibody therapeutics and complex drugs. Dr. Richard Lerner, M.D., a member of our Board of Directors, is a founder of Zebra and, along with Dr. Frost, serves as a member of Zebras Board of Directors. In order to determine the primary beneficiary of Zebra, we evaluated our investment and our related parties investment, as well as our investment combined with the related party groups investment to identify if we had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Zebra. We determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zebras economic performance. Based on the capital structure, governing documents and overall business operations of Zebra, we determined that, while a VIE, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Zebras economic performance. We did determine, however, that we can significantly influence the success of Zebra through our board representation and voting power. Therefore, we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Zebras operations and account for our investment in Zebra under the equity method.Investment in SciVacIn June 2012, we acquired a 50%stock ownership in SciVac from FDS Pharma LLP FDS. SciVac was a privately-held Israeli company that produced a third-generation hepatitis B-vaccine. From November 2012 through June 2015, we loaned to SciVac a combined $79 millionfor working capital purposes. We determined that we held variable interests in SciVac based on our assessment that SciVac did not have sufficient resources to carry out its principal activities without financial support. We had also determined we were the primary beneficiary of SciVac through our representation on SciVacs board of directors. SciVacs board of directors consisted of 5members, of which 3members had been appointed by us, representing 60%of SciVacs board. As a result of this conclusion, we consolidated the results of operations and financial position of SciVac through June 2015 and recorded a reduction of equity for the portion of SciVac we do not own.On July 9, 2015, SciVac Therapeutics Inc., formerly Levon Resources Ltd. STI completed a reverse takeover transaction the Arrangement pursuant to which STI acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of SciVac. As a result of this transaction, OPKOs ownership in STI decreased to 245%. 92Table of ContentsUpon completion of the Arrangement, we determined that STI was not a VIE. We also determined that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of STI that would require us to consolidate STI. STIs board of directors consists of 7members, of which 3independent members are initially members of our management. We do not have any rights to appoint members to STIs board. STIs board members are approved by a vote of the shareholders. We recorded a $159 milliongain on the deconsolidation of SciVac in Other income expense, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The recognized gain was primarily due to the fair value of the retained interest in STI based on Levons cash contribution of approximately $212 millionunder the Arrangement. Following the deconsolidation, we account for our investment in STI under the equity method as we have determined that we and/or our related parties can significantly influence STI through our board representation and voting power. STI is considered a related party as a result of our board representation in STI and executive managements ownership interests in STI. In October 2015, STI announced it entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of STI will merge with and into VBI Vaccines Inc.

The Purchasers of the 2033 Senior Notes include Frost Gamma Investments Trust, a trust affiliated with Dr.Frost, and Hsu Gamma Investment, L.P., an entity affiliated with Dr.Jane H. Hsiao, our Vice Chairman and Chief Technology Officer. The 2033 Senior Notes were issued on January30, 2013. The 2033 Senior Notes, which totaled $1750 million, bear interest at the rate of 300%per year, payable semiannually on February1 and August1 of each year, beginning August1, 2013. The 2033 Senior Notes will mature on February1, 2033, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Upon a fundamental change as defined in the instruments governing the 2033 Senior Notes, subject to certain exceptions, the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their 2033 Senior Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100%of the principal amount of the 2033 Senior Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the fundamental change repurchase date.The following table sets forth information related to the 2033 Senior Notes which is included our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015:In thousandsEmbedded conversion option2033 Senior NotesDiscountTotalBalance at December 31,  of debt discount2,6132,613Change in fair value of embedded  at December 31,  following table sets forth information related to the 2033 Senior Notes which is included our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014:In thousandsEmbedded conversion option2033 Senior NotesDiscountTotalBalance at December 31,  of debt discount5,6625,662Change in fair value of embedded  at December 31,  2033 Senior Notes will be convertible at any time on or after November1, 2032, through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, at the option of the holders. Additionally, holders may convert their 2033 Senior Notes prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding November1, 2032, under the following circumstances: 1conversion based upon satisfaction of the trading price condition relating to the 2033 Senior Notes; 2conversion based on the Common Stock price; 3conversion based upon the occurrence of specified corporate events; or 4if we call the 2033 Senior Notes for redemption. The 2033 Senior Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our Common Stock, or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, at our election unless we have made an irrevocable election of net share settlement. The initial conversion rate for the 2033 Senior Notes will be 14148shares of Common Stock per $1,000principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $707per share of Common Stock, and will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for holders who convert their 2033 Senior Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the Indenture and holders who convert upon the occurrence of certain specific events prior to February1, 2017 other than in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. Holders of the 2033 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the 2033 Senior Notes for 100%of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on February1, 2019, February 1, 2023 and February 1, 2028, or following the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the 2033 Senior Notes. See further discussion in Note 20.We may not redeem the 2033 Senior Notes prior to February1, 2017. On or after February1, 2017 and before February1, 2019, we may redeem for cash any or all of the 2033 Senior Notes but only if the last reported sale price of our Common Stock exceeds 130%of the applicable conversion price for at least 20trading days during the 30consecutive trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which we deliver the redemption notice. The redemption 97Table of Contentsprice will equal 100%of the principal amount of the 2033 Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date. On or after February1, 2019, we may redeem for cash any or all of the 2033 Senior Notes at a redemption price of 100%of the principal amount of the 2033 Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but not including the redemption date.The terms of the 2033 Senior Notes, include, among others: i rights to convert into shares of our Common Stock, including upon a fundamental change; and ii a coupon make-whole payment in the event of a conversion by the holders of the 2033 Senior Notes on or after February 1, 2017 but prior to February 1, 2019. We have determined that these specific terms are considered to be embedded derivatives. Embedded derivatives are required to be separated from the host contract, the 2033 Senior Notes, and carried at fair value when: a the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and b a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument. We have concluded that the embedded derivatives within the 2033 Senior Notes meet these criteria and, as such, must be valued separate and apart from the 2033 Senior Notes and recorded at fair value each reporting period.For accounting and financial reporting purposes, we combine these embedded derivatives and value them together as one unit of accounting. At each reporting period, we record these embedded derivatives at fair value which is included as a component of the 2033 Senior Notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.On August 30, 2013, oneof the conversion rights in the 2033 Senior Notes was triggered. Holders of the 2033 Senior Notes converted $169 millionprincipal amount into 2,396,145shares of our Common Stock at a rate of 14148shares of Common Stock per $1,000principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes. We recorded a $10 millionnon-cash gain related to the conversion. The gain on exchange is included within Other income expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In June 2014, we entered into an exchange agreement with a holder of the Companys 2033 Senior Notes pursuant to which such holder exchanged $704 millionin aggregate principal amount of Notes for 10,974,431shares of the Companys Common Stock and approximately $08 millionin cash representing accrued interest through the date of completion of the exchange. We recorded a $27 millionnon-cash gain related to the exchange. On April 1, 2015, we announced that our 2033 Senior Notes are convertible by holders of such notes. We have elected to satisfy our conversion obligation under the 2033 Senior Notes in shares of our Common Stock. This conversion right was triggered because the closing price per share of our Common Stock has exceeded $919, or 130%of the initial conversion price of $707, for at least 3of 30consecutive trading days during the period ending on March 31, 2015. The 2033 Senior Notes were convertible until June 30, 2015, and may be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the Indenture, dated as of January 30, 2013, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank N.A., is satisfied during future measurement periods. Pursuant to the Indenture, a holder who elects to convert the 2033 Senior Notes will receive 1414827shares of our Common Stock plus such number of additional shares as is applicable on the conversion date per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes based on the early conversion provisions in the Indenture. On July 1, 2015, October 1, 2015 and January 5, 2016, we announced that our 2033 Senior Notes continue to be convertible by holders of such notes during the third quarter of 2015, the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively.During 2015, pursuant to the conversion right or through exchange agreements we entered with certain holders of our 2033 Senior Notes, holders of our 2033 Senior Notes converted or exchanged $554 millionin aggregate principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes for 8,118,062shares of the Companys Common Stock. We recorded a $09 millionnon-cash gain related to the conversion and exchanges. The gain is included within Other income expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.We used a binomial lattice model in order to estimate the fair value of the embedded derivative in the 2033 Senior Notes. A binomial lattice model generates two probable outcomes one up and another down arising at each point in time, starting from the date of valuation until the maturity date. A lattice model was initially used to determine if the 2033 Senior Notes would be converted, called or held at each decision point. Within the lattice model, the following assumptions are made: i the 2033 Senior Notes will be converted early if the conversion value is greater than the holding value; or ii the 2033 Senior Notes will be called if the holding value is greater than both a the redemption price as defined in the Indenture and b the conversion value plus the coupon make-whole payment at the time. If the 2033 Senior Notes are called, then the holder will maximize their value by finding the optimal decision between 1 redeeming at the redemption price and 2 converting the 2033 Senior Notes.Using this lattice model, we valued the embedded derivatives using the with-and-without method, where the value of the 2033 Senior Notes including the embedded derivatives is defined as the with, and the value of the 2033 Senior Notes excluding the embedded derivatives is defined as the without. This method estimates the value of the embedded derivatives 98Table of Contentsby looking at the difference in the values between the 2033 Senior Notes with the embedded derivatives and the value of the 2033 Senior Notes without the embedded derivatives.The lattice model requires the following inputs: i price of our Common Stock; ii Conversion Rate as defined in the Indenture; iii Conversion Price as defined in the Indenture; iv maturity date; v risk-free interest rate; vi estimated stock volatility; and vii estimated credit spread for the Company.The following table sets forth the inputs to the lattice model used to value the embedded derivative:December31, 2015December 31, 2014December 31, 2013Stock   Price$707$707$707Maturity dateFebruary1, 2033February1, 2033February1, 2033Risk-free interest rate133%140%178%Estimated stock volatility50%39%55%Estimated credit spread1,142 basis points1,081 basis points828 basis pointsThe following table sets forth the fair value of the 2033 Senior Notes with and without the embedded derivatives, and the fair value of the embedded derivatives at December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

For example, a decrease in our estimated credit spread results in an increase in the estimated value of the embedded derivatives. Conversely, a decrease in the price of our Common Stock results in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives. For the years ended December 31,2015and 2014, we observed an increase in the market price of our Common Stock which primarily resulted in a $366 millionand $122 millionincrease, respectively, in the estimated fair value of our embedded derivatives recorded in Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.On November 5, 2015, Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. CB, as lender and administrative agent the Credit Agreement, which replaced Bio-References existing credit facility with PNC Bank, National Association PNC. The Credit Agreement provides for a $1750 millionsecured revolving credit facility and includes a $200 millionsub-facility for swingline loans and a $200 millionsub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Bio-Reference may increase the credit facility to up to $2750 millionon a secured basis, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. The Credit Agreement matures on November 5, 2020 and is guaranteed by all of Bio-References domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement is also secured by substantially all assets of Bio-Reference and its domestic subsidiaries, as well as a non-recourse pledge by us of our equity interest in Bio-Reference. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivables of Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries, as specified therein. The proceeds of the new credit facility were used to refinance existing indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under the credit facility with PNC which was terminated in 2015 in accordance with its terms, to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes of Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries.At Bio-References option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement other than swingline loans will bear interest at i the CB floating rate defined as the higher of a the prime rate and b the LIBOR rate adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities for an interest period of one month plus 250% plus an applicable margin of 035%for the first 12 months and 050%thereafter or ii the LIBOR rate adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for Eurocurrency liabilities plus an applicable margin of 135%for the first 12 months and 150%thereafter. Swingline loans will bear interest at the CB floating rate plus the applicable margin. The Credit Agreement also calls for other customary fees and charges, including an unused commitment fee of 025%of the lending commitments. 99Table of ContentsThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants and restrictions, including, without limitation, covenants that require Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if availability under the new credit facility falls below a specified amount and to comply with laws, and restrictions on the ability of Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or to pay dividends and make certain other distributions to the Company, subject to certain exceptions as specified therein. Failure to comply with these covenants would constitute an event of default under the Credit Agreement, notwithstanding the ability of Bio-Reference to meet its debt service obligations. The Credit Agreement also includes various customary remedies for the lenders following an event of default, including the acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement and execution upon the collateral securing obligations under the Credit Agreement. Substantially all the assets of Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries are restricted from sale, transfer, lease, disposal or distributions to the Company, subject to certain exceptions. Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries net assets as of December31, 2015was approximately $10 billion, which includes goodwill of $4412 millionand intangible assets of $5283 million.We have line of credit agreements with tenfinancial institutions as of December31, 2015and tenfinancial institutions as of December31, 2014in United States, Chile and Spain.

Equity awards granted under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan are exercisable for a period of either 7years or 10years from the date of grant. Equity awards granted under our 2000 Stock Option Plan, 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and the two Modigene Plans are exercisable for a period of up to 10years from date of grant. Vesting periods range from immediate to 5years. We classify the cash flows resulting from the tax benefit that arises when the tax deductions exceed the compensation cost recognized for those equity awards excess tax benefits as financing cash inflows. There were noexcess tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.Equity-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of equity-based compensation to non-employees is subject to periodic adjustment over the vesting period of the equity instruments.Valuation and Expense InformationWe recorded equity-based compensation expense of $261 million, $148 millionand $110 millionfor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, all of which were reflected as operating expenses. Of the $261 millionof equity based compensation expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2015, $174 millionwas recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses, $79 millionwas recorded as research and development expenses and $08 millionwas recorded as a cost of revenue. Of the $148 millionof equity based compensation expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2014, $97 millionwas recorded as selling, general and administrative expense and $50 millionwas recorded as research and development expenses and $01 millionwas recorded as a cost of revenue. Of the $110 millionof equity based compensation expense recorded in the year ended December 31, 2013, $73 millionwas recorded as selling, general and administrative expense and $36 millionwas recorded as research and development expenses. We estimate forfeitures of stock options and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are determined for all employees and non-employee directors based on historical experience and our estimate of future vesting. Estimated forfeiture rates are adjusted from time to time based on actual forfeiture experience.As of December 31, 2015, there was $908 millionof unrecognized compensation cost related to the stock options granted under our equity-based incentive compensation plans. Such cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 30 years.Stock OptionsWe estimate the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton Model option-pricing formula and amortize the fair value to expense over the stock options vesting period using the straight-line attribution approach for employees and non-employee directors, and for awards issued to non-employees we recognize compensation expense on a graded basis, with most of the compensation expense being recorded during the initial periods of vesting. We apply the following assumptions in our Black-Scholes-Merton Model option-pricing formula:Year EndedDecember31,2015Year EndedDecember31,2014Year EndedDecember31,2013Expected term in  interest rate026% - 242%010% - 265%015% - 245%Expected volatility'32% - 64%'31% - 72%'31% - 83%Expected dividend yield0%0%0%Expected Term: The expected term of the stock options granted to employees and non-employee directors was calculated using the shortcut method. We believe this method is appropriate as our equity shares have been publicly-traded for a limited period of time and as such we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The expected term of stock options issued to non-employee consultants is the remaining contractual life of the options issued103Table of ContentsRisk-Free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option.Expected Volatility: The expected volatility for stock options with an expected life of 8 yearsor less was based on the historical volatility of our stock. The expected volatility for stock options with an expected life of 9 yearsor greater was based on an average of the volatility of a peer group of publicly-traded entities and the historical volatility of our stock, which we believe will be representative of the volatility over the expected term of the options. We believe the use of peer groups historical volatility is appropriate as our equity shares have not been publicly-traded for 9 years.Expected Dividend Yield: We do not intend to pay dividends on Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we used a dividend yield of zero in the assumptions.We maintain incentive stock plans that provide for the grants of stock options to our directors, officers, employees and non-employee consultants. As of December 31, 2015, there were 2,056,783shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under our 2007 Incentive Plan. We intend to issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options. Stock options granted under these plans have been granted at an option price equal to the closing market value of the stock on the date of the grant. Stock options granted under these plans to employees typically become exercisable over four years in equal annual installments after the date of grant, and stock options granted to non-employee directors become exercisable in full one-year after the grant date, subject to, in each case, continuous service with us during the applicable vesting period. We assumed stock options to grant Common Stock as part of the mergers with Acuity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Froptix, Inc., OPKO Biologics and Bio-Reference, which reflected various vesting schedules, including monthly vesting to employees and non-employee consultants.A summary of option activity under our stock option plans as of December 31, 2015, and the changes during the year is presented below:OptionsNumber  at December31,  at December31,  and expected to vest at December31,  at December31,  total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013was $699 million, $146 millionand $595 million, respectively.The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013was $500, $464, and $4, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013was $133 million, $109 millionand $59 million, respectively.Restricted StockIn 2009, we issued 30,000shares of restricted Common Stock to one of our independent board members. The restricted stock was granted under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan with a term of 7years and vesting occurring 5years after the grant date with certain events which would accelerate the vesting of the award. The restricted stock was valued using the grant date fair value which was equivalent to the closing price of our Common Stock on the grant date. We record the cost of restricted stock over the vesting period104Table of ContentsNote 10 Income TaxesWe operate and are required to file tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.The benefit provision for incomes taxes consists of the    income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2015and 2014are comprised of the following:In thousandsDecember 31, 2015December 31, 2014Deferred income tax assets:Federal net operating loss$71,658$63,004State net operating loss14,22712,050Foreign net operating loss33,70125,825Research and development expense5,1389,244Research and development tax credit7,3886,077Stock  investments4,4208,038Bad debts38,809Lease  income tax assets221,309149,126Deferred income tax liabilities:Intangible assets386,588177,074Fixed  income tax  deferred income tax  allowance42,147131,931Net deferred income tax  changes in deferred income tax assets, liabilities and valuation allowances at December 31, 2015reflect the acquisition of various legal entities, including the tax attributes. The acquisitions were accounted for under U.S. GAAP as stock acquisitions and business combinations. As of December 31, 2015, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3624 million, $1999 millionand $1266 million, respectively, that expire at various dates through 2035. Included in the foreign net operating losses is $1129 millionrelated to OPKO Biologics. As of December 31, 2015, we have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $74 millionthat expire in varying amounts 105Table of Contentsthrough 2035. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As a result of the merger with Bio-Reference, OPKO released the full valuation allowance recorded against OPKOs U.S. deferred tax assets, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $934 million. As a result of certain realization requirements of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities shown above does not include certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, that arose directly from or the use of which was postponed by tax deductions related to equity compensation that are greater than the compensation recognized for financial reporting. Equity will be increased by $339million if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized. The Company uses ASC 740 ordering when determining when excess tax benefits have been realized.Under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, certain significant changes in ownership may restrict the future utilization of our income tax loss carryforwards and income tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. The annual limitation is equal to the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate i.e., the highest of the adjusted Federal long-term rates in effect for any month in the three-calendar-month period ending with the calendar month in which the change date occurs. This limitation may be increased under the IRC 338 Approach IRS approved methodology for determining recognized Built-In Gain. As a result, federal net operating losses and tax credits may expire before we are able to fully utilize them.During 2008, we conducted a study to determine the impact of the various ownership changes that occurred during 2007 and 2008. As a result, we have concluded that the annual utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and tax credits is subject to a limitation pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 382. Under the tax law, such NOLs and tax credits are subject to expiration from 15to 20years after they were generated. As a result of the annual limitation that may be imposed on such tax attributes and the statutory expiration period, some of these tax attributes may expire prior to our being able to use them. There is no current impact on these financial statements as a result of the annual limitation. This study did not conclude as to whether eXegenics pre-merger NOLs were limited under Section382. As such, of the $3624 millionof federal net operating loss carryforwards, at least approximately $509 millionmay not be able to be utilized.Uncertain Income Tax PositionsWe file federal income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, as well as with various U.S. states and the Ontario and Quebec provinces in Canada. We are subject to routine tax audits in all jurisdictions for which we file tax returns. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. It is reasonably possible that some audits will close within the next twelve months, which we do not believe would result in a material change to our accrued uncertain tax positions. Additionally, included in income tax expense is an accrual of $23 millionrelated to uncertain tax positions involving income recognition from the Pfizer Transaction. We recognize that local tax law is inherently complex and the local taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions taken. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that ultimate resolution of these matters in any jurisdiction may be significantly more or less than estimated. We evaluated the estimated tax exposure for a range of current likely outcomes to be from $0to approximately $500 millionand recorded our accrual to reflect our best expectation of ultimate resolution. U.S. Federal: Under the tax statute of limitations applicable to the Internal Revenue Code, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2012. However, because we are carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2012 and earlier tax years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future.State: Under the statutes of limitation applicable to most state income tax laws, we are no longer subject to state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012 in states in which we have filed income tax returns. Certain states may take the position that we are subject to income tax in such states even though we have not filed income tax returns in such states and, depending on the varying state income tax statutes and administrative practices, the statute of limitations in such states may extend to years before 2012.Foreign: Under the statutes of limitations applicable to our foreign operations, we are generally no longer subject to tax examination for years before 2010 in jurisdictions where we have filed income tax returns106Table of ContentsUnrecognized Tax BenefitsAs of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $86 million, $59 million, and $92 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the total gross unrecognized tax benefit of $86 millionconsisted of increases of $35 millionas a result of current year activity, and decreases of $08 millionas a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations. As of December 31, 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate was $07 million. We account for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2014and 2013, $09 millionand $02 millionof the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would have affected our effective income tax rate. We believe it is reasonably possible that approximately $01 millionof unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized within the next twelvemonths.The following summarizes the changes in our gross unrecognized income tax benefits.

Dr. Hsiao and Mr. Rubin were also directors and less than 5%stockholders of PROLOR. In January 2013, we sold $1750 millionaggregate principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. The Purchasers of the 2033 Senior Notes include the Gamma Trust and Hsu Gamma. The 2033 Senior Notes were issued on January30, 2013.During the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, FineTech recorded revenue of $03 millionand $03 million, respectively, for the sale of APIs to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Limited Teva.

Effective May 28, 2015, we entered into an amendment to our lease agreement with Frost Holdings. The lease, as amended, is for approximately 25,000square feet of space. The lease provides for payments of approximately $66 thousandper month in the first year increasing annually to $75 thousandper month in the fifth year, plus applicable sales taxes. The rent is inclusive of operating expenses, property taxes and parking. The rent was reduced by $216 thousandfor the cost of tenant improvements.Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bio-Reference purchases and uses certain products acquired from InCellDx, Inc., a company in which we hold a 27%minority interest in.We reimburse Dr.Frost for Company-related use by Dr.Frost and our other executives of an airplane owned by a company that is beneficially owned by Dr.Frost.

As a result, as of December 31, 2015, we recorded $544 millionas contingent consideration, with $222 millionrecorded within Accrued expenses and $323 millionrecorded within Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we satisfied a $200 millioncontingent payment to the former owners of OPKO Renal through the issuance of 1,194,337shares of our common stock in the third quarter of 2015.In July 2012, OPKO Lab received a letter from AdvanceMed Corporation AdvanceMed regarding a post-payment review conducted by AdvanceMed the Post-Payment Review Letter. The Post-Payment Review Letter originated with a post payment review audit by AdvanceMed of 183claims submitted by OPKO Lab to the Medicare program. OPKO Lab believes that its billing practices were appropriate and it is following the appeal process set forth by Medicare. OPKO Lab received a partially favorable determination, which reduced the amount of the alleged overpayment, and it continues to appeal the remaining alleged overpayments. No assurances can be given about the outcome of the appeal.On or around October 21, 2014, we received a Civil Investigative Demand Demand from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Tennessee Attorneys Office. The Demand concerns an investigation of allegations that the Company or one of its affiliated entities or other parties submitted false claims for payment related to services provided to government healthcare program beneficiaries in violation of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 3729. We are fully cooperating with the investigation and are producing documents responsive to the Demand. It is too early to assess the range of loss, if any.Following the announcement of entry into an agreement and plan of merger with Bio-Reference, four putative class action complaints challenging the merger were filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey in Bergen County the Court. The parties executed a stipulated consent order that the actions would be consolidated for all purposes, including trial, in the Chancery Division under Docket No. C-207-15, bearing the caption In re Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. Shareholder Litigation the Consolidated Action. The complaints name Bio-Reference, OPKO, a wholly-owned merger subsidiary of OPKO Merger Sub and members of the Bio-Reference board as defendants. The complaints generally allege, among other things, that members of the Bio-Reference board breached their fiduciary duties to Bio-References shareholders by agreeing to sell Bio-Reference for an inadequate price and agreeing to inappropriate deal protection provisions in the merger agreement that may preclude Bio-Reference from soliciting any potential acquirers and limit the ability of the Bio-Reference board to act with respect to investigating and pursuing superior proposals and alternatives. In August, the parties executed a memorandum of understanding reflecting terms of a settlement, which was replaced in September 2015 by a stipulation and agreement of compromise, settlement and release resolving all matters between them. In January 2016, the Court entered an order finally 109Table of Contentsapproving the settlement.The settlement did not have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Under a license agreement one of our subsidiaries has with Washington University in St. Louis, we are obligated to pay Washington University a single digit percentage of any sublicensing payment we receive in connection with a sublicense of our rights to Washington University patents subject to certain exceptions. In connection with the Pfizer Transaction, we sublicensed to Pfizer the sole remaining patent licensed to us by Washington University and paid to Washington University the sublicensing payment we believe is due under the license agreement. Washington University has questioned the computation of the sublicense payment and has notified us that it would like to review additional information relating to the sublicense and the Pfizer Transaction to determine whether additional amounts are owed to it. We accrue a liability for legal contingencies when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss. We review these accruals and adjust them to reflect ongoing negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other relevant information. To the extent new information is obtained and our views on the probable outcomes of claims, suits, assessments, investigations or legal proceedings change, changes in our accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. For the matters referenced in the paragraph below, the amount of liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated; and, therefore, accruals have not been made. In addition, in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance, for matters which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible, we provide disclosure of the possible loss or range of loss; however, if a reasonable estimate cannot be made, we will provide disclosure to that effect.We are a party to other litigation in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that any such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We expect to incur substantial losses as we continue the development of our product candidates, continue our other research and development activities, and establish a pharmaceutical sales and marketing infrastructure in anticipation of the commercialization of our pharmaceutical product candidates. We currently have limited pharmaceutical commercialization capabilities, and it is possible that we may never successfully commercialize any of our diagnostic and pharmaceutical product candidates. We do not currently generate significant revenue from any of our diagnostic and pharmaceutical product candidates. Our research and development activities are budgeted to expand over a period of time and will require further resources if we are to be successful. As a result, we believe that our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years. We may need to obtain additional funds to further develop our research and development programs, and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.We have employment agreements with certain executives which provide for compensation and certain other benefits and for severance payments under certain circumstances.At December 31, 2015, we were committed to make future purchases for inventory and other items in 2016 that occur in the ordinary course of business under various purchase arrangements with fixed purchase provisions aggregating $483 million. Note 14 Strategic AlliancesPfizer Inc.We plan to develop a portfolio of product candidates through a combination of internal development and external partnerships. In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with Pfizer Inc. Pfizer for the development and commercialization of our long-acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born small for gestational age SGA the Pfizer Transaction.The Pfizer Transaction closed in January 2015 following the termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Under the terms of the Pfizer Transaction, we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $2950 millionand are eligible to receive up to an additional $2750 millionupon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Pfizer received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. In addition, we are eligible to receive initial tiered royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD with percentage rates ranging from the high teens to mid-twenties. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD in certain major markets, the royalties will transition to regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and Pfizers Genotropin110Table of ContentsThe agreement with Pfizer will remain in effect until the last sale of the licensed product, unless earlier terminated as permitted under the agreement. In addition to termination rights for material breach and bankruptcy, Pfizer is permitted to terminate the Agreement in its entirety, or with respect to one or more world regions, without cause after a specified notice period. If the Agreement is terminated by us for Pfizers uncured material breach, or by Pfizer without cause, provision has been made for transition of product and product responsibilities to us for the terminated regions, as well as continued supply of product by Pfizer or transfer of supply to us in order to support the terminated regions. We will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which includes Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. Pfizer will be responsible for all development costs for additional indications as well as all post-marketing studies. In addition, Pfizer will fund the commercialization activities for all indications and lead the manufacturing activities covered by the global development plan.For revenue recognition purposes, we viewed the Pfizer Transaction as a multiple-element arrangement. Multiple-element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the various performance obligations, or elements, can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. We evaluated whether a delivered element under an arrangement has standalone value and qualifies for treatment as a separate unit of accounting. Deliverables that do not meet these criteria are not evaluated separately for the purpose of revenue recognition. For a single unit of accounting, payments received are recognized in a manner consistent with the final deliverable. We determined that the deliverables under the Pfizer Transaction, including the licenses granted to Pfizer, as well as our obligations to provide various research and development services, will be accounted for as a single unit of account. This determination was made because the ongoing research and development services to be provided by us are essential to the overall arrangement as we have significant knowledge and technical know-how that is important to realizing the value of the licenses granted. The performance period over which the revenue will be recognized is expected to continue from the first quarter of 2015 through 2019, when we anticipate completing the various research and development services that are specified in the Pfizer Transaction and our performance obligations are completed. We will continue to review the timing of when our research and development services will be completed in order to assess that the estimated performance period over which the revenue is to be recognized is appropriate. Any significant changes in the timing of the performance period will result in a change in the revenue recognition period.We are recognizing the non-refundable $2950 millionupfront payments on a straight-line basis over the performance period. We recognized $655 millionof revenue related to the Pfizer Transaction in Revenue from transfer of intellectual property in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2015, and had deferred revenue related to the Pfizer Transaction of $2295 millionat December31, 2015. As of December31, 2015, $706 millionof deferred revenue related to the Pfizer Transaction was classified in Accrued expenses and $1589 millionwas classified in Other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $553 millionin research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP.The Pfizer Transaction includes milestone payments of $2750 millionupon the achievement of certain milestones. The milestones range from $200 millionto $900 millioneach and are based on achievement of regulatory approval in the U.S. and regulatory approval and price approval in other major markets. We evaluated each of these milestone payments and believe that all of the milestones are substantive as i there is substantive uncertainty at the close of the Pfizer Transaction that the milestones would be achieved as approval from a regulatory authority must be received to achieve the milestones which would be commensurate with the enhancement of value of the underlying intellectual property, ii the milestones relate solely to past performance and iii the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended and the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone. The milestone payments will be recognized as revenue in full in the period in which the associated milestone is achieved, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. To date, no revenue has been recognized related to the achievement of the milestones.In the first quarter of 2015, we made a payment of $259 millionto the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy OCS in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel. We recognized the $259 millionpayment in Grant repayment expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations during the year ended December 31, 2015.TESAROIn November 2009, we entered into an asset purchase agreement the NK-1 Agreement under which we acquired VARUBI rolapitant and other neurokinin-1 NK-1 assets from Merck. In December 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with TESARO, in which we out-licensed the development, manufacture, commercialization and distribution of our lead NK-1 candidate, VARUBI the TESARO License. Under the terms of the license, we received a $60 millionupfront payment from TESARO and are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $300 millionupon achievement of 111Table of Contentscertain regulatory and commercial sale milestones of which $200 millionhas been received to date and additional commercial milestone payments of up to $850 millionif specified levels of annual net sales are achieved. During the years ended December 31,2015and 2014, $150 millionand $50 millionof revenue, respectively, has been recognized related to the achievement of the milestones under the TESARO License. TESARO is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties on annual net sales achieved in the United States and Europe at percentage rates that range from the low double digits to the low twenties, and outside of the United States and Europe at low double-digit percentage rates. TESARO assumed responsibility for clinical development and commercialization of licensed products at its expense. Under the Agreement, we will continue to receive royalties on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of the date that all of the patent rights licensed from us and covering VARUBI expire, are invalidated or are not enforceable and 12years from the first commercial sale of the product.If TESARO elects to develop and commercialize VARUBI in Japan through a third-party licensee, TESARO will share equally with us all amounts it receives in connection with such activities, subject to certain exceptions and deductions. In addition, we will have an option to market the products in Latin America. The term of the license will remain in force until the expiration of the royalty term in each country, unless we terminate the license earlier for TESAROs material breach of the license or bankruptcy. TESARO has a right to terminate the license at any time during the term for any reason on three months written notice.TESAROs New Drug Application NDA for approval of oral VARUBI, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist in development for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, was approved by the U.S. FDA in September 2015, and in November 2015, TESARO announced the commercial launch of VARUBI in the United States. Under the terms of the NK-1 Agreement, upon approval by the FDA of the TESAROs NDA for oral VARUBI, we were required to pay Merck a $50 millionmilestone payment. In addition, $50 millionwill be due and payable each year thereafter for the next four 4 years on the anniversary date of the NDA approval. We recognized the present value of the milestone payments on FDA approval of $230 millionas an intangible asset which will be amortized to expense over the expected useful life of the asset, which is approximately 13years. The present value of the future payments to Merck of $182 millionat December31, 2015is recorded as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet with $50 millionin Accrued expenses and $132 millionin Other long-term liabilities.Pharmsynthez In April 2013, we entered into a series of concurrent transactions with Pharmsynthez, a Russian pharmaceutical company traded on the Moscow Stock Exchange pursuant to which we acquired an equity method investment in Pharmsynthez ownership 17%. We also granted rights to certain technologies in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan the Territories to Pharmsynthez and agreed to perform certain development activities. We will receive from Pharmsynthez royalties on net sales of products incorporating the technologies in the Territories, as well as a percentage of any sublicense income from third parties for the technologies in the Territories. In July 2015, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Pharmsynthez pursuant to which we delivered $30 millionto Pharmsynthez in exchange for a $30 millionnote the Pharmsynthez Note Receivable.

In accounting for the sale of the RNAi Assets, we determined that we did not have any continuing involvement in the development of the RNAi Assets or any other future performance obligations and, as a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $125million of Revenue from transfer of intellectual property in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, RXi will be required to pay us up to $500 millionin milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of each drug developed by RXi, certain of its affiliates or any of its or their licensees or sublicensees utilizing patents included within the RNAi Assets each, a Qualified Drug. In addition, RXi will also be required to pay us royalties equal to: aa mid single-digit percentage of Net Sales as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement with respect to each Qualified Drug sold for an ophthalmologic use during the applicable Royalty Period as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement; and ba low single-digit percentage of net sales with respect to each Qualified Drug sold for a non-ophthalmologic use during the applicable royalty period112Table of ContentsOtherWe have completed strategic deals with UT Southwestern, Washington University, INEOS Healthcare, TSRI, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, and Academia Sinica, among others. In connection with these agreements, upon the achievement of certain milestones we are obligated to make certain payments and have royalty obligations upon sales of products developed under the license agreements. At this time, we are unable to estimate the timing and amounts of payments as the obligations are based on future development of the licensed products113Table of ContentsNote 15 LeasesOperating LeasesWe conduct certain of our operations under operating lease agreements.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We utilize a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.A summary of our investments classified as available for sale and carried at fair value, is as follows:As of December 31, 2015In    stock investments, available for   of ContentsAs of December 31, 2014In    stock investments, available for   future fluctuation in fair value related to our available for sale investments that is judged to be temporary, and any recoveries of previous write-downs, will be recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. If we determine that any future valuation adjustment was other-than-temporary, we will record a loss during the period such determination is made. Any future changes in the fair value of option and warrant instruments will be recorded in Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.As of December31, 2015, we have money market funds that qualify as cash equivalents, forward foreign currency exchange contracts for inventory purchases Refer to Note 18 and contingent consideration related to the acquisitions of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe, and OPKO Renal that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

We use the following methods and assumptions in estimating fair value:Contingent consideration We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration utilizing a discounted cash flow model for the expected payments based on estimated timing and expected revenues. We use several discount rates depending on each type of contingent consideration related to OPKO Diagnostics, CURNA, OPKO Health Europe, OPKO Renal and Merck VARUBI transactions. If estimated future sales were to decrease by 10%, the contingent consideration related to OPKO Renal would decrease by $17 million. As of December31, 2015, of the $544 millionof contingent consideration, $222 millionis recorded in Accrued expenses and $323 millionis recorded in Other long-term liabilities. As of December31, 2014, of the $716 millionof contingent consideration, $274 millionis recorded in Accrued expenses and $442 millionis recorded in Other long-term liabilities.Deferred payments We estimate the fair value of the deferred payments utilizing a discounted cash flow model for the expected payments.Embedded conversion option We estimate the fair value of the embedded conversion option related to the 2033 Senior Notes using a binomial lattice model. Refer to Note 6 for detail description of the binomial lattice model and the fair value assumptions used.Note 18 Derivative Contracts120Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the fair values and the presentation of our derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:In thousandsBalance Sheet ComponentDecember31, 2015December31, 2014Derivative financial instruments:Common stock options/warrantsInvestments, net$5,338$6,314Embedded conversion option2033 Senior Notes, net of discount and estimated fair value of embedded  contracts Unrealized gains on forward contracts are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. Unrealized losses on forward contracts are recorded in Accrued expenses.$9$36We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to cover the risk of exposure to exchange rate differences arising from inventory purchases on letters of credit. Under these forward contracts, for any rate above or below the fixed rate, we receive or pay the difference between the spot rate and the fixed rate for the given amount at the settlement date.To qualify the derivative instrument as a hedge, we are required to meet strict hedge effectiveness and contemporaneous documentation requirements at the initiation of the hedge and assess the hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis over the life of the hedge. At December31, 2015and 2014, our derivative financial instruments do not meet the documentation requirements to be designated as hedges. Accordingly, we recognize the changes in Fair value of derivative instruments, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We have elected to satisfy our conversion obligation under the 2033 Senior Notes in shares of our Common Stock. This conversion right has been triggered because the closing price per share of our Common Stock has exceeded $919, or 130%of the initial conversion price of $707, for at least 20of 30consecutive trading days during the period ending on December31, 2015. The conversion right was previously triggered during the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015. The 2033 Senior Notes will continue to be convertible until March 31, 2016, and may be convertible thereafter, if oneor more of the conversion conditions specified in the Indenture, dated as of January 30, 2013, by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank N.A., is satisfied during future measurement periods. Pursuant to the Indenture, a holder who elects to convert the 2033 Senior Notes will receive 1414827shares of our Common Stock plus such number of additional shares as is applicable on the conversion date per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes based on the early conversion provisions in the Indenture.We have reviewed all subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the date of our December 31, 2015Consolidated Balance Sheet date, through the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K122Table of ContentsItem 1.Business5Item!1A.Risk Factors22Item1B.Unresolved Staff  Proceedings50Item!4.Mine Safety Disclosures51Part II.Item5.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESDisclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act as of December31, 2015. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2015. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined effective could provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on the framework in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our evaluation under the framework in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2015. As permitted, our managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of EirGen Pharma Limited EirGen or Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc. Bio-Reference, because they were acquired by us in business combinations in May 2015 and August 2015, respectively. EirGen and Bio-References assets excluded from the annual assessment process were 15%of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2015and 68%of consolidated revenues for the year then ended as a result of the closing of the acquisitions in May 2015 and August 2015.The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, who also audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as stated in their report which appears with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.Changes to the Companys Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In connection with the acquisitions of EirGen in May 2015 and Bio-Reference in August 2015, we began implementing standards and procedures at EirGen and Bio-Reference, including establishing controls over accounting systems and establishing controls over the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to ensure that we have in place appropriate internal control over financial reporting at EirGen and Bio-Reference. We are continuing to integrate the acquired operations of EirGen and Bio-Reference into our overall internal control over financial reporting process.These changes to the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter ended December31, 2015have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting123Table of Contents
