REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Stoneridge, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stoneridge, Inc. an Ohio Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002
and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8.
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements and
schedule of Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and for the year then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations and whose report dated January 22, 2002, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements and schedule before the restatement adjustments and disclosures described below and in Notes 2, 8 and 12.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, under the prospective transition method in Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure; an Amendment to Statement No. 123. Also explained in Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of Stoneridge, Inc.
and Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. However, the Company made certain adjustments to and disclosures in the prior years financial statements to conform to the current
years presentation or to comply with adoption requirements of new accounting pronouncements, as follows:  i As described in Note 2, the 2001 consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement No.
142, which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the 2001 disclosures in Note 2 included a agreeing the previously reported net income in total and the related net income per share amounts to the
previously issued consolidated financial statements and the adjustments to reported amounts representing amortization expense including any related tax effects recognized in those periods related to goodwill as a result of initially applying
Statement No. 142 to the Companys underlying records obtained from management, and b testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported net income, and the related net income per share amounts.
ii In Note 8, the Company added 2001 disclosures relating to
its defined benefit pension plan to conform to the 2002 presentation. We audited the information added for the 2001 disclosures. Our procedures included a agreeing the 2001 defined benefit pension plan amounts and information contained in Note 8
to the Companys underlying records obtained from management, and b testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliations of 2001 defined benefit pension plan amounts to the consolidated financial statements. 
18 Table of Contents
iii As presented in Note 12, the Company changed the composition of its reportable segments in 2002
from one reportable segment to two reportable segments, and the amounts in the 2001 consolidated financial statements relating to reportable segments have been restated to conform to the 2002 composition of reportable segments. We audited the
adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for reportable segments reflected in the 2001 consolidated financial statements. Our procedures included a agreeing the adjusted amounts of 2001 reportable segment information contained in
Note 12 to the Companys underlying records obtained from management, and b testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliations of 2001 reportable segment amounts to the consolidated financial statements.  In our opinion, the adjustments and disclosures described in i, ii and
iii above are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and
adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.  /s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP  Cleveland, Ohio January 21, 2004

Organization and Nature of Business  Stoneridge, Inc.
Stoneridge and its subsidiaries are independent designers and manufacturers of engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive, medium- and heavy-duty truck, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stoneridge and its wholly-owned and
majority-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at
cost, which approximates fair value.  Accounts Receivable Concentrations
Revenues are principally generated from the automotive,
medium- and heavy-duty truck, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets. Due to the nature of these industries, a significant portion of sales and related accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers. In 2003,
the Companys top four customers individually accounted for approximately 17%, 11%, 9% and 9% of net sales, while the top five customers accounted for 53% of net sales. In 2002, the Companys top four customers individually accounted for
approximately 13%, 13%, 10% and 10% of net sales, while the top five customers accounted for approximately 52% of net sales. In 2001, the Companys top four customers individually accounted for 14%, 13%, 12% and 12% of net sales, while the top
five customers accounted for 57% of net sales. Accounts receivable from the Companys five largest customers aggregated approximately $51,240 and $30,363 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Inventories  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out LIFO method for
approximately 68% and 73% of the Companys inventories at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and by the first-in, first-out FIFO method for all other inventories. Inventory cost includes material, labor and overhead. Inventories
consist of the following at December 31:  2003 2002 Raw materials 25,035 28,157 Work in progress 10,414 10,229 Finished goods 13,903 13,313 49,352 51,699 Less: LIFO reserve 710 560 Total 48,642 51,139

Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and consist of the following at December 31:  2003 2002 Land and land improvements 5,677 5,583 Buildings and improvements 42,456 45,003 Machinery and equipment 117,153 99,711 Office furniture and fixtures 27,986 26,205 Tooling 57,602 50,436 Vehicles 589 668 Leasehold improvements 1,237 1,249 252,700 228,855 Less: Accumulated depreciation 136,438 117,017 116,262 111,838  Depreciation is
provided by both the straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $21,904, $21,083 and $18,664, respectively. Depreciable lives
within each property classification are as follows:  Buildings and improvements
1040years
Machinery and equipment
520 years
Office furniture and fixtures
310 years
Tooling
25 years
Vehicles
35 years
Leasehold improvements
38 years
Maintenance and repair
expenditures that are not considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of property are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements and major renewals are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of,
the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on the disposition is credited or charged to income.  Goodwill and Other Intangibles  Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is subject to at least an annual
assessment for impairment by applying a fair value-based test. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS 142, the Company completed the two-step transitional goodwill impairment analysis for both reporting units of the Company as of
January 1, 2002. The initial impairment test indicated that the carrying values of the reporting units exceeded the corresponding fair values of the reporting units, which were determined based on a combination of valuation techniques including the
guideline company method, the transaction method and the discounted cash flow method. The implied fair value of goodwill in these reporting units was then determined through the allocation of the fair values to the underlying assets and liabilities.
The January 1, 2002 carrying value of the goodwill in these reporting units exceeded their implied fair value by $901 million. The $698 million write-down of goodwill to its fair value, which is net of $203 million of related tax benefits, was
reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of January 1, 2002. The Company performed an annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1, 2002 and 2003 and no additional impairment
was recognized.

Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities  Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following at December 31:  2003
2002
Compensation-related obligations 16,173 14,899
Insurance-related obligations 6,796 7,443
Income tax-related obligations 9,945 2,740
Warranty-related obligations 5,515 4,248
Other 16,140 15,740 54,569 45,070  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the provisions of SFAS 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are recognized to
the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.  Currency Translation  The financial statements
of foreign subsidiaries, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the period end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for
the results of operations. Adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Foreign currency transactions are remeasured into the functional currency using
translation rates in effect at the time of the transaction, with the resulting adjustments included in the results of operations.  Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments  The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products, net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns and historical
trends in sales returns, at the point of passage of title, which is generally at the time of shipment. The Company often enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicles expected production life. Once such
agreements are entered into, it is the Companys obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements generally may be terminated by the Companys customers at
any time, but usually are not.  Bad Debts  The Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a
combination of factors. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized
receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. Additionally, the Company reviews historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts. If economic circumstances change
substantially, estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be reduced by a material amount.  Warranty Reserves  The Companys warranty reserve is established based on the Companys best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims
on products sold as of the balance sheet date. While the Company believes that its warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgments applied are appropriate, such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will
actually transpire in the future. 
28 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated 
The Companys warranty reserve at December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $5,515 and $4,248,
respectively. These warranty reserve balances included payments made of $3,388 and $3,474, costs recognized for warranties issued during the period of $4,644 and $4,443 and changes in estimates for preexisting warranties of $11 and $104, for the
periods ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Product Development
Expenses  Expenses associated with the development of new
products and changes to existing products are charged to expense as incurred. These costs amounted to $28,714, $25,332 and $26,996 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Share-Based Compensation  At December 31, 2003, the Company had two share-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 7. Prior to 2003, the Company
accounted for employee share options granted under these plans using the intrinsic value method provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. No
share-based employee compensation cost was recognized in 2002 and 2001, as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common shares on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, the
Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified or settled after January 1, 2003, under the disclosure provisions of SFAS
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of SFAS 123. Awards under the Companys plans cliff-vest over periods ranging from one to five years, and compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis. Therefore, the cost related to share-based employee compensation recognized in 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards granted since
the original effective date of SFAS 123. The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and net income loss per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

The fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  2003
2002
2001

Expected volatility
4652%-4659 5947 4040%4100%
The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected
share price volatility and expected option lives.  Financial Instruments and
Derivative Financial Instruments  Financial instruments
held by the Company include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt and forward currency contracts. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable is considered to
be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the Companys variable rate debt approximates its fair value. Refer to Note 9 of the Companys consolidated financial statements for
fair value disclosures of the Companys fixed rate debt, and foreign currency forward contracts.  Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
including certain self-insured risks and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because actual
results could differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.  Net Income Loss Per Share  Net income loss per share amounts for all periods are presented in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings per Share, which requires the
presentation of basic net income loss per share and diluted net income loss per share. Basic net income loss per share was computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for each respective
period. Diluted net income loss per share was calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the periods presented. Actual weighted-average shares outstanding
used in calculating basic and diluted net income loss per share were as follows:  FortheyearsendedDecember31 2003

SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes foreign currency translation adjustments and gains and losses from certain foreign currency transactions, the effective portion of gains
and losses on certain hedging activities, minimum pension liability adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. 
30 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated 
Balances of each after-tax component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, as reported in
the Statement of Consolidated Shareholders Equity as of December 31, are as follows:  2003 2002 2001 Currency translation adjustments 2,458 1,350 3,746 Change in fair value of derivatives 620 4,310 Minimum pension liability adjustments 1,264 821 Unrealized loss on marketable securities 81 202 1,113 2,993 8,056  Impairment of Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and
identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. No significant impairment charges were recorded in 2003, 2002 and 2001.
Impairment would be recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recovered. Measurement of the amount of impairment may be based on appraisal, market values of similar assets or
estimated discounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset.  Accounting Standards  In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. Among other things, SFAS 145
requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under SFAS 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt
an amendment of APB Opinion No. 30. Any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in APB 30, Reporting the Results of Operations
Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for classification as an extraordinary item, shall be reclassified. The Company adopted this
Statement effective January 1, 2003, and accordingly, the extraordinary loss of $36 million, net of tax, recorded in the second quarter of 2002 as a result of the early extinguishment of debt was reclassified as a component of income from
continuing operations in 2003. Therefore, income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change as well as the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2002 were restated as follows:  Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, as originally reported 38,089 Loss on extinguishment of debt, pre-tax 5,771 Income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change, as restated 32,318 Provision for income taxes, as originally reported 13,426 Tax benefit from loss on extinguishment of debt 2,164 Provision for income taxes, as restated 11,262  In July 2002, the FASB
issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The adoption of SFAS 146 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 
31 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated 
In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how public companies classify and measure in their statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. This Statement became effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 did not
impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.  In January 2003, the FASB issued interpretation FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an Interpretation of ARB No. 51. FIN 46 requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their
primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved. The provisions of FIN 46 were applicable immediately to all variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003. In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 revised December 2003, which includes significant amendments to previously issued FIN 46.
Among other things, FIN 46R includes revised transition dates for public entities. The Company is now required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46R no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after March 15, 2004. The adoption of
this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements or results of operations.  Reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to their 2003 presentation in the consolidated financial statements.  3. Investments  The Company has a 50% interest in PST Industria Eletronica da Amazonia Ltda. PST, a Brazilian electronic components
business that specializes in electronic vehicle security devices. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Companys investment in PST was $13,309 and $11,814 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company has loaned PST $5,843, which includes accrued interest.  4.
Long-Term Debt  On May 1, 2002, the Company issued $2000
million aggregate principal amount of senior notes. The $2000 million notes bear interest at an annual rate of 1150% and mature on May 1, 2012. Interest is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. On July 1, 2002, the Company completed an
exchange offer of the senior notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933.  In conjunction with the issuance of the senior notes, the Company also entered into a new $2000 million credit agreement with a bank group. The credit
agreement has two components: a $1000 million revolving facility of which $959 million was available at December 31, 2003, which includes a $100 million swing line facility, and a $1000 million term facility. The revolving facility expires on
April 30, 2007 and requires a commitment fee of 0375% to 0500% on the unused balance as well as a utilization fee of 0125% to 0250% when the unutilized balance equals or exceeds 500% of the total revolving commitment. The revolving facility
permits the Company to borrow up to half its borrowings in specified foreign currencies. Interest is payable quarterly at either i the prime rate plus a margin of 050% to 150% or ii LIBOR plus a margin of 200% to 300%, depending upon the
Companys ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA, as defined. Interest on the swing line facility is payable monthly at the quoted overnight borrowing rate plus a
margin of 200% to 300%, depending upon the Companys ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA. The term facility was due to expire on April 30, 2008 and had interest payable quarterly at either i the prime rate plus 175% or
ii LIBOR plus 325%. The Company has the right to prepay any of the above-mentioned loans in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. During the first quarter of 2003, the Company prepaid $200 million of the term facility and during the
fourth quarter of 2003, prepaid the entire remaining balance outstanding under the term facility of $285 million.

The weighted average interest rate in effect for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
approximately 1024%, 953% and 939%, respectively, including the effects of the interest rate swap agreements.  Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:  2003

foreign subsidiaries were $11,062, $12,046 and $10,978 as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes. It is
impracticable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes with respect to these earnings; however, foreign tax credits should be available to reduce U.S. income taxes in the event of a distribution.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at December

Lease payments made by the Company to HSI were $301 in 2003 and $357 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The lease terminates in December 2009. The Company believes the terms of the lease are no less favorable to it than would be the terms of a
third-party lease.  Earl Linehan, a director of the Company,
and D.M. Draime, Chairman of the Company, as limited partners, own 1181% and 1000%, respectively, of Industrial Development Associates IDA, a Maryland limited partnership real estate development company in which the Company is a 30%
general partner. The Company has a lease agreement with IDA pursuant to which the Company leases a facility located in Mebane, North Carolina. The lease expires on March 31, 2004. The Company is responsible for all maintenance, taxes and insurance
costs related to the operations of the facility. The Company made lease payments to IDA of $115, $152 and $181 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company believes the terms of the lease are no less favorable to it than would be the terms of
a third-party lease.  For the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, lease expense totaled $6,278, $6,604 and $5,713, including related party lease expense of $451, $509 and $538, respectively.  Future minimum operating lease commitments at December 31, 2003 are as follows:  ThirdParty

The Company has certain defined contribution profit
sharing and 401k plans covering substantially all of its employees. Company contributions are generally discretionary; however, a portion of these contributions is based upon a percentage of employee compensation, as defined in the plans. The
Companys policy is to fund all benefit costs accrued. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, expenses related to these plans amounted to $3,757, $345 and $3,301, respectively. 
36 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated 
The Company has a single defined benefit pension plan that covers certain employees in Europe. The
following table sets forth the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of the Companys plan; amounts recognized in the Companys financial statements; and the principal weighted average assumptions used:
2003 2002 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year 13,120 11,226 Service cost 490 630 Interest cost 800 735 Participant contributions 180 195 Curtailment 1,945 Actuarial gain 1,634 525 Benefits paid 751 390 Translation adjustments 1,642 1,249 Benefit obligation at end of year 15,170 13,120 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year 10,882 11,488 Actual return on plan assets 1,699 1,515 Employer contributions 245 Participant contributions 180 195 Benefits paid 751 390 Translation adjustments 1,309 1,104 Fair value of plan assets at end of year 13,564 10,882 Funded status 1,606 2,238 Unrecognized actuarial loss 2,106 3,123 Net amount recognized 500 885 Amounts recognized in the balance sheet consist of Accrued liability benefit 1,606 483 Other comprehensive income 2,106 1,368 Net amount recognized 500 885 Weighted average assumptions as of December 31 Discount rate 575 600 Expected return on plan assets 725 725 Rate of increase to compensation levels N/A 325 Rate of increase to pensions in payments 300 300 Rate of future price inflation 275 225  Components of net
periodic pension cost are as follows:  2003 2002 2001 Service cost 490 630 821 Interest cost 800 735 648 Expected return on plan assets 784 825 849 Amortization of actuarial loss 180 Net periodic pension cost 686 540 620  The provisions of SFAS
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, required the Company to record an additional minimum liability of $738 with a corresponding charge recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income of $443, net of tax of
$295, at December 31, 2003. The additional minimum pension liability was $1,368 with a corresponding charge recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $821, net of tax of $547, at December 31, 2002. This liability represents
the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded. 
37 Table of Contents STONERIDGE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise indicated 
On December 31, 2003 the Company amended the defined benefit plan to eliminate the linkage between
future service and salary derived plan benefits. The defined benefit plan will continue to provide certain life insurance and disability benefits to participants. Affected members of the plan, which number 159, have been offered membership in the
Companys defined contribution plan. As a result of the curtailment, the projected benefit obligation of the plan was reduced by $1,945.  The Company does not provide any other significant retirement, post-retirement or post-employment benefits to its employees.  9. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an obligation to
deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity
of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Companys variable rate debt approximates book value, as under the terms of the borrowing arrangements, a portion of the obligations are subject to fluctuating market rates of interest. The
estimated fair value of the Companys fixed rate debt at December 31, 2003, per quoted market sources, was $2358 million and the carrying value was $2000 million.  The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest
rates swaps and currency rates forward contracts. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for speculative or profit motivated purposes. Management believes that its use of these instruments to reduce risk is in the Companys
best interest.  In order to manage the interest rate risk
associated with the Companys previous debt portfolio, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements. These agreements required the Company to pay a fixed interest rate to counterparties while receiving a floating interest rate based
on LIBOR. The counterparties to each of the interest rate swap agreements were major commercial banks. These agreements were due to mature on or before December 31, 2003 and qualified as cash flow hedges; however, as a result of the Companys
debt refinancing, these agreements were terminated on May 1, 2002. Hedging activities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are as follows:  Fortheyearsended December31 2003 2002 2001 Amortization of terminated swap agreements, pre-tax 991 4,283  Tax effect 372 1,606 Amortization of terminated swap agreements, net of tax 620 2,677  Change in fair value of swap agreements, pre-tax  1,408 6,267 Tax effect 394 2,225 Change in fair value of swap agreements, net of tax  1,014 4,042 Cumulative effect of change in accounting for swap agreements, pre-tax   416 Tax effect 148 Cumulative effect of change in accounting for swap agreements, net of tax   268  As of December 31,
2003 these terminated swap agreements were fully amortized into income.  The Company has entered into foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional value of 226 million of Swedish krona to reduce exposure related to the Companys krona denominated debt obligations. The estimated fair value of
these forward contracts at December 31, 2003, per quoted market sources, was $03 million. These forward contracts are marked to market, with gains and losses recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Companys foreign
currency forward purchase contracts substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying foreign denominated debt obligations and receivables.

10. Commitments and Contingencies  In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings, workers compensation and
product liability disputes. Management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or the financial position of the Company.  On January 15, 2004, a judgment was entered against the Company in the
District Court 365th Judicial District in Maverick County, Texas. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that a
Stoneridge fuel valve installed as a replacement part on a truck caused a fire after an accident resulting in a death. The plaintiffs are the parents of the decedent. The final judgment entered against the Company was approximately $365 million.
The Company denies its fuel valve contributed to the fire. A motion for a new trial and other relief is pending before the trial court. A vigorous appeal of this judgment will be undertaken if the trial court denies relief. The Company believes that
there are valid grounds to reverse the judgment on appeal. If successful, the appeal may alter or eliminate the amount of the existing judgment. While legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that it is reasonably
possible that this award will be substantially altered or eliminated by the appellate court. Consequently, in the opinion of management and counsel, it is not possible to estimate the outcome of such uncertainty at this time. The Company will record
a provision for any liability in this case, if and at the time that management and counsel conclude a loss is probable.  11. Related Party Transactions  Avery Cohen, a director of the Company, is a partner in Baker Hostetler LLP, a law firm, which has served as general outside counsel for the Company
since 1993 and is expected to continue to do so in the future. The Company paid $940, $1,082 and $721 in legal fees to Baker Hostetler during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  See Note 6 to the Companys consolidated financial statements for information on the Companys related party
transactions involving operating leases.  12. Segment Reporting
SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that are evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Companys chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.  The Company has two reportable operating segments: Vehicle Management Power Distribution and Control Devices. These
reportable operating segments were determined based on the differences in the nature of the products offered. The Vehicle Management Power Distribution operating segment produces electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units, driver
information systems and electrical distribution systems, primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution. The Control Devices operating segment produces electronic and electromechanical switches, control
actuation devices and sensors.  The accounting policies of the
Companys operating segments are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based primarily on revenues from external customers,
net income and capital expenditures. Intersegment sales are accounted for on terms similar to those to third parties and are eliminated upon consolidation.
