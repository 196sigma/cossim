The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Central European Distribution Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Central
European Distribution Corporation as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Central
European Distribution Corporation at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

are as follows Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Central
European Distribution Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-
company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements.
CEDC subsidiaries maintain their books of account and prepare their
statutory financial statements in Polish zloties PLN in accordance with
Polish statutory requirements and the Accounting Act of 29 September 1994. The
subsidiaries' financial statements have been adjusted to reflect generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
For all of the Company subsidiaries the functional currency is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the
exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income Statement accounts are
translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year.
Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from
period to period are included as a component of shareholders' equity. Gains
and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income for
the period.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in US
Dollars.
The exchange rates used on Polish zloty denominated transactions and
balances for translation purposes as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 for one US
dollar were 414PLN and 398PLN, respectively. As of March 1, 2002 the rate
had changed to 421 PLN.
Equipment
Equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of
equipment is computed by the straight-line method over the following useful
lives                                   Depreciation

Transportation equipment under capital leases.    2
Transportation     6
Beer dispensing and other    2-10  Leased equipment meeting certain criteria is capitalized and the present
value of the related lease payments is recorded as a liability. Amortization
of capitalized leased assets is computed on a straight-line method over the
term of the lease.
The Company periodically reviews equipment, when indicators of impairment
exist and if the value of the asset is impaired, an impairment loss is
recognized.
Goodwill
Acquired goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of
the expected economic benefit 20 years. The Company assesses the
recoverability of its goodwill whenever adverse events or changes in
circumstances or business climate indicate that expected future cash flows
undiscounted and without interest charges for individual business units may
not be sufficient to support the recorded goodwill. If undiscounted cash flows
are not sufficient to support the goodwill, an impairment charge would be
recognized to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill based on the expected
discounted cash flows of the business unit. No such charge has been considered
necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements.
Intangible assets
Intangibles consist primarily of acquired trademarks. The trademarks are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected economic
benefits 10 years. The Company assesses the recoverability of its trademarks
whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate
indicate that expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest
charges for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the
recorded trademarks. If undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to support
the recorded assets, an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the
carrying value of the trademarks. No such charge has been considered necessary
through the date of the accompanying financial statements.
35          CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information  The acquired trademarks in the amount of $4,077,000 had accumulated
amortization of $879,000 and $1,146,000 for 2000 and 2001 respectively.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when goods are shipped or delivered to customers. The
Company only recognizes revenue and margin when goods have been shipped to
customers on the basis of a validated customer order. The Company does not
operate a policy of goods shipped on consignment nor does it offer goods on a
sale or return basis.
Advertising and Promotion Costs
Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and
promotion costs not reimbursed by suppliers were approximately $359,000 278,000 and $300,000 in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market. Cost includes customs duty and transportation costs. Inventories are
comprised primarily of beer, wine, spirits, and non-alcoholic beverages.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Short-term investments that have a maturity of three months or less from
the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Substantially all of
these amounts were located in bank accounts in Poland at December 31, 2001.
Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may
be material to the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The Company computes and records income taxes in accordance with the
liability method.
Employee Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company accounts for its
employee stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly,
no compensation costs have been recognized for fixed stock options issued
under the Company employee stock incentive plan. The Company discloses pro
forma net income and net income per share as if the fair value method of SFAS
No. 123 had been used see Note 14.
Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments forward foreign currency
contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to
reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates. Such
contracts are used primarily to hedge certain foreign denominated obligations.
The Company policy is to maintain hedge coverage only on existing
obligations. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the
value of the related exposures in accordance with SFAS 133 as amended by SFAS
138, which was adopted by the Company in 2001. The adoption of SFAS 133/138,
did not have a material effect
36          CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information
on the consolidated financial statements. The principal currencies hedged are
the U.S. Dollars, and the Euro. The duration of the hedge contract typically
does not exceed six months. The counter-parties to the contracts are large,
reputable commercial banks and accordingly, the Company expects all counter-
parties to meet their obligations.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in equity during a period
except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
Comprehensive income includes net income adjusted by, among other items,
foreign currency translation adjustments. The foreign translation losses/gains
on the remeasurements from Polish zloties to US dollars are classified
separately and the only component of the accumulated other comprehensive
income included in shareholders' equity.
During the period ended December 31, 2001, the Company incurred foreign
currency translation gains of $559,000 and reported this amount as part of the
accumulated comprehensive loss in shareholders' equity. During 2001, the
Polish zloty strengthened during the second half of the year and as a result
reduced the amount of the currency translation loss as compared to the
previous year. Additionally translation losses with respect to long-term
inter-company transactions with the parent company are charged to other
comprehensive loss. No deferred tax benefit has been recorded on the
comprehensive loss in regards to the long-term inter-company transactions with
the parent company, as the repayment of the loan is not anticipated in the
foreseeable future.
Segment Reporting
The Company operates in one industry segment, the distribution of alcoholic
and non-alcoholic beverages. These activities are conducted by Carey Agri,
MTC, CFW, PHA, Astor and FWS in Poland. Substantially all revenues, operating
profits and assets relate to this business. CEDC assets excluding inter-
company loans and investments located in the United States of America
represent less than 1% of consolidated assets.
Net Income Per Common Share
Net income per common share is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share EPS are computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the year. The stock options and warrants
discussed in Note 14 were included in the computation of diluted earnings per
common share Note 9.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the financial statements have been reclassified from
prior years to conform to the current year presentation.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2001, the FASB released SFAS 141 Business Combinations. This
Statement requires that Combinations are accounted for by a single method--the
purchase method. This Statement also requires separate recognition of
intangible assets apart from goodwill if they meet the prescribed criteria.
Disclosure of the primary reasons for the business combination is required and
the allocation of the purchase price paid to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed by major balance sheet caption is necessary. When the
amounts of goodwill and intangible assets acquired are significant in relation
to the purchase price paid, disclosure of other information about those assets
is required. The provisions of this Statement apply to all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. The Company does not anticipate
any reclassifications of intangible assets from the application of SFAS 141.
In June 2001, the FASB released SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible
assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes
37          CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information
APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. It addresses how intangible assets that
are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those
acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial
statements upon their acquisition. This Statement also addresses how goodwill
and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been
initially recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of this
Statement are required to be applied starting with fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. Upon adoption of the new standard, the Company
anticipates that all amortization of goodwill as a charge to earnings will be
eliminated. Goodwill amortization charged to earnings during 2001 amounted to
approximately $494,000.
In August 2001, the FASB released SFAS 144 Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This standard supersedes SFAS 121
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be disposed of. This statement removes goodwill from its scope, addressed
in SFAS 142 and addresses long-lived assets to be held and used, to be
disposed of other than by sale and to be disposed of by sale. The provisions
of this statements are required to be applied starting with fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company does not anticipate that this
statement will have a material effect on their financial statements.

Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information  The weighted average interest rate on all bank loans and overdraft
facilities was 82% and 87% for December 31, 2000 and 2001 respectively. This
increase is due to the larger proportion of local currency debt within the
debt portfolio.

10. Acquisitions
The Company completed the acquisition of Astor Sp. z o.o. effective April
5, 2001, for a cash purchase price of $1,200,000 and 31,264 shares of CEDC
stock stock valued at approximately $98,000 The shares issued may not be
sold without the Company consent for three years subsequent to the
acquisition date. As part of the purchase agreement with Astor, a non-compete
agreement was established with the former stockholders for a period of three
years. The terms of the agreement allow for an additional payment of both cash
and Company stock, which are contingent upon Astor Sp. z o.o. achieving a
certain profit target. As at December 31, 2001, Astor achieved their projected
earnings and as a result the Company has accrued $369,000 and 44,753 shares of
CEDC stock valued at approximately $498,000. If the acquired company is able
to achieve the remaining targeted earnings, the total acquisition cost is
expected to be approximately $4,000,000. Astor Sp. z o.o. is based in Olsztyn,
Poland. Its primary area of activity is the distribution of various spirits
and non-alcoholic beverages.
The Company acquired 97% of the voting shares of Astor Sp. z o.o. Based on
the purchase agreement the remaining 3% of the voting shares will be received
by the Company over the next three years. No additional payment for this added
interest is required.

Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information  The acquisition of Astor Sp. z o.o. has been accounted for as a purchase,
and the operating results of the acquired company have been included in the
consolidated condensed financial statements from the date of acquisition. The
acquired goodwill will be amortized over a 20 year period. The amortization of
the acquired goodwill will cease as of January 1, 2002 as discussed in
Summary of significant accounting policies--recently issued accounting
pronouncements.
The acquisition was financed using the Company loan facilities and
issuance of Company stock as indicated above. The remaining contingent
consideration if any, is expected to be finalized during the first quarter of
2003 and 2004.
The Company obtained an independent valuation for this acquisition. The
cost of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible assets acquired based on
the underlying book values which approximated fair values at dates of
acquisition and estimated values per the valuation report. Astor had commenced
operations at the end of 2000 and thus no significant difference between book
values and estimated fair values existed. The excess $2,245,000 of the cost
over the amounts allocated as described above represents goodwill.
On March 31, 2000, the Company purchased 100% of the voting shares of
Polskie Hurtownie Alkoholi Sp. z o.o. PHA for $4 million cash and 268,126
shares of Common Stock. The shares issued may not be sold without the
Company consent for three years subsequent to the acquisition. As part of
the purchase agreement with PHA a non-compete agreement was established with
the former stockholders for a period of three years.
The Company obtained an independent valuation for this acquisition. The
cost of the acquisition was allocated to the tangible assets acquired based on
the fair values at dates of acquisition and estimated values per the valuation
report. The excess $5,490,000 of the cost over the amounts allocated as
described above represents goodwill.
Assuming consummation of the PHA and Astor acquisitions and the issuance of
common shares as of January 1, 2000, the un-audited pro-forma consolidated
operating results for 2000 and 2001 are as follows                                 2000   2001

Financial Instruments With On-Balance Sheet Risk and Their Fair Values
Financial instruments with on-balance sheet risk include cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, certain other current assets, trade accounts
payable, overdraft facilities, and other payables. These financial instruments
are disclosed separately in the consolidated balance sheets and their carrying
values approximate their fair market values. The Companies on-balance sheet
risk is minimal as the financial instruments are denominated in stable
currencies and they are of a short-term nature whose interest rates
approximate current market rates.
43          CENTRAL EUROPEAN DISTRIBUTION CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable from Polish companies.
The Company restricts temporary cash investments to financial institutions
with high credit standing. Credit is given to customers only after a thorough
review of their credit worthiness. The Company does not normally require
collateral with respect to credit sales. The Company routinely assesses the
financial strength of its customers. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
Company had no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Company has not
experienced large credit losses in the past.
Inflation and Currency Risk
The Polish government has adopted policies that in recent years has lowered
and made more predictable the country level of inflation. The annual rate of
inflation was approximately 98% in 1999, 85% in 2000 and 36% in 2001. The
exchange rate for the zloty had stabilized and the rate of devaluation of the
zloty had decreased for the last several years. During the first two quarters
of 2001, the zloty decreased in value in respect to the US dollar, while in
the latter half of the year made a strong recovery against the US dollar.
Inflation and currency exchange fluctuations have had, and may continue to
have, an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations
of the Company.
A portion of Carey Agri, MTC, CFW and ASTOR loans and accounts
payable and operating expenses are expected to continue to be, denominated in
or indexed to the U.S. Dollar or other non-Polish denominated currency. By
contrast, substantially all of the Company revenue is denominated in Polish
zloty. Any devaluation of the zloty against the U.S. Dollar or other
currencies that the Company is unable to offset through price adjustments will
require the Company to use a larger portion of its revenue to service its non-
zloty denominated obligations. While the Company may enter into transactions
to hedge the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, it is unlikely that the
Company will be able to obtain hedging arrangements to completely eliminate
the currency risk. Accordingly, shifts in the currency exchange rates may have
an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to service its non-zloty
denominated obligations and, therefore may have an effect on the Company
financial condition and results of operations.
Supply contracts
The Company has various agreements covering its sources of supply, which,
in some cases, may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice.
Thus, there is a risk that a significant portion of the Company supply of
products could be curtailed at any time. The Company has made payments to
suppliers to secure longer-term sources of supply.
Contingent liabilities
The Company is involved in some litigation and has claims against it for
matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
management, the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company operations.

Prior to January 1, 2001, the Company had a policy to permanently reinvest
their earnings. As of January 1, 2001, the Company instituted a policy of
having all of its subsidiaries except Carey Agri pay dividends. Management
intends to distribute 50% of the earnings from the Polish subsidiaries for
2001.
The retained earnings prior to January 1, 2001 are not considered
distributable. Deferred taxes have been created for these distributable
earnings.
No deferred taxes have been created for the remaining undistributed
earnings as the Company intends to permanently reinvest these earnings.
In November 1999, legislation was enacted which reduced the corporate
income tax rates in Poland effective January 1, 2000. The expected tax rate of
32% was reduced to 30% in 2000, 28% in 2001 and 2002, 24% in 2003 and 22%
thereafter.
Carey Agri, MTC, CFW, PHA, FWS, and Astor tax liabilities
including corporate income tax, Value Added Tax VAT, social security and
other taxes may be subject to examinations by Polish tax authorities for up
to five years from the end of the year the tax is payable. CEDC US federal
income tax returns are also subject to examination by the US tax authorities.
As the application of tax laws and regulations, and transactions are
susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determination
by the tax authorities.

14. Stock Option Plans and Warrants
Incentive Plan
In November 1997, the CEDC 1997 Stock Incentive Plan Incentive Plan was
created. This Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units to directors,
executives, and other employees of CEDC and any of its subsidiaries or of any
service providers. The Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 750,000
shares of Common Stock subject to anti-dilution adjustments in the event of a
stock split, recapitalization, or similar transaction. The compensation
committee of the board of directors will administer the Incentive Plan. The
Company has reserved 750,000 shares for future issuance in relation to the
Incentive Plan.
The option exercise price for incentive stock options granted under the
Incentive Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of grant of the option. Options may be exercised up
to 10 years after grant, except as otherwise provided in the particular option
agreement. Payment for shares purchased under the Incentive Plan shall be made
in cash or cash equivalents. With respect to any participant who owns stock
possessing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of CEDC,
however, the exercise price of any incentive stock option granted must equal
at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date and the maximum term
of an incentive stock option must not exceed five years.

Monetary amounts in columns expressed in thousands
except per share information Stock Options Granted
CEDC has granted stock options in early 1998 to its executive officers and
members of the Board of Directors for 82,500 shares of Common Stock in
connection with its initial public offering. The exercise price for 57,500 of
these options is the initial public offering price of $ 650 per share. The
exercise price of 10,000 options was the average trading price of Common Stock
for the last five trading days of 1998 of $570. The exercise price of 15,000
options is $489. These options may be exercised over a ten-year period.
The Company has granted stock options under the Incentive Plan for 129,250
shares of Common Stock in September 1998 to certain of its employees. Options
for 21,500 shares have an exercise price of $650 and may be exercised from
September 1999 to September 2008. Options for 43,000 shares will have an
exercise price based on the market value of common shares as of August 1999
and are exercisable from September 2000 to September 2008. Options for 64,750
shares have an exercise price of $363 and are exercisable from August 2001 to
September 2008.
During 2000 and 2001, the Company granted 50,000 and 89,000 stock options
respectively, to its staff, executive officers and members of the Board of
Directors. In 2000, the exercise price for the options was based on the market
price at the date of the option grant. In 2001, the exercise price for the
options was based on the market price on the day before the grant. The option
price ranged from $225 to $504.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its incentive stock options under the fair value method of that
Statement.
In regards to the options granted in connection with the initial public
offering, the Company has estimated the fair market value of the stock
underlying these options to be approximately 50% of the planned public
offering price due to various uncertainties as of the time of grant. This is
less than the present value of the expected exercise price. Therefore, the
fair value of the options granted in connection with the initial public
offering has been estimated to be minimal under the provisions of SFAS No.
123.
As for the other stock options granted to employees, the fair value was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999, 2000 and 2001 risk-free
interest rate of 55% dividend yield of 0%, volatility factors of the expected
market price of the Company Common Stock of 068, and a weighted-average
expected life of the option of 10 years.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models
require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected
stock price volatility. Since the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not

16. Derivative financial instruments
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments. All
derivatives, whether designated as hedging relationships or not, are required
to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses
derivatives to moderate the financial market risks of its business operations.
Derivative products such as forward contracts are used to hedge the foreign
currency market exposures underlying certain liabilities with financial
institutions. The Company accounting policies for these instruments are
based on its designation of these instruments as hedging transactions. An
instrument is designated as a hedge based in part on its effectiveness in risk
reduction and one-to-one matching of derivatives with the related balance
sheet risk.
The Company has designated forward contracts as fair value hedges i.e.,
hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of the foreign denominated
bank loans, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the
offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings in the current period.
The adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in no cumulative
adjustment to the financial statements.
For currency forward contracts, effectiveness is measured by using the
forward-to-forward rate compared to the underlying economic exposure. The
Company hedging policy was considered highly effective during the nine month
period ended September 30, 2001. The ineffective portion for the nine-month
period ended of $294,000 gain was recognized in non-operating income. During
the fourth quarter, the Company hedging policy was not considered highly
effective. The Company recognized a $357,000 loss in non-operating income in
regards to their forward contracts during the fourth quarter.
The fair value amount of open forward contracts as at December 31, 2000 was
nil and as at December 31, 2001 were $7,677,000 and $1,493,000 $ amount
equivalent to EURO contract, respectively.
