DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2015 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies 
Description of Business Deltic Timber Corporation Deltic or the
Company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacturing and marketing of lumber and medium density fiberboard MDF. Deltic owns approximately 530,000 acres of
timberland, primarily in Arkansas and north Louisiana. The Companys sawmill operations are located at Ola in central Arkansas and at Waldo in south Arkansas, and the MDF plant is located near El Dorado, Arkansas. In addition to its timber,
lumber, and MDF operations, the Company is engaged in real estate development in central Arkansas. 
Business Environment The Company is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity-based
business environment with a major diversification in real estate development. This environment is affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, building product imports, foreign exchange
rates, housing starts, new and existing housing inventory, foreclosures, residential repair and remodeling, commercial construction and repair, industry capacity and production levels, the availability of contractors for logging, hauling, and
shipping, the availability of raw materials, natural gas pricing, costs of fuel, and weather conditions. 
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of Deltic Timber Corporation include the
accounts of Deltic, all majority-owned subsidiaries, and any variable interest entities of which it is the primary beneficiary. Equity investments and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method, if it is determined that the Company
does not have control of the entity. Significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. 
Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at fair value on the acquisition date using appropriate valuation methods. The operations of the acquisitions are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
For additional information, see Note 4 Business Combinations. Use of Estimates In the
preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include investments that have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records trade accounts receivable at
net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade accounts receivable balances and is charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. The allowance is
based upon review of specific receivables outstanding and considers factors such as current overall economic conditions, industry-specific economic conditions, historical customer performance, and anticipated customer performance. In the
consolidated statements of income, bad debt expense is included in cost of sales. Provisions for bad debt expense were $133,000, $150,000, and $158,000 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts were
$133,000, $188,000, and $137,000 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. At December31, 2015 and 2014, the balance in the allowance account was $130,000 and $123,000, respectively.

Inventories Inventories of logs, wood fiber, lumber, MDF,
and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market within Deltics operating areas, primarily using the average cost method. Log costs include harvest and transportation costs as appropriate. Lumber and MDF costs include materials, labor,
and production overhead. For additional information, see Note 2 Inventories. Investment in
Del-Tin Fiber On April1, 2013, the Company acquired the remaining 50 percent membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber, which had been accounted for as an equity method investment and is now included as a wholly-owned consolidated
subsidiary. For additional information, see Note 4 Business Combinations. Investment in Real
Estate Held for Development and Sale Real estate held for development and sale includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs, including amenities. Indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or
acreage sold based on relative retail sales values. Direct costs are allocated to a specific neighborhood or commercial real estate tract, while indirect costs for the Companys four developments Chenal Valley, Wildwood Place, Chenal
Downs, and Red Oak Ridge are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail sales values. Timber and Timberlands Timber and timberlands, which include timberland, fee timber, purchased stumpage inventory, and logging facilities, are stated at cost, less the cost of fee timber
harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities, and include no estimated future reforestation costs. The cost of timber consists of fee timber acquired and reforestation costs, which include site preparation, seedlings, and labor. The
cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable. Logging facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements, are depreciated using
the straight-line method over a ten-year estimated life. The Company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques. Fee timber carrying costs,
commercial thinning, silviculture, and timberland management costs are expensed as incurred. The Company classifies its
timberlands and fee timber as either strategic or non-strategic. Strategic timberlands, including pine forest and pine plantations, are prime pine sawtimber-growing platforms located within or immediately adjacent to the Company sawmills
operating regions. Deltic manages these acres using modern silviculture methods to achieve optimal volume and quality of its pine sawtimber. The Company harvests pine sawtimber and pine pulpwood in accordance with its harvest plans and generally
converts pine sawtimber into lumber in its own sawmills and sells pine pulpwood, hardwood pulpwood, and hardwood sawtimber in the market. Upon harvest, strategic timberlands are reforested. The Companys timberland acquisition program is
focused on the acquisition of pine-growing timberland in its current operating regions. This investment in strategic fee timber is a productive asset, and any occasional sale of strategic timberland or any expenditure to acquire such
timber and timberlands is included in and classified as an investing activity in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company has legacy hardwood and other acreage which cannot be harvested for conversion in Company
sawmills, reforested as pine plantations, or managed efficiently using modern silviculture methods either due to the size of the tract or lack of proximity to other Deltic fee timberlands. These timberlands have been identified as non-strategic
and/or higher and better use timberlands and are expected to be sold over time. The Company considers these sales to be an operating activity of its Woodlands segment.

Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
In order to acquire and sell assets, primarily timberlands, in a tax efficient manner,
the Company enters into tax-deferred, like-kind exchange LKE transactions when possible. The Company generally enters into forward transactions, in which property is sold and the proceeds are reinvested by acquiring similar property,
and reverse transactions, in which property is acquired and similar property is subsequently sold. A qualified LKE intermediary is used to facilitate LKE transactions. Proceeds from forward LKE transactions are held by the intermediary and are
classified as restricted cash, because the funds must be reinvested in similar properties. If the acquisition of suitable LKE properties is not completed within 180 days of the sale of the Company-owned property, the proceeds are distributed to
Deltic by the intermediary and are reclassified as available cash, and applicable income taxes are determined.Amounts deposited with a third party towards the potential future purchase of property are included in deferred charges and other
assets in the consolidated balance sheets and as an investing activity as changes in funds held by trustee in the consolidated statements of cash flows.The Company had $1,000 of proceeds from land sales deposited with an LKE intermediary at
December31, 2015 and none at December31, 2014.An exchange accommodation titleholder, a type of variable interest entity, is used to facilitate reverse like-kind exchanges.The acquired assets are held by the exchange
accommodation titleholder until the exchange transactions are complete.If the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of the exchange accommodation titleholder, Deltic includes the assets held by the exchange accommodation
titleholder in timber and timberlands assets on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes any income or expense attributed to the property in the consolidated income statements. 
Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets is calculated primarily using the straight-line method. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are
capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals or retirements are recognized in the period they occur. Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the
asset.If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases. 
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met: 1 persuasive
evidence of an agreement exists, 2 delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3 the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable, and 4 collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the
customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. Revenue from the sale of lumber, MDF, and wood by-products is recorded at the time of shipment due to terms of such sale being designated free on board f.o.b.
shipping point. Revenue from consignment sales is recorded when the customer assumes ownership of the product. Revenue from the sale of timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser, which is generally
upon delivery of a legally executed timber deed and receipt of payment for the timber. Revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales, which are made at prices which generally approximate
market within Deltics operating area, are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue from the leasing of land for hunting purposes is deferred when received and
subsequently recognized over the one-year lease term, which begins September1 of each year.At December31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had deferred hunting lease revenue totaling $2,060,000 and $2,009,000, respectively, reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets in deferred revenues and other accrued liabilities.Revenue from mineral lease rental payments is deferred when received and recognized ratably over the lease term.At December31, 2015 and 2014, the
Company had deferred mineral lease revenue of $446,000 and $1,140,000, respectively, of which $115,000 and $383,000 were included in other noncurrent liabilities for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $331,000 and $757,000 were included in other
current liabilities, respectively.Mineral royalty payments are recognized when received. Revenue from sales of timberland and real estate is recorded when the sale is closed and legal title is transferred and the buyers initial and
continuing investment is adequate, which is generally at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the title company handling the closing. 
Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities, based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities,
and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company continuously reviews state and
federal tax returns for uncertain tax provisions.Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are recorded if it is deemed more-likely-than-not that the positions will not be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.These
liabilities are adjusted in the period in which it is determined that the issue is settled with the relevant taxing authority, or there has been an expiration of statute of limitation for a tax year in question, or a change in tax laws, or other
facts become known. Property Taxes Property taxes applicable to the Companys assets are
estimated and accrued in the period of assessment. At December31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had accrued property tax expense totaling $1,932,000 and $1,894,000, respectively, reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in accrued taxes other
than income taxes. Share-Based Compensation The Company applies a fair value-based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees, recognizing the cost as the services are performed. For additional information, see Note 18 Incentive Plans. 
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors both qualified and nonqualified,
noncontributory, defined benefit retirement plans that cover all eligible employees, excluding employees of the subsidiaries. Benefits are based on years of service and final career-average-pay formulas as defined by the plans. The qualified plan is
funded to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for accrued benefits and was frozen to new employees on January1, 2015. The nonqualified plan, a supplemental executive plan, is not funded; payments to retirees due under this plan are made on
a monthly basis. The Company also sponsors a defined benefit health care plan and a life insurance benefit plan for all
eligible retired employees, excluding employees of the subsidiaries.The Company measures the costs of its obligations for these plans based on its health care cost trends and actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, mortality rates,
assumed rates of return, compensation increases, and turnover rates.The Company reviews its assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications 
55 Table of Contents DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2015 
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies cont. 
to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do
so.The effect of modifications to those assumptions is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and amortized to net periodic cost over future periods using the corridor method.The Company believes that the assumptions
utilized in recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on its experience and market conditions. Net
periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn these post- retirement benefits. For additional information, see Note 17 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans. 
Advertising Costs Advertising costs, primarily related to marketing efforts for the Companys real
estate developments, are expensed as incurred. These costs amounted to $784,000 in 2015, $764,000 in 2014, and $716,000 in 2013 and are reflected in the consolidated statements of income. 
Capitalized Interest The Company capitalizes interest for qualifying assets during construction by
applying the Companys capitalization rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. Interest is most often capitalized as an indirect cost for real estate development in the Companys real estate
operations. For additional information, see Note 19 Supplemental Cash Flows Disclosures. 
Timberland Acquisition Expenditures These expenditures are the costs incurred to purchase timber and
timberland, and the costs which are allocated to timber, reforestation, or land are based on various factors such as age and number of trees on the acreage acquired. These expenditures are classified as investing activities in the Companys
consolidated statements of cash flows.  Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures
include additions to investment in real estate held for development and sale; capitalized reforestation costs and logging facilities of timber and timberlands; and property, plant, and equipment. 
Net Change in Purchased Stumpage Inventory Purchased stumpage inventory consists of timber-cutting rights
purchased from third parties specifically for use in the Companys sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and usage of this acquired stumpage inventory, the net change in this inventory can either be a source or use of cash in the
investing activities of the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows. Earnings per Common
Share Basic earnings per share is computed using the two-class method and is based on earnings available to common shareholders less accrued preferred dividends, if any, and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The
diluted earnings per share amounts are computed based on earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including shares assumed to be issued under the Companys stock incentive plans
using the treasury-stock method, unless anti-dilutive. For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share computations, see Note 20 Earnings per Share. 
Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs, such as freight to the customers
destinations, are included in cost of sales in the Companys consolidated statements of income. These costs, when included in the amount invoiced to customers, are also recognized in net sales. 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company evaluates its transactions to determine if any variable
interest entities exist. If it is determined that Deltic is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, that entity is consolidated into Deltics financial statements.

Effect of Recently Issued Authoritative Accounting Guidance
Financial Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue it expects to be entitled to for the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers. This ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company on January1, 2018, and early application is not permitted. The
standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company continues to evaluate the standard and has not yet selected a transition method but believes the standard is expected to have little impact on
its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In April2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest: Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct
deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest: Imputation of Interest Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of
Debt Insurance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. which amended ASU 2015-03 and provided guidance that debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements may be presented in
the balance sheet as assets. The guidance in the new standard is limited to the presentation of debt issuance costs and does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. The new standard is effective on January1, 2016,
and early adoption of this standard is permitted. The Company has elected to adopt this standard on a retrospective basis as of and for the year ended December31, 2015. For additional information, see Note 9 Change in Accounting
Principle. In July 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory Topic 330: Simplifying the Measurement of
Inventory, which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value for entities that do not measure inventory using either the
last-in, first-out LIFO or retail inventory method.The ASU also eliminates the requirement for these entities to consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit
margin when measuring inventory.The update to the standard is effective for the Company on January1, 2017 and is expected to have little impact on its consolidated financialstatements and disclosures. 
In November2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes Topic 740: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,
which requires entities with a classified balance sheet to present all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current. The ASU is effective for the Company on January1, 2017.

Note 4 Business Combinations 
On April1, 2013, the Company acquired the remaining 50 percent membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C.
Del-Tin Fiber for an agreed-upon amount of approximately $20,000,000, which was considered to be comprised of a cash payment of $5,170,000 and the value of 50 percent of the long-term debt. Del-Tin Fiber operates an MDF manufacturing
facility in El Dorado, Arkansas with a rated annual production capacity of 150,000,000 square feet, on a 3/4-inch basis. The acquisition resulted in Deltic obtaining a controlling financial interest in Del-Tin Fiber due to the
Companys 100 percent ownership of the membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber. As a result, Deltic began treating Del-Tin Fiber as a consolidated subsidiary of the Company as of the acquisition date. With this consolidation, on April1,
2013, Deltics Consolidated Balance Sheets included the $29,000,000 of long-term debt of Del-Tin Fiber, which represents the L.L.C.s recorded liability for the outstanding industrial bonds due 2027. This acquisition was consistent with
Deltics strategy of growth through acquisitions and vertical integration, since Del-Tin Fiber uses residual by-products generated by Deltics sawmill operations as the raw material in its manufacturing process. 
Prior to this acquisition the Company owned 50 percent of the membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber and reported it as an equity method
investment.In accordance with ASC 805, Deltic accounted for the acquisition as a business combination achieved in stages.Thus, the Company remeasured the carrying amount of its previously held investment in the joint venture to current
fair value and recorded

a $3,165,000 pretax remeasurement gain, determined by the amount by which the acquisition-date fair value of this investment, of $10,786,000, exceeded its previous carrying amount of $7,621,000.
This gain was included in other income in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December31, 2013. The acquisition date fair value of the Companys existing 50 percent equity interest in Del-Tin Fiber was derived by applying the ownership percentage to the fair value of the net assets of Del-Tin
Fiber. It was determined that no discounting was required, since prior to the acquisition, there was equally shared control of the joint venture by the owning members without specific benefit identified that related to the existence of control. In
addition, Deltic continues to operate the existing facility to produce MDF. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed was determined using a combination of various methodologies, as appropriate, depending on the asset type and classification.Current assets and liabilities were valued at book value, since carrying value approximated fair
value.Property, plant, and equipment assets were valued under various methodologies, including the market approach using comparable sales for real estate and the cost approach discounted for obsolescence for plant and
equipment.Intangible assets were valued using the discounted income approach and using a discount rate of 15 percent.Long-term debt was valued at book value, since it approximated fair value.There was no tax-deductible goodwill as
a result of the Del-Tin Fiber acquisition. The total cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition and is presented in the next table.
The purchase price allocated to the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of
the acquisition date and the calculation of the gain on bargain purchase were as follows:  Thousands of dollars Accounts receivable 4,229 Inventories 4,805 Other current assets 360 Property, plant, and equipment 40,960 Intangible assets1 1,700 Other assets 171 Current liabilities 1,653 Deferred tax liabilities 2,203 Long-term liabilities 29,000

The acquired intangible assets consist of internally developed software which is being amortized over three years. 
The purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of a gain on bargain purchase of approximately $3,413,000, which was included in
the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December31, 2013.The gain on bargain purchase was the result of the fair value of the

identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the purchase price paid for the acquisition.
The seller, Deltics former joint venture partner, was motivated to sell its half of Del-Tin Fiber in order to facilitate the sale of its remaining building products business to a major building products company that had no interest in owning a
membership interest in a joint venture. This sale was part of the former joint venture partners stated plan to divest itself of its building product assets by the end of the year 2013. 
Transaction costs related to the acquisition of Del-Tin Fiber were insignificant and were expensed as incurred.The cash paid to the
seller at the closing of the acquisition was funded by cash on hand. The results of Del-Tin Fibers operations have been
included in the consolidated financial statements subsequent to the acquisition date and were included in the Companys Manufacturing segment. Subsequent to the acquisition date, for the year ended December31, 2013, the Company included
net sales of approximately $47,812,000, from Del-Tin Fiber in its Consolidated Statements of Income. Deltics operating income for the year ended December31, 2013, included $3,068,000 from Del-Tin Fiber operations.

Deltic acquired 514 acres of timberlands located in its current operating area in 2015 when cash payments of $824,000 were paid for 474
acres and 40 acres were acquired in a non-monetary exchange transaction. The Company paid cash of $118,203,000 to acquire 72,170 acres of timberland in 2014 and paid cash of $8,919,000 in 2013 for 7,004 acres. Deltic invests in and holds strategic
fee timber as a productive asset, and any expenditure to acquire such timber and timberlands is an investing activity on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
In 1999, the Company initiated a program to identify and sell non-strategic timberlands and to use the sales proceeds to purchase pine
timberlands that are strategic to its operations.As the Company identifies these acres and determines that they are either smaller tracts of pine timberland that cannot be strategically managed or are tracts of hardwood bottomland that cannot
be converted into pine-growing acreage, they will be sold.As of December31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 250 acres and 655 acres, respectively, were available for sale.Included in the Woodlands operating income are gains from sales
of timberland of $656,000, $857,000, and $1,715,000 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Occasionally Deltic engages in land-for-land exchanges that are recorded as sales due to the nature of the land involved.In 2015, there were
$25,000 of gains from non-monetary exchanges included in operating income, while there were no such exchange gains in 2014 or 2013. Cost of fee timber harvested amounted to $7,110,000, $5,544,000, and $4,494,000 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Depreciation of logging facilities was $98,000, $91,000, and $92,000 for the
years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

building used as the corporate headquarters from a related party for $1,547,000. The final price for this purchase was the result of an arms-length negotiation based on appraisals prepared by separate independent appraisers hired by the Company and
the owner of the building. The purchase is included in the capital expenditures reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

The Company has an agreement with SunTrust Bank together with other banks, which provides an unsecured and committed
revolving credit facility totaling $430,000,000 and includes an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments by $50,000,000, and includes options to request two twelve-month extensions of the facility maturity
date.The credit facility was amended on August25, 2015 to permit Deltic to expand its credit facilities so that the Company could enter into a new $100,000,000 Term Loan Credit Agreement with American AgCredit, PCA as described in Note
11 to the consolidated financial statements.The credit facility had $55,000,000 and $134,000,000, respectively, outstanding and included in long-term debt at December31, 2015 and 2014. As of December31, 2015 and 2014, $375,000,000
and $296,000,000, respectively, were available in excess of all borrowings outstanding under or supported by the respective facilities. Borrowings under the current agreement bear interest at a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an

financial covenants, including a leverage ratio of no greater than 65 to 1, minimum timber market value greater than 175 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness, and limitations on the incurrence of debt. Fees associated with the current
revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 20 to 35 percent per annum on the unused portion of the committed amount. For additional information, see Note 23 Subsequent Events.

The Company has private placement debt outstanding of $40,000,000 of Series A Senior Notes Notes with Pacific Coast Farm
Credit, a division of American AgCredit, due and payable December18, 2016. The interest rate for the Notes has been 610 percent since December18, 2008, and will remain at that rate for the remainder of the term of the Notes. No
installment payments are required, but the terms allow for prepayments at the option of the Company. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a maximum funded debt to capitalization leverage ratio of.65 to 1, and a requirement to maintain a timber market value greater than 175 percent of outstanding total senior indebtedness. An amended agreement for the Notes was made effective December1, 2014. The amended agreement made changes to
certain financial covenants by changing the leverage ratio to be 65 to 1, and the fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated net worth covenants were eliminated. All covenant requirements of the Notes are now the same as for the revolving credit
facility. Deltic entered into a new $100,000,000 ten-year term loan credit agreement the Credit Agreement with
American AgCredit, PCA, effective August27, 2015. The Credit Agreement has a 405 percent fixed rate of interest and a maturity date of August27, 2025. The Credit Agreement has the same financial covenants as those found in the
Companys Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement as amended on August25, 2015. With consolidation
of Del-Tin Fiber into the Companys financial statements on April1, 2013, Deltics long-term debt includes $29,000,000 in Union County, Arkansas Taxable Industrial Revenue Bonds Del-Tin Fiber project 1998 Series due October1,

Bonds under the Loan Agreement and the Lease Agreement with Union County, Arkansas. Fees
associated with the letter of credit included $488,000 in 2015 and $475,000 in 2014 and are included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all amounts owing under the
Bonds to the bondholders. The Companys indebtedness has been presented in these financial statements as though the Company was directly liable for the Bonds. If the Bonds are not remarketed as allowed under the agreement, the letter of credit
and the commitment of the lenders are available to support repayment. Prior to the April1, 2013 acquisition of Del-Tin Fiber, Deltic was a guarantor of one-half of the letter of credit supporting the Bonds. These Bonds bear interest at a
variable rate determined weekly by the remarketing agent of the Bonds. Interest is due on the first business day of the month, and all unpaid interest and all principal is due on October1, 2027. The average interest rate on the Bonds was 28
percent in 2015, 29 percent in 2014, and 38 percent in 2013. As of December31, 2015, the scheduled maturities of
long-term debt for the next five years are $40,000,000 in 2016, none in 2017 or 2018, $55,000,000 in 2019 and none in 2020. For additional information regarding financial instruments, see Note 10 Credit Facilities and Note 14 Fair
Value of Financial Instruments. The table below sets forth the ratio requirements of the covenants in the revolving credit
facility, Senior Notes Payable, and the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the status with respect to these covenants as of December31, 2015 and 2014.

The leverage ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total capital employed.Total debt includes indebtedness for borrowed money, secured
liabilities, obligations in respect of letters of credit, and guarantees.Total capital employed is the sum of total debt and net worth.Net worth is calculated as total assets minus total liabilities, as reflected on the balance
sheet.This covenant is applied at the end of each quarter.  2
Timber market value must be greater than 175 percent of total debt as defined in 1 above. The timber market value is calculated by multiplying the
average price received for sales of timber for the preceding four quarters by the current quarters ending inventory of timber. This covenant is applied at the end of the quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis.

legislation which reduced the maximum income tax rate to 238 percent for the tax year 2016 on timber gains for trees held by the Company for longer than 15 years. Income tax benefits of $192,000 were recognized in 2015 due to the change in income
tax rate applied to the amount of temporary differences expected to be realized in timber gains in 2016.

Net deferred tax assets/liabilities 1,606 985 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, Deltics management considers whether it is
more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the Companys total deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, management believes it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax
assets at December31, 2015, as reductions of future taxable income or by utilizing available tax planning strategies. However, the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of
taxable income are revised. Any liabilities established for unrecognized tax benefits may not be combined with deferred tax assets or liabilities, except when offset by net operating losses.

The Companys policy is to recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in
interest expense and penalties in other expenses. During the third quarter of 2014, the accrued liability balances for interest expense and the penalties related to the uncertain tax liabilities, mentioned above, were reversed and recognized as
reductions to interest expense and an increase in other income, respectively. The Company is no longer subject to federal and state income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2012. 
Note 13 Stockholders Rights Plan 
The Company has a Stockholders Rights Plan Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible common
shareholder to receive a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right a Right for each outstanding share of the Companys common stock held. On October19, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors amended the Rights Plan
to, among other items, extend its term to December31, 2016, and to increase the exercise price of the rights to $200 per share. The Rights will detach from the common stock and become exercisable: 1 following a specified period of time after
the date of the first public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons Acquiring Person has become the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock or 2 following a specified
amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Acquiring Person, which would, if consummated, result in such persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock. In either case, the
detachment of the Rights from the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the Company. The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire

Note 14 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value measurement accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure
fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality.Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices
included in Level 1.Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants.

Information pertaining to the fair value of the pension plan assets is found in Note 17
Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for liabilities
measured at fair value. Nonqualified Employee Savings Plan Consists of mutual funds, which are valued at the net
asset value of shares held by the plan at year-end, at quoted market prices. The fair value measurements for the
Companys financial liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at December31, 2015 are presented in the following table:  Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using December31

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at
December31, 2015 and 2014.The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.The table excludes financial instruments included in
current assets and liabilities, except current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying values. 2015 2014 Thousands of dollars

Note 15 Concentration of Credit Risks 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to credit risk, are trade accounts receivable.These
receivables normally arise from the sale of wood products, MDF, and real estate.Concentration of credit with respect to these trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer
base. No single recurring customer accounted for a significant amount of the Companys sales of wood products, MDF, or real estate in 2015, 2014, or 2013. At December31, 2015, there was one significant accounts receivable of $844,000 from
a single customer and at December31, 2014 there were none. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support accounts receivable.

Note 17 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans 
The Company has a funded, qualified defined benefit retirement plan Retirement Plan that covers each employee of Deltic
Timber Corporation, excluding employees of the subsidiaries, who were employed on December31, 2014 and had completed 1,000 hours of service for a twelve-month period, once employment has commenced, and continues to meet both the 1,000 hours
requirement and the employment requirement for each twelve-month period. Effective December31, 2014, the Retirement Plan was closed to new participants. An unfunded, nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan is maintained for certain
current and former employees. All contributions to both plans are made by the Company. The plans provide defined benefits based on years of benefit service and average monthly compensation as defined by the Companys Retirement Plan. The
Company determines the vested benefit obligation on the actuarial present value based on the employees expected date of retirement. For the December31, 2015 measurement of Deltics defined benefit obligations, the Company selected
the RP-2014 Mortality Tables using Projection Scale MP-2015 as issued by the Society of Actuaries, since it was determined that those rates represented the best estimate of mortality for the participants in the Companys plans. The Company also
sponsors a plan for retired employees, excluding employees of the subsidiaries, that provides comprehensive healthcare benefits supplementing Medicare benefits, for those eligible and life insurance benefits. Costs are accrued for this plan during
the service lives of covered employees. Retirees contribute a portion of the self-funded cost of healthcare benefits and the Company contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life insurance coverage arranged through an insurance
company. The health care plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company retains the right to modify or terminate the benefits and/or cost-sharing provisions.

Note 17 Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans cont. 
The discount rate assumption used by the Company to measure benefit obligations and net
periodic expenses is based on a spot-rate yield curve using current rates of return on high-quality fixed-income investments at the measurement date, reflect the rates at which the pension benefits can be effectively settled and is used to determine
the present value of the expected future cash flows at the measurement date. Additionally, a single rate is determined so that the present value of the benefit obligations using the single rate equals the present value using the spot rate yield
curve. The yield curve only includes bonds that meet the following criteria: 1 have maturities between 6 months and 30 years; 2 are noncallable, nonputable, and do not have a sinking fund provision; 3 have fixed coupon payments with a single
payment at maturity; 4 have more than $250 million par outstanding; 5 are U.S. dollar-denominated bonds; and 6 have an average rating of AA- SP/Fitch or Aa3 Moodys and higher. Any taxable municipal bond, Build
America bonds, or bonds that are issued by any U.S. Government entity that fit under the above criteria are excluded. To
develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption, the Company considered the rates of return of assets the Companys pension plan invested in and compared them to the historical rates of return on investments in similar assets.
Further, these returns were compared to plans of other companies which had similar investment philosophies. After a review of the rate of inflation and its impact, management made the selection of the 750 percent assumption. 
In determining the benefit obligation for health care at December31, 2015, health care inflation cost was assumed to increase at an
annual rate of five percent in 2015.Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plan.A one percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase
the aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit cost for 2015 by $222,000 and the benefit obligation by $2,085,000, while a one percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease the 2015 cost components by $172,000
and the benefit obligation by $1,652,000. Funded Plan The assets of the defined benefit funded
retirement plan the Plan are contained in a trust, sponsored by Deltic, and administered by a trustee appointed by the Companys Pension Investment and Employees Benefits Committee. 
The investment policy of the Plan is to achieve growth with the preservation of principal.To achieve the goal of growth of plan
assets excluding contributions and withdrawals at a rate that exceeds inflation, a balanced portfolio consisting of equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and cash equivalents is maintained.The components of the portfolio should be
securities that have readily available prices and can be sold easily without significantly impacting the price of the securities, with an exception for professionally managed hedge funds.The minimum and maximum asset allocation levels in
total, are equities, 45 to 70 percent, fixed income, 25 to 55 percent, alternative investments, zero to 15 percent, and up to 5 percent in cash equivalents.Further, the total equity minimum and maximum allocation levels at market, for large
cap equity is 40 to 60 percent, mid and small cap equity is 5 to 15 percent, and international equity is zero to 25 percent, with international emerging not to exceed 40 percent of international equities allocation. 
Not more than 25 percent of the market value of Plan assets may be held in the securities of any single issuer with the exception of the
U.S. government or its agencies.As of December31, 2015, less than three percent of the total market value of the Plan assets was invested in collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed security issues.

The following types of securities are permitted in the Plan:  Equities Common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks, convertible bonds, American depository receipts, proprietary funds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded
funds. Fixedincome U.S. government securities, corporate debt obligations, U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed security issues, international bonds, and asset-backed
securities. Cashequivalents U.S. government securities.  Qualified fund of funds limited partnership shares or fund of funds in a mutual fund wrapper.
Fair Value Measurement Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for
retirement plan assets measured at fair value. Common stock, preferred securities, and exchange-traded
funds:Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. 
Mutual funds:Valued at the net asset value NAV of shares held by the Plan at year-end, at quoted market
prices. Alternative investment funds:Valued by company or industry source. 
U.S. treasuries and government agency securities:Valued using quoted prices for similar assets in active markets.
Corporate debt obligations and U.S. government and agency securities:Valued using pricing models that
utilize trade, bid, and other market information; or benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. Money market funds:Valued at par, which approximates fair value.
The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future fair values.Furthermore, while the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial
instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Fair value measurement accounting
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, with Level 1 being the highest quality and Level 3 being the lowest quality.Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets on identical assets or
liabilities.Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1.Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect assumptions about pricing by market participants.

Thrift Plan Employees of the Company and subsidiaries may
participate in its thrift plan by allotting up to a specific percentage of their base pay. The Company matches contributions at a stated percentage of each employees allotment and also provides non-elective contributions. Company contributions
to this plan were $935,000 in 2015, $829,000 in 2014, and $792,000 in 2013. 
Note 18 Incentive Plans 
Stock Incentive Plan On April26, 2012, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to extend the Deltic Timber Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan for ten years to April26,
2022 and change the maximum number of shares which may be awarded in any calendar year as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards to 75,000 shares. The 2002 Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan, which was
terminated. The 2002 Plan permits annual awards of shares of the Companys common stock to executives, other key employees, and nonemployee directors. Under the plan, the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee is
authorized to grant: 1 stock options; 2 restricted stock and restricted stock units; 3 performance units; and 4 other stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. The number of
shares originally registered for issuance under the 2002 Plan was 1,800,000 shares. Additional shares may be issued if an adjustment is determined necessary by the Committee as the result of dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock
split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of common stock, or other corporate transaction in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of benefits or potential benefits
intended to be made available. At December31, 2015, 796,413 of these 1,800,000 shares were available for award under the 2002 Plan. No participant in the 2002 Plan may receive options and stock appreciation rights in any calendar year that
relates to more than 50,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares, which may be awarded as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards, is 75,000 shares. The Company has a policy of issuing treasury stock to satisfy
all share-based incentive plans. Under the fair value recognition provisions for share-based payments, share-based
compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of stock options granted is determined using a binomial model. The fair
value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock performance units are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation cost is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost is to be reported as a financing cash flow. 
Deltic issues restricted stock performance units whose vesting is contingent upon meeting certain financial performance goals based upon
the Companys total stockholder return compared to the total return of a Paper and Forest Products Index selected by the Committee and calculated by Standard and Poors. Determining the appropriate amount to expense is based on likelihood
of achievement of the stated goals and requires judgment, including forecasting future financial results. The expected option
term is based on the term of the option and historical exercise and expiration experience. The Company uses historical volatility over a ten-year trading life to determine weighted expected volatility assumptions. The expected dividend yield is
based on the Companys average dividend yield from 2011 to 2014. Risk-free interest rates are based on historical rates and forward-looking factors. The pre-vesting forfeiture rate is based on past forfeiture rates and expected trends.

approximately $317,000 for timberland acquisitions, $30,632,000 for property, plant, and equipment; and $4,504,000 for investment in real estate held for development and sale. The Company is also involved in litigation incidental to its business from time to time.Currently, there are no material legal proceedings outstanding. 
Note 22 Business Interruption Claim and Gain on Involuntary Conversion of Assets 
On March10, 2015, the Company experienced a fire at its MDF plant located in El Dorado, Arkansas. Damage was
limited to the press portion of the facility and operations at the facility were temporarily suspended while repairs were made to the damaged area. Most of the repairs were completed in April2015 and the plant became fully operational in that
month. The Company maintains insurance coverage for both business interruption and property damage. Deltic settled the insurance claims during the second quarter and recorded the applicable income from the business interruption claim and gains on
involuntary conversion of assets in the operating income section of the consolidated income statement. The claim for business interruption insurance was settled for a total of $2,452,000, of which $516,000 was reported in Other Operating Income in
the Companys Consolidated Statements of Income for the quarter ending June30, 2015 and $1,936,000 was a reimbursement of business operating expenses. The total deductible for the business interruption policy was approximately $948,000,
which was recognized as expense in the first half of 2015. The Company had adequate property damage insurance coverage to enable it to recover the replacement cost of its property and equipment that was destroyed by the fire. During the second
quarter, the Company settled property claims of $5,969,000 for property damage. The claims for property damage included $4,379,000 for inventory, contents, and repair costs, and $1,590,000 for replacement cost of a new press belt and DPA duct. The
total deductible for the property policy was $1,000,000, which was recognized as expense in the first quarter of 2015. After a write-off of basis in the amount of $886,000 for the old press belt and DPA duct in the first quarter of 2015, the Company
recognized a gain from involuntary conversion of assets in the amount of $704,000 which was reported in Other Operating Income in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income for the quarter ending June30, 2015. 
In December of 2012, four lumber storage sheds at the Companys Ola Mill were destroyed due to an accumulation of snow and ice on
their roofs. Insurance policies covered the replacement cost of these sheds, subject to deductibles. The Company received a total of $881,000 in payments from the insurance company for the year ended December31, 2013. These payments were
reported in operating income as a gain on involuntary conversion in the Consolidated Statements of Income and were used to fund capital expenditures to replace the storage sheds. 
Note 23 Subsequent Events 
Effective January 6, 2016, Deltic entered into a second amendment to the Companys Second Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Agreement with the consent of the lenders thereto, in which it exercised the first of its two options and extended the termination date by one year to November17, 2020. 
On February 4, 2016, and pursuant to its Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, Deltic elected to replace two lenders in
the Credit Agreement.Accordingly the respective rights and

obligations of Wells Fargo Bank, NA and Branch Banking and Trust Company were assigned
to one new lender, Greenstone Farm Credit Services, ACA, and one existing lender, American AgCredit, PCA, in the amounts of $27,000,000 and $123,000,000, respectively. On February18, 2016, Deltic Timber Corporation announced that its Board of Directors had authorized management to expand the Companys Common Stock repurchase program by $20,000,000. This
authorization came as the Company had repurchased stock in an amount representing over 90 percent of the previously approved amount in its stock repurchase program. 
Note 24 Business Segments 
The Companys four reporting segments consist of Deltics three operating business units and its corporate
function. Each reporting entity has a separate management team and infrastructure that offers different products or services. 
Woodlands operations manage the Companys Southern Pine timberlands located primarily in Arkansas and north Louisiana and derive
revenue from the harvest of timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans, and either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Companys sawmills for conversion into lumber. In addition, this segment
may, from time to time, identify and sell a portion of its timberland holdings that are either non-strategic to future timberland management activities or that have appreciated, due primarily to location, to a level that exceeds its value as a
timber-growing asset.This segment also generates revenue from oil and gas royalties and the leasing of hunting, oil and gas, and other rights on its timberlands. The Manufacturing segment consists of Deltics two sawmills which convert timber into lumber and Del-Tin Fiber, a plant which converts sawmill residuals and an adhesive bond into MDF. The sawmills
purchase timber from third parties or the Companys Woodlands segment. The MDF plant purchases sawmill residuals from third parties and from the Companys sawmills. The mills produce a variety of products, including dimension lumber,
boards, and timbers, while the MDF plant produces several different grades of MDF. The Manufacturing segments products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors, large retailers, lumber treaters, industrial accounts, and manufacturers in
the South and Midwest and are used in residential construction, roof trusses, remanufactured products, laminated beams, cabinets, flooring, and door parts. The Real Estate operations, which include four real estate developments, add value to former legacy timberland by developing it into upscale, planned residential and commercial developments. These
developments, which are generally centered on a core amenity, are being developed in stages. Historically, real estate sales have consisted primarily of residential lots sold to builders or individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of
undeveloped acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail and office space to third parties in a retail center constructed by the Company, and held for sale, in one of its developments. This segment also manages: 1 a real estate
brokerage subsidiary which generates commission revenue by reselling existing homes and 2 a country club operation, Chenal Country Club, Inc., around which the Companys Chenal Valley development is centered. This club operation derives its
revenues from membership services, food and beverage sales, and membership dues. Corporate operations consist primarily of
senior management, accounting, information systems, human resources, purchasing, treasury, income tax, and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units.The Company currently does not allocate the cost of
maintaining these support functions to its operating units.

Note 24 Business Segments cont. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in
Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on operating income before results of: any equity method investee; interest income and expense; other non-operating income or expense; and
income taxes. Intersegment revenues consist primarily of timber sales from the Woodlands segment to the sawmills operations part of the Manufacturing segment and are transferred at rates that approximate market for the respective operating
area. Information about the Companys business segments consisted of the following: Thousands of dollars

Payment of dividends is the means by which Deltic Timber Corporation makes distributions to its shareholders of profits and cash flows generated by the
Companys business operations. These dividends are declared by the Companys Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. The Companys dividend strategy is to grow the amount of the dividend over time, at a rate of increase that is
believed to be sustainable. The timing and amount of future increases are based on the estimated trend for future earnings and cash flows, taking into account other potential uses of the Companys capital resources including, but not limited
to, acquisition opportunities, capital expenditures for existing operations, debt repayments, and repurchases of the Companys common stock.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders Deltic
Timber Corporation: We have audited Deltic Timber Corporations the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Deltic Timber Corporation maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of

March 4, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ KPMG LLP
