ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF IMATION CORP.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Imation
Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Imation
Corp. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

of these statements. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION BACKGROUND
Imation Corp. the Company became an independent, publicly-held company as of
July 1, 1996 the Distribution Date, when Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
Company 3M spun off its data storage and imaging systems businesses as an
independent, publicly owned company the Distribution. One share of the
Company common stock was issued for every ten shares of 3M stock outstanding
to stockholders of record on June 28, 1996. The Company is a global leader in
the data storage and imaging industries, providing products and services for
data storage, medical imaging, printing and publishing, and photographic
applications. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
SUBSEQUENT TO THE DISTRIBUTION. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts and operations of the Company on a stand-alone basis. 3M and the
Company have entered into a number of agreements to facilitate the transition of
the Company to an independent business enterprise.
PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION. The consolidated financial statements for the periods
prior to July 1, 1996 reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
that were directly related to the Company as it was operated within 3M. Where
assets and liabilities were not specifically identifiable to any particular
business of 3M, only those assets and liabilities transferred to the Company are
included in the Company consolidated balance sheets. Regardless of the
allocation of these assets and liabilities, however, the Company consolidated
statements of operations include all of the related costs of doing business
including an allocation of certain general corporate expenses of 3M which were
not directly related to the Company including costs for corporate logistics,
corporate research and development, information technologies, finance, legal and
corporate executives. These allocations were based on a variety of factors
including, for example, personnel, space, time and effort, and sales volume.
Management believes these allocations were made on a reasonable basis.
Cash and equivalents and debt were not allocated to the Company in the financial
statements as 3M uses a centralized approach to cash management and the
financing of its operations. The consolidated statements of operations include
an allocation of 3M interest expense see Note 7. The Company financing
requirements are represented by cash transactions with 3M and are reflected in
the Net Investment by 3M account see Consolidated Statements of Shareholders'
Equity. Certain assets and liabilities of 3M such as certain employee benefit
and income tax-related balances have not been allocated to the Company and are
included in the Net Investment by 3M account. Activity in the Net Investment by
3M equity account relates to net cash flows of the Company as well as changes in
the assets and liabilities not allocated to the Company.
The Company also participated in 3M centralized interest rate risk management
function. As part of this activity, derivative financial instruments were
utilized to manage risks generally associated with interest rate market
volatility. 3M did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes. 3M was not a party to leveraged derivatives. The consolidated
balance sheets of the Company do not reflect any of the associated asset or
liability positions resulting from this activity because the Company did not
assume any of 3M derivative financial instruments in connection with the
Distribution. The consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash
flows, however, do reflect an allocation of the related gains and losses. Such
gains and losses were recognized by 3M as interest expense over the borrowing
period and, as a result, are reflected in the effective interest rates utilized
by the Company in deriving its interest expense. The minority interest within the consolidated statements of operations gives
recognition to the Company share of net income loss of certain majority
owned subsidiaries of 3M. The minority shareholders' proportionate interests in
the Company net assets of majority owned subsidiaries have not been presented
in the consolidated balance sheets as the Company obtained 100 percent ownership
of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries in connection with the
Distribution.
The financial information included herein for periods prior to the Distribution
may not necessarily be indicative of the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of Company if it had been a separate, independent
company during the periods prior to the Distribution. NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONSOLIDATION. Commencing with the Distribution, the consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned
subsidiaries. Prior to the Distribution, the consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company as described in Note 1. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Principal
areas requiring the use of estimates include: the allocation of financial
statement amounts between the Company and 3M for periods prior to the
Distribution, the determination of allowances for uncollectible accounts
receivable and obsolete/excess inventories, the evaluation of costs associated
with restructuring activities, the determination of certain accrued liabilities,
valuation of certain intangibles, and the assessments of recoverability of
deferred tax assets and certain long-lived assets.
RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years'
financial statements to conform with the current year presentation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY. Local currencies are considered the functional currencies
outside the U.S. except for Imation Europe B.V., the Company European holding
company, and subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies. For
operations in local currency environments, assets and liabilities are translated
at year-end exchange rates with cumulative translation adjustments included as a
component of shareholders' equity. Income and expense items are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. For operations in which
the U.S. dollar is considered the functional currency, certain financial
statement amounts are translated at historical exchange rates, with all other
assets and liabilities translated at year-end exchange rates. These translation
adjustments are reflected in the results of operations. Net foreign currency
exchange losses included in results of operations were $138 million in 1997 and
not material in 1996 and 1995.
The Company will adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. SFAS
130, REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, in 1998. SFAS 130 establishes standards for
the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full
set of general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as
the change in equity during the period of a business enterprise resulting from
non-owner sources. Adjustments to the Company net income to arrive at
comprehensive income principally relate to foreign currency translation
adjustments. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. The Company uses, or may use, interest rate swaps and
foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts to manage risks
generally associated with interest rate, exchange rate and commodity market
volatility. All hedging instruments are designated as, and effective as, hedges
and are highly correlated as required by generally accepted accounting
principles. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to
market with changes recognized currently in the results of operations. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency and commodity
forward and option contracts for qualifying hedge instruments are deferred until
offsetting gains and losses on the underlying transactions are recognized in
earnings. These gains and losses generally are recognized as an adjustment to
cost of goods sold for inventory-related hedge transactions, or as adjustments
to foreign currency transaction gains/losses included in non-operating expenses
for foreign denominated payables- and receivables- related hedge transactions.
For interest rate swaps, the differential paid or received on the swaps is
recognized on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense. Gains and
losses on terminated foreign currency and commodity forward and option contracts
are deferred until the underlying hedged item is recognized in the results of
operations. Gains and losses on terminated interest rate swaps are amortized and
reflected in interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying debt.
Cash flows attributable to these financial instruments are included with cash
flows of the associated hedged items.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. The Company sells a wide range of products and
services to a diversified base of customers around the world and performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition, and therefore
believes there is no material concentration of credit risk.
CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash equivalents consist of temporary investments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying value of cash
equivalents approximates the fair value as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
generally determined on a first-in first-out basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost. Plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Periodic reviews for impairment of the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment are made based on undiscounted expected future cash flows.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and
capitalized software. The Company capitalizes external and internal costs
related to the design and implementation of internally developed software, along
with related interest. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives,
which currently range from five to seven years. The carrying value of intangible
assets are periodically reviewed to assess recoverability based on undiscounted
expected future cash flows.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers
or upon performance of services. Revenues from service contracts are deferred
and recognized over the life of the contracts as service is performed.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. Research and development costs are charged to
expense as incurred.
ADVERTISING COSTS. Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred and
totaled $83 million, $73 million and $52 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. Advertising costs in 1997 and 1996 include $14 million and $22
million, respectively, related to start-up costs for identity development. INCOME TAXES. Upon the Distribution, the Company became responsible for its
income taxes and the filing of its own income tax returns. Prior to the
Distribution, the Company did not file separate tax returns but rather was
included in the income tax returns filed by 3M. For purposes of the Company
consolidated financial statements prior to the Distribution, the Company
allocated share of 3M income tax provision was based on the separate return
method, except that the tax benefit of the Company tax losses in certain
jurisdictions was allocated to the Company on a current basis if such losses
could be utilized by 3M in its tax returns and an assessment of realizability of
certain deferred tax assets was made assuming the availability of future 3M
taxable income. Prior to the Distribution, the balance of accrued current income
taxes for the Company operations is included in the Net Investment by 3M
equity account because 3M paid all taxes and received all tax refunds on the
Company behalf.
TREASURY STOCK. The Company repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded
as treasury stock and are presented as a reduction of shareholders' equity. When
treasury shares are reissued, the Company uses a first-in, first-out method and
the excess of repurchase cost over reissuance price is treated as an adjustment
to retained earnings accumulated deficit.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
using the intrinsic value approach under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. Accordingly, compensation cost for
stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the Company common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock.
EARNINGS PER SHARE. In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE, which specifies the computation,
presentation, and disclosure requirements for earnings per share EPS. SFAS
128 replaces the presentation of primary and fully diluted EPS with basic and
diluted EPS. Basic EPS excludes all dilution and is based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
The Company has adopted SFAS 128, effective December 31, 1997, for periods
subsequent to the Distribution; however, no difference exists between basic and
diluted EPS for the periods presented. For periods prior to the Distribution,
the number of weighted average shares outstanding used in the earnings per share
calculation is one-tenth of the weighted average number of 3M shares outstanding
based on the distribution of one share of the Company for ten shares of 3M
pursuant to the Distribution. NOTE 3 -- ACQUISITIONS
In August 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common shares of
Cemax-Icon, Inc. Cemax for $518 million, consisting of $290 million in
cash net of cash acquired and non-cash amounts consisting of $92 million
representing the Company previous investment in Cemax preferred shares and
$136 million related to the fair value of stock options and warrants to acquire
approximately 971,000 shares of the Company common stock to replace stock
options and warrants previously granted by Cemax. In addition, the Company
issued certain contingent payment rights which allow Cemax shareholders to
receive additional payments of up to $448 million if Cemax attains certain
revenue targets in the twelve month periods ended June 30, 1998 and 1999. At the
election of the Cemax shareholders, the contingent payments are payable in cash
or the Company common stock. Cemax designs, manufactures, and markets medical
imaging and information systems. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The
Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to in-process research and
development projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had
no probable alternative future uses, which resulted in a one-time
non-tax-deductible charge of $417 million. The excess of the initial purchase
price over net assets acquired and in-process research and development of
approximately $177 million was allocated to goodwill and is being amortized
over seven years. Any additional payments pursuant to the contingent payment
rights will be recorded as additional goodwill when the contingencies are met.
Operating results for Cemax are included in the Company results of operations
from the date of acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma summary combines the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and Cemax as if the acquisition had occurred at the
beginning of the years presented after giving effect to certain adjustments,
including amortization of goodwill, increased interest expense on acquisition
debt, and related income tax effects. The pro forma information excludes the
non-recurring charge of $417 million related to purchased in-process research
and development. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the
results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisition
been consummated as of that time.

In October 1996, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common and
preferred shares of Luminous Corporation Luminous for $297 million,
consisting of $103 million in cash and non-cash amounts consisting of $146
million related to the issuance of approximately 923,000 shares of the Company
common stock and $48 million related to the fair value of stock options to
acquire approximately 317,000 shares of the Company common stock to replace
stock options previously granted by Luminous. Luminous is a developer and
marketer of desktop software to the pre-press, print production, printing and
graphic arts industries. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. The Company allocated a portion of the purchase price to
in-process research and development projects that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no probable alternative future uses, which
resulted in a one-time non-tax-deductible charge of $120 million. The Company
has allocated the remaining excess purchase price over net assets acquired to
goodwill which is being amortized over seven years. Operating results for
Luminous are included in the Company results of operations from the date of
acquisition. The pro forma effect on prior periods' results of operations is not
material. NOTE 4 -- SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION In millions                         1997       1996

In late 1995, the Company initiated a review of all of its operations, including
its organizational structure, manufacturing operations, products and markets. In
connection with this review, the Company adopted a reorganization plan to
rationalize its manufacturing operations, streamline its organizational
structure and write-off impaired assets.
The Company reflected pre-tax restructuring and other special charges of $2547
million in its financial statements, partially in 1995 and partially in 1996
based upon the timing recognition criteria required for the restructuring
charges. The Company recorded $1663 million of these charges $883 million
after taxes and minority interest in its 1995 financial statements and an
additional $884 million $606 million after taxes in 1996.
The 1995 restructuring and other special charges of $1663 million includes
$1118 million related to world-wide manufacturing rationalization programs to
exit less profitable manufacturing locations and to centralize manufacturing in
the U.S. and in Italy, and consists principally of write-offs of property, plant
and equipment. This $1118 million charge is included as a separate
restructuring charge in the statement of operations. The remaining 1995 special
charges of $545 million relates primarily to asset write-offs included in cost
of goods sold.
In 1996, restructuring and other special charges of $884 million were recorded.
These charges include $539 million in restructuring charges primarily for
employee separation programs related to the reduction of approximately 1,600
employees and $225 million of special charges associated with start-up
activities which are included in costs of goods sold and selling, general and
administrative expenses. The unpaid restructuring charges for the employee
separation programs as of June 30, 1996, were retained by 3M pursuant to the
Distribution. In addition to the above charges, the Company also recognized a
non-tax-deductible charge of $120 million for the in-process research and
development related to the Luminous acquisition see Note 3.
In 1997, the Company announced plans to further restructure its worldwide
operations in order to improve the Company competitive position, to focus
resources on areas of strength and on growth opportunities, and to reduce costs
and eliminate unnecessary structure. The Company recorded a $1999 million
pre-tax charge $1587 million after taxes to fourth quarter 1997 earnings. The
charge included approximately $1700 million in restructuring charges primarily
associated with employee separation benefits and fixed asset write-offs and
additional special charges of $299 million included in cost of goods sold,
selling, general and administrative expenses, and non-operating expenses,
primarily associated with restructuring-related asset write downs and other
year-end adjustments. Specific planned actions include the restructuring of
European operations, the sale of the CD-ROM business, and the realignment and
reduction of general and administrative, manufacturing, marketing, and selected
research and development areas. The 1997 restructuring charge of $1700 million
consists of $915 million for employee separation related costs, $615 million
for fixed asset write-downs, and $170 million for other business exit costs.
The Company expects the restructuring to result in an additional net reduction
of approximately 1,700 employees worldwide by the end of 1998. The Company
1997 results also include a third quarter non-tax-deductible charge of $417
million for in-process research and development costs related to the Cemax
acquisition see Note 3. NOTE 6 -- INCOME TAXES The components of loss before tax and minority interest are as follows In millions                 1997       1996       1995

international subsidiaries inclusive of earnings prior to the Distribution for
certain international subsidiaries were considered to be permanently invested.
No provision has been made for taxes that might be payable if these earnings
were remitted to the U.S. It is not practical to determine the amount of
incremental tax that might arise if these earnings were to be remitted.
Cash paid for income taxes in 1997 was $109 million and was not material for
the period from July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996. Prior to July 1, 1996, 3M
paid all taxes and received all tax refunds on the Company behalf. NOTE 7 -- DEBT

The Company maintains a $350 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate
of banks which expires June 30, 2001 the Credit Agreement. The commitment fee
for the credit facility is based on the Company interest coverage ratio, and
as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, was 25 and 15 of one percent on the total
amount of the credit facility, respectively. Borrowings under the credit
facility bear interest based on the London interbank offered rate LIBOR or the
administrative agent bank base rate, plus an applicable margin based on the
Company interest coverage ratio. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, $313
million and $120 million in borrowings under this credit facility were
outstanding, respectively, at interest rates ranging from 649% to 655% and
580% to 586%, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains financial covenants
that include a maximum debt to capital ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio,
and a minimum tangible net worth and contains a Material Adverse Change MAC
provision.
As a result of the Company restructuring plans and the restructuring and other
special charges recorded by the Company in its 1997 consolidated financial
statements, as of December 31, 1997, the Company was not in compliance with
certain of its financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. In
December 1997, the Company obtained a limited waiver from the lenders who are
parties to the Credit Agreement under which the lenders agreed to waive
compliance by the Company with the financial covenants contained in the Credit
Agreement during the period from December 17, 1997 to March 30, 1998. On March
30, 1998, the Company entered into a Limited Waiver and Amendment to its Credit
Agreement which provides an extension through January 5, 1999 of the limited
waiver granted in December 1997. During the extended waiver period, borrowings
under the Credit Agreement will be collateralized by substantially all of the
Company assets and the Company will be required to maintain a specified
minimum level of earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization
EBITDA. The Company will also incur certain fees and increased interest rates
on outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement during the extended waiver
period. The Credit Agreement also contains a number of provisions restricting
the Company ability to take certain actions, including the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, the creation of additional liens, the making of certain
restricted payments and the sale of substantial assets of the Company. It also
contains certain ongoing reporting requirements, including computations 
regarding the Company financial condition, absence of events of defaults and
absence of material adverse changes in the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company. Long-term debt maturities are as follows In millions            1998   1999  2000   2001  Total
- 
Long-term debt maturities      $09  $ 28  $39   $3130 $3206 Short-term debt as of December 31, 1997, consisted of $304 million of
uncollateralized borrowings primarily held by international subsidiaries. These
borrowings have original maturities of one year or less and have a weighted
average interest rate of 34% and 29% as of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. As of December 31, 1997, the Company had an additional $444
million available under credit facilities held by various subsidiaries outside
the U.S.
The Company estimates that the fair value of short-term and long-term debt
approximates the carrying amount of debt as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.
The Company interest expense for 1997 was $157 million net of $25 million
capitalized and for the period from July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996 was $68
million. Cash paid for interest in these periods was $132 million and $62
million, respectively. Prior to the Distribution, the Company financial
statements include allocations of 3M interest expense totaling $74 million
for the period from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 1996, and $188 million for
1995. Allocations prior to the Distribution were based on an assumed non-ESOP
debt level of $250 million. The interest rates used were 64% and 75% in 1996
and 1995, respectively, which reflect 3M weighted average effective interest
rates on non-ESOP debt during these periods. The consolidated balance sheet of
the Company prior to the Distribution does not include this debt as the total
capitalization of the Company was reflected in the Net Investment by 3M equity
account. NOTE 8 -- FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
To manage interest rate risk, the Company has entered into an interest rate swap
agreement with a financial institution effective March 25, 1997, which expires
March 31, 2000. This notional amount of the interest rate swap agreement is $100
million with the Company paying a fixed rate of 663% and receiving a variable
rate based on LIBOR. The notional amount serves solely as a basis for the
calculation of interest payment streams to be exchanged and is not a measure of
the exposure to the Company through its use of such derivative.
To manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and silver
market volatility, the Company has entered into foreign currency and commodity
forward and option contracts. These contracts generally have maturities of less
than six months. The face amount of forward and options contracts as of December
31, 1997 and 1996 are as follows In millions                     1997        1996
- 
Foreign currency forward contracts          $939       $285
Foreign currency option contracts purchased      18         -
Silver commodity forwards contracts          84        34
- 
The carrying and fair value of the interest rate swap and foreign currency and
commodity forward and option contracts are not material as of December 31, 1997
and 1996.
The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by
counter-parties in interest rate swaps, and foreign currency and commodity
forward and option contracts, but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of
these counter-parties. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk
through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major
international banks and financial institutions as counter-parties. NOTE 9 -- LEASES
In March 1997, the Company entered into a Master Lease and Security Agreement in
connection with the construction of a new research and development facility at
the Company headquarters site. Construction is expected to be completed in
June 1998, at which time the lease payments will commence. The Company has the
option to purchase the facility at the end of the lease term, March 2002. In the
event the Company chooses not to exercise this purchase option, the Company is
obligated to arrange for the sale of the facility and has guaranteed the lessor
a sale price of $585 million.
Rent expense under operating leases, which primarily relate to equipment and
office space, amounted to $235 million, $151 million and $90 million in
1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The following table sets forth the minimum
rental payments under operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of
one year as of December 31, 1997 and under the Master Lease and Security

The Company maintains a shareholder rights plan under which the Company has
issued one preferred share purchase right Right for each common share of the
Company. Each Right will entitle its holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of
$125, subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable only if a person or
group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Company
outstanding common stock. The Rights expire on July 1, 2006 and may be redeemed
earlier by the Board of Directors for $001 per Right.
In connection with the acquisition of Cemax, the Company assumed certain
outstanding warrants on Cemax stock which the Company agreed to convert into
warrants to acquire 93,375 shares of the Company common stock. The warrants
have an exercise price of $2077 and became exercisable upon the acquisition of
Cemax by the Company. NOTE 11 -- SEGMENT INFORMATION

Effective with year-end 1998 reporting, the Company will adopt SFAS 131,
DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION. SFAS 131
establishes standards for the reporting of operating segment information in both
annual reports and interim financial reports issued to shareholders. The Company
is reviewing the requirements of SFAS 131 but has not yet determined what
segment information will be reported upon adoption. The Company believes that it
may be required to present segment information beyond the one segment currently
presented. NOTE 12 -- RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company has various non-contributory defined benefit employee pension plans
covering substantially all U.S. employees and certain employees outside the U.S.
For the U.S. plan, employees are eligible to participate at date of hire and are
fully vested after five years of service, including pension service time while
employed by 3M. Benefits are based primarily on employees' annual salary and
annual interest credits. For plans outside the U.S., benefits are based
principally on years of service and compensation near retirement. The Company
funding policy is to deposit with a trustee amounts at least equal to those
required by law. Pension investments consist primarily of common stocks and
fixed-income securities.
Prior to the Distribution, employees of the Company participated in various
3M-sponsored retirement plans. For U.S. employees, 3M has retained
responsibility for the benefits earned under the 3M plan prior to the
Distribution. For plans outside the U.S., the Company generally has assumed the
assets and related liabilities. For periods prior to the Distribution, pension
expense was allocated to the Company as part of 3M. Allocated pension expense
was $120 million in the period from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 1996, and $240
million in 1995. Total pension expense was $200 million, $213 million and
$240 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

determined using the assumptions as of year end.
In addition to the above, the Company Italian subsidiary sponsors an employee
severance indemnity plan as required by law. The accrued liability for this
severance indemnity plan is included in other liabilities and was $393 million
and $493 million as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company
measures the vested benefit obligation as the amount that would be payable if
the employees under the plan would separate currently. Expense for this plan was
$47 million, $50 million and $78 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. NOTE 13 -- EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS
The Company sponsors a 401k retirement savings plan under which eligible U.S.
employees may choose to save up to 15% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax
basis, subject to certain IRS limitations. The Company matches employee
contributions 100% on the first three percent of eligible compensation and 25%
on the next three percent of eligible compensation. The Company also sponsors a
variable compensation program, in which the Company will contribute up to three
percent of eligible employee compensation to employees' 401k retirement
accounts, depending upon Company performance.
The Company established an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP during 1996 as a
cost-effective way of funding the employee retirement savings benefits noted
above. The ESOP borrowed $500 million from the Company in 1996 and used the
proceeds to purchase approximately 22 million shares of the Company common
stock, with the ESOP shares pledged as collateral for the debt. The Company
makes monthly contributions to the ESOP equal to the debt service plus an
applicable amount so that the total contribution releases a number of shares
equal to that required to satisfy the Company matching requirements. As the
debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to employee
accounts. The shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares
in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company reports compensation expense
equal to the current market price of the shares released, and released shares
are considered outstanding for the computation of earnings per share. Total
compensation expense related to the ESOP was $85 million in 1997 and $51
million in the period from July 1, 1996 to December 31, 1996.
The ESOP shares as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, are as follows                                1997         1996

Prior to July 1, 1996, U.S. employees of the Company participated in a
3M-sponsored employee savings plan under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue
Code. 3M matched employee contributions of up to six percent of compensation at
rates ranging from 35 to 85 percent depending upon financial performance. The
Company allocation of the expense related to the 3M employee savings plan was
$23 million in the period from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 1996, and $45
million in 1995. Total expense related to employee savings and stock ownership
plans was $85 million, $74 million and $45 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. NOTE 14 -- EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS
The Company currently has stock options outstanding under the Imation 1996
Employee Stock Incentive Program the Employee Plan, the Imation 1996
Directors Stock Compensation Program the Directors Plan, the Imation Stock
Option Plan for Employees of Luminous Technology Corporation the Luminous
Plan and the Imation Stock Option Plan for Employees of Cemax-Icon Corp. the
Cemax Plan.
The Employee Plan was approved and adopted by 3M on June 18, 1996, as the sole
shareholder of the Company, and became effective on July 1, 1996, at
Distribution. The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued or
awarded under the Employee Plan may not exceed 6,000,000. All shares subject to
awards under the Employee Plan that are forfeited or terminated will be
available again for issuance pursuant to awards under the Employee Plan. Grant
prices are equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock at date
of grant. The options normally have a term of ten years and generally become
exercisable from one to five years after grant date. At December 31, 1997 and
1996, there were 1,915,170 and 3,677,352 shares available for grant under the
Employee Plan, respectively.
The Directors Plan was also approved and adopted by 3M prior to the
Distribution, as the sole shareholder of the Company, and became effective on
July 1, 1996. The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued or
awarded under the Directors Plan may not exceed 800,000. The outstanding options
are non-qualified options with a term of ten years and generally become
exercisable one year after grant date. Grant prices are equal to the fair market
value of the Company common stock at date of grant. As of December 31, 1997
and 1996, there were 676,750 and 740,000 shares available for grant under the
Directors Plan, respectively.
The Luminous Plan was approved and adopted by the shareholders of Luminous prior
to the acquisition of Luminous by the Company see Note 3. In connection with
the acquisition, the Company assumed certain obligations pursuant to outstanding
stock options held by Luminous employees and agreed to convert such options into
options to purchase 317,062 shares of the Company common stock. The
outstanding options were amended to accelerate the dates on which the options
become exercisable. No additional grants may be made pursuant to the Luminous
Plan.
The Cemax Plan was approved and adopted by the shareholders of Cemax prior to
the acquisition of Cemax by the Company see Note 3. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company assumed certain obligations pursuant to outstanding
stock options held by Cemax employees and agreed to convert such options into
options to purchase 877,554 shares of the Company common stock. The
outstanding options were amended to accelerate the dates on which the options
become exercisable. No additional grants may be made pursuant to the Cemax Plan.

for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
recognized for the stock option plans. If the fair value of options granted had
been recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting periods in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, pro forma pre-tax
loss would have been $160 million higher $98 million after taxes or $023 per
Basic and Diluted share for 1997, $94 million higher $51 million after taxes
or $012 per Basic and Diluted share in 1996 and $34 million higher $19
million after taxes or $005 per Basic and Diluted share in 1995.
The weighted average fair value at date of grant for options granted by the
Company in 1997 and 1996 are as follows                              1997     1996

Exercise price less than market price on grant date:    $1771   $ 2197
As part of 3M, certain employees of the Company were granted stock options prior
to the Distribution to purchase 3M stock. Options granted to the Company
employees under 3M General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan GESPP were for
72,522 shares in the period from January 1, 1996 to June 30, 1996 and 144,366
shares in 1995. The weighted average fair value per option granted under the
GESPP was $1037 in 1996 and $860 in 1995. Options granted to the Company
employees under 3M Management Stock Option Plan MSOP were for 271,200 shares
in 1995 with a weighted average fair value of $1248 per option. No options were
issued to the Company employees under the MSOP in 1996. Pursuant to the
Distribution, options granted to the Company employees while part of 3M have
not been converted into options to purchase shares of the Company stock.
The fair values at date of grant were estimated using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions 1995 grants

Pursuant to the Distribution on July 1, 1996, certain assets and liabilities
with a net value of $81 million were retained by 3M, primarily comprised of
certain deferred tax assets of $269 million and severance obligations of $239
million. Non-cash items related to acquisitions are described in Note 3. NOTE 16 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
In connection with the Distribution, the Company assumed substantially all
liabilities for legal proceedings relating to the Company businesses as
conducted prior to the Distribution.
The Company is the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions and
other claims, including proceedings under laws and regulations related to
environmental and other matters, in the ordinary course of its business. All
such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not
predictable with assurance. Consequently, the Company is unable to ascertain as
of December 31, 1997 the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or
financial impact that may be incurred by the Company with respect to these
matters. While these matters could materially affect operating results of any
one quarter when resolved in future periods, it is management opinion that
after final disposition, any monetary liability or financial impact to the
Company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 1997 would not be material to the Company financial position, annual
results of operations or cash flows.
In addition, on December 2, 1997 Eastman Kodak Company Kodak filed a civil
complaint against the Company, 3M and certain of their respective subsidiaries
in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. The complaint
alleges improper receipt of Kodak trade secrets by 3M Italian subsidiaries
between 1993 and May 1996 from Harold Worden, a retired Kodak employee. Worden
has since pleaded guilty and been sentenced in the Western District of New York
on criminal charges of interstate transportation of stolen Kodak documents. The
3M subsidiaries that dealt with Worden became subsidiaries of the Company in
connection with the Distribution. In its complaint, Kodak seeks unspecified
compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages and permanent injunctive
relief.
On December 2, 1997 the Company, 3M and their respective subsidiaries filed a
suit in Italy asking the Italian Court to declare that they have no liability to
Kodak in this matter. On February 6, 1998 the Company and 3M filed a request
that the Court dismiss the action on grounds that it is properly venued in
Italy, as well as on grounds of legal flaws in Kodak claims. The motion to
dismiss is scheduled to be heard by the Court on May 7, 1998, with a decision
regarding the dismissal expected in early summer 1998. It is not possible at
this time to reach any conclusions as to the outcome of this litigation. The
Company disputes any liability to Kodak and intends to vigorously defend the
action. NOTE 17 -- QUARTERLY DATA UNAUDITED In millions,
