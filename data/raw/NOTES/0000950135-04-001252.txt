Item8 for further detail of accrued expenses and accounts
payable. 33 Table of Contents Cash used in investing activities during 2003
totaled $2128million, compared to $1416million
2002. The increase primarily results from an increase in
purchases of marketable securities, net of sales, as a direct
result of our strategy to invest more of our cash balance in
order to achieve greater rates of return. Cash provided by used in financing activities
of $07million in 2003, compared to $1184million
in 2002. The decrease primarily results from a change in
proceeds from issuance of common stock from 2003 to 2002. In
2002, we completed a follow-on public offering of 20,000,000
shares of common stock, with net proceeds of
$3977million, of which there is no comparable amount in
2003. This was mostly offset by our 2003 issuance of long-term
debt in 2003 for $3000million, of which there is no
comparable amount in 2002. The following table below summarizes our
significant contractual obligations as of December28, 2003
and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our
liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

In addition to the above, the company also has
obligation under Korean law to pay lump-sum payments to
employees upon termination of their employment see Note8
of Item8 for further detail. This retirement liability
was $124million as of December28, 2003.

The company also has obligations for variable
rate interest payments in conjunction with the credit facility
see Note 4 of Item 8 for further detail.

Capital purchase obligations represent
commitments for purchase of plant and equipment. They are not
recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of
December28, 2003, as we have not yet received the related
goods or taken title to the property.
5
For the purposes of this table, contractual
obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as
agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on the
company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed
or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or
variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the
transaction. Our purchase orders are based on our current
manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within
short time horizons.
6
Total does not include contractual obligations
recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities other than
debt obligations, or certain purchase obligations as discussed
below.
It is customary practice in the semiconductor
industry to enter into guaranteed purchase commitments or
take or pay arrangements for purchases of certain
equipment and raw materials. Obligations under these
arrangements are included in 5 above. We also enter into contracts for outsourced
services; however, the obligations under these contracts were
not significant at December28, 2003 and the contracts
generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without
significant penalty. 34 Table of Contents The expected timing of payment of the obligations
discussed above is estimated based on current information.
Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different
depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes
to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Liquidity and Capital Resources of Fairchild
International, Excluding Subsidiaries Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. is a
holding company, the principal asset of which is the stock of
its sole subsidiary, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation.
Fairchild Semiconductor International on a stand-alone basis had
no cash flow from operations and has no cash requirements for
the next twelve months. Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The preparation of these financial statements
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has defined critical
accounting policies as those that are both most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results and which
require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or
estimates. Based on this definition, we believe our critical
accounting policies include the policies of revenue recognition,
sales reserves, inventory valuation, the impairment of
long-lived assets and income taxes. For all financial statement
periods presented, there have been no material modifications to
the application of these critical accounting policies. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the judgments
and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies,
including those related to revenue recognition, sales reserves,
inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets and income
taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Materially different results in the amount and timing of our
actual results for any period could occur if our management made
different judgments or utilized different estimates. Revenue Recognition and Sales
Reserves. No revenue is recognized
unless there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the price
to the buyer is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and
collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue
from the sale of semiconductor products is recognized when title
and risk of loss transfers to the customer, which is generally
when the product is shipped to the customer from our facility.
We also receive revenues from manufacturing wafers under
contracts with other semiconductor suppliers, such as National
Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics, who have sold us their
wafer manufacturing facilities and require a continued source of
wafer supply after the sales. Contract manufacturing revenue is
recorded at the time title to the wafer and risk of loss passes
to the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria
have been satisfied. Shipping costs billed to our customers are
included within revenue. Associated costs are classified in cost
of goods sold. Approximately 63% of the companys revenues
are sold through distributors. Distributor payments are not
contingent upon resale or any other matter other than the
passage of time. The company has agreements with some
distributors and customers for various programs, including
prompt payment discounts, pricing protection, scrap allowances
and stock rotation. In general, credits allowed under these
programs are capped based upon individual distributor
agreements. The company records charges associated with these
programs as a reduction of revenue based upon historical
activity. The companys policy is to use a three to six
month rolling historical experience rate in order to estimate
the necessary allowance to be recorded. In addition, the
products sold by the company are subject to a limited product
quality warranty. The company accrues for estimated incurred but
unidentified quality issues based upon historical activity and
known quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably
estimated. The standard limited warranty period is one year.
Quality returns are accounted for as a reduction of revenue.
Historically, we have not experienced material differences
between our estimated sales reserves and actual results. 35 Table of Contents In some cases, title and risk of loss do not pass
to the customer when the product is shipped from our facility.
In these cases, the company recognizes revenue at the time when
title and risk of loss is transferred, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. These cases
include several inventory locations where we manage the
inventory for our customers, some of which are at customer
facilities. In such cases, revenue is not recognized when
products are shipped to these locations; rather, revenue is
recognized when customers take the inventory from the location
for their use. Inventory Valuation.
In determining the net realizable value of our inventories, we
review the valuations of inventory considered excessively old,
and therefore subject to, obsolescence and inventory in excess
of customer backlog. We also adjust the valuation of inventory
when estimated actual cost is significantly different than
standard cost and to value inventory at the lower of cost or
market. Once established, write-downs of inventory are
considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory. Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets. We assess the impairment of
long-lived assets, including goodwill, on an ongoing basis and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. In conjunction with the implementation of the new
accounting rules for goodwill as of the beginning of 2002, we
completed a goodwill impairment review for the reporting units
that have goodwill associated with them. We also performed an
annually required review during the fourth quarter of 2003, and
in both reviews we found no impairment. We will perform a similar review annually, or
more frequently, if indicators of potential impairment arise.
Our impairment review process is based upon a discounted cash
flow analysis, which uses our estimates of revenues, driven by
market growth rates and estimated costs, as well as utilizing a
discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate
with our cost of capital and the risk inherent in our current
business model. For all other long-lived assets, our impairment
review process is based upon an estimate of future undiscounted
cash flows. Factors we consider that could trigger an impairment
review include the following   
significant underperformance relative to expected
historical or projected future operating results,
significant changes in the manner of our use of
the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business,
significant negative industry or economic trends,
and
significant technological changes, which would
render equipment and manufacturing process, obsolete.
Recoverability of assets that will continue to be
used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying
value to the future undiscounted cash flows. Future undiscounted
cash flows include estimates of future revenues, driven by
market growth rates, and estimated future costs. Income Taxes. We
make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax
assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is
based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will
generate sufficient future taxable income in certain
jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. This
likelihood is supported by tax planning strategies available to
the company that are both prudent and feasible. These strategies
would be implemented to preserve the deferred tax asset. A
valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets
which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria
established by SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may
change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws,
or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our
estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we
have established may be increased, resulting in increased income
tax expense. Conversely, if we are ultimately able to utilize
all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a
valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of
the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit
to income tax expense. In addition, the calculation of our tax
liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of
jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for
anticipated tax 36 Table of Contents audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent
to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these
amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the
liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the
period when we determine the liabilities are no longer
necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would
result. Forward Looking Statements This annual report includes forward-looking
statements as that term is defined in Section21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such
as we believe, we expect, we
intend, may, will,
should, seeks,
approximately, plans,
estimates, anticipates, or
hopeful, or the negative of those terms or other
comparable terms, or by discussions of our strategy, plans or
future performance. For example, the Outlook section below
contains numerous forward-looking statements. All
forward-looking statements in this report are made based on
managements current expectations and estimates, which
involve risks and uncertainties, including those described below
and more specifically in the Business Risks section below. Among
these factors are the following: changes in regional or global
economic or political conditions including as a result of
terrorist attacks and responses to them; changes in demand for
our products; changes in inventories at our customers and
distributors; technological and product development risks;
availability of manufacturing capacity; availability of raw
materials; competitors actions; loss of key customers;
order cancellations or reduced bookings; changes in
manufacturing yields or output; and significant litigation.
Factors that may affect our operating results are described in
the Business Risks section in the quarterly and annual reports
we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such risks
and uncertainties could cause actual results to be materially
different from those in the forward-looking statements. Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking
statements. Policy on Business Outlook Disclosure and
Quiet Periods It is our current policy to update our business
outlook at least twice each quarter. The first update is near
the beginning of each quarter, within the press release that
announces the previous quarters results. The business
outlook below is consistent with the outlook included in our
January15, 2004 press release announcing fourth quarter
and full year 2003 results, as updated in a press release dated
March2, 2004. The second update is within a press release
issued approximately two months into each quarter. The current
business outlook is accessible at the Investor Relations section
of our website at 
Toward the end of each quarter, and until that quarters
results are publicly announced, we observe a quiet
period, when the outlook is not updated to reflect
managements current expectations. The quiet period for the
first quarter of 2004 will be from March13, 2004 to
April15, 2004, when we plan to release our first quarter
2004 results. Except during quiet periods, the business outlook
posted on our website reflects current guidance unless and until
updated through a press release, SEC filing or other public
announcement. During quiet periods, our business outlook, as
posted on our website, announced in press releases and provided
in quarterly, annual and special reports or other filing with
the SEC, should be considered to be historical, speaking as of
prior to the quiet period only and not subject to update by the
company. During quiet periods, Fairchild Semiconductor
representatives will not comment about the business outlook of
the companys financial results or expectations. Outlook For the first quarter of 2004, we expect an
increase in revenues of approximately 3% to 5% over the fourth
quarter. We had roughly 90% of this amount already on backlog as
we entered the first quarter, which is significantly better than
what we would expect in the first quarter, as first quarter
revenues are typically seasonally lower than the fourth quarter.
We expect gross profits to increase roughly 100 basis points
sequentially, due to better product mix, lower costs, and a more
favorable pricing environment. We also expect research and development and
selling, general and administrative expenses to be roughly flat
as a percent of revenue to first quarter 2003 levels. We expect
amortization of acquisition-related 37 Table of Contents intangibles to be approximately
$77million. For 2004, we continue to plan capital
expenditures of approximately 8-10% of revenue, with a higher
percentage in the first half of the year to accelerate the
addition of capacity, primarily to support power discrete
products. Recently Issued Financial Accounting
Standards In December 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASBissued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFASNo132 Revised 2003
Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits, which enhanced the disclosure about
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, but did
not change the measurement or recognition principles for those
plans. The statement requires additional disclosures about the
assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost
of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit
postretirement plans. The adoption of SFAS No132 is not
expected to have a material affect on the consolidated financial
statements. In May 2003, the consensus on Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF Issue No01-08
Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease was
issued. The guidance in the consensus applies to the purchase or
sale of goods and services under various types of contracts,
including outsourcing arrangements. Based on the criteria in the
consensus, both parties of an arrangement are required to
determine whether the arrangement includes a lease within the
scope of SFAS No13. The new requirement applies
prospectively to new or modified arrangements for reporting
periods beginning after May28, 2003. Accordingly, as of
July1, 2003, the company accounts for new or modified
arrangements based on this guidance. Adoption of this standard
did not have a material impact on the companys results of
operations. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This
statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and
measures in its statement of financial position certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities
and equity. In accordance with the standard, financial
instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required
to be classified as liabilities. SFAS No150 is effective
for financial instruments entered into or modified after
May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning
of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003.
SFAS No150 did not have an impact on our results of
operations or financial position. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No149,
Amendment of Statement133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. The purpose of SFAS No149 is to
amend and clarify financial accounting and reporting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities under SFAS
No133. SFAS No149 amends SFAS No133 for
decisions made: ias part of the Derivatives
Implementation Group process that require amendment to SFAS
No133, iiin connection with other FASB projects
dealing with financial instruments, and iiiin connection
with the implementation issues raised related to the application
of the definition of a derivative. SFAS No149 is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June30, 2003 and for designated hedging relationships
after June30, 2003. SFAS No149 did not have an
impact on the companys results of operations or financial
position. In January 2003, FASB Interpretation No46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARBNo51 was issued, and in
December 2003, a revision to Interpretation No46 was
issued. Interpretation No46 requires identification of
the companys participation in variable interest annuities
VIEs, which are defined as entities with a level of
invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities
to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose
equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling
financial interest. For entities identified as VIEs,
Interpretation No46 sets forth a model to evaluate
potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to
VIEs if any, bears a majority of the risk to its expected
losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected
returns. Interpretation 46 also sets forth certain disclosures
regarding interests in VIEs that are deemed significant,
even if consolidation is not required. This interpretation is
effective for all VIEs created after January31,
2003. The adoption of the interpretation during 2003 did not
have an impact on our results of operations or financial
position. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an 38 Table of Contents Interpretation of FASB No5, 57,
and107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation
No34, was issued. FIN
No45 clarifies requirements relating to the
guarantors accounting for, and disclosure of, the issuance
of certain types of guarantees. FIN No45 requires that
upon issuance of a guarantee, companies recognize a liability
for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that
guarantee. The adoption of FIN No45 did not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2002, the Task Force reached a
consensus on EITF IssueNo00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Issue00-21
addresses when an arrangement with multiple deliverables should
be divided into separate units of accounting. The impact of
adopting EITF IssueNo00-21 did not have a material
impact on our financial statements. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. SFAS No146 requires companies to
recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when
they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an
exit or disposal plan. This statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December31, 2002. See Note11
of ItemNo8 for the effect of the companys
adoption of SFAS No146 on the companys consolidated
financial statements. Item7A.Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to financial market risks,
including changes in interest rates and foreign currency
exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative
financial instruments. We do not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. All of the
potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses
performed on our financial position at December28, 2003.
Actual results may differ materially. We use currency forward and combination option
contracts to hedge firm commitments and currency option
contracts to hedge anticipated transactions. Beginning in 2001,
similar instruments were also used to hedge a portion of our
forecasted foreign exchange denominated revenues. Gains and
losses on these foreign currency exposures would generally be
offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging
instruments, resulting in negligible net exposure to us. A
majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing
activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we do
conduct these activities by way of transactions denominated in
other currencies, primarily the Korean won, Malaysian ringgit,
Philippine peso, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, British pound, and
the Euro. Exposures in the Korean won are minimal as
won-denominated revenues and costs approximately offset one
another. To protect against reductions in value and the
volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in other
foreign exchange rates, we have established hedging programs. We
utilize currency forward contracts and currency option contracts
in these hedging programs. Our hedging programs reduce, but do
not always entirely eliminate, the short-term impact of foreign
currency exchange rate movements. For example, during the twelve
months ended December28, 2003, an adverse change in any
one exchange rate defined as 20% over the course of the year
would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes
of less than $5million. We have no interest rate exposure due to rate
changes for the 101/2% Senior Subordinated Notes or the 5%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes. However, we do have
interest rate exposure with respect to the senior credit
facility due to the variable LIBOR pricing for both the term
loan and the revolving credit facility. For example, a
50basis point increase in interest rates would result in
increased annual interest expense of $09million for the
revolving credit facility, assuming all borrowing capability was
utilized. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would
result in increased annual interest expense of $15million
for the term loan. There was no outstanding balance on the
revolving credit facility at December28, 2003 or at any
point during 2003. From time to time, we may enter into interest
rate swaps or interest rate caps, primarily to reduce interest
rate exposure. As of December28, 2003, we had no such
instruments in place. 39 Table of Contents Item8.Consolidated

40 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc.
and subsidiaries the company as of
December28, 2003 and December29, 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, comprehensive loss and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended
December28, 2003. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the accompanying financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the company as of
December28, 2003 and December29, 2002 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective December31, 2001, the
company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Note1 Background and Basis
of Presentation Background Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc.
Fairchild International or the company
designs, develops and markets analog, interface, discrete,
standard logic, non-volatile memory and optoelectronic
semiconductors through its wholly-owned subsidiary Fairchild
Semiconductor Corporation Fairchild. The company
is focused primarily on power analog and discrete products used
directly in power applications such as voltage conversion, power
regulation, power distribution and power and battery management.
Our products are building block components for virtually all
electronic devices, from sophisticated computers and internet
hardware to telecommunications equipment to household
appliances. Because of their basic functionality, these products
provide customers with greater design flexibility and improve
the performance of more complex devices or systems. Given such
characteristics, its products have a wide range of applications
and are sold to customers in the personal computer, industrial,
communications, consumer electronics and automotive markets.
During 2003, we announced our intention to exit the non-volatile
memory business, and expect to complete this process in the
first half of 2004. The company is headquartered in South Portland,
Maine and has manufacturing operations in South Portland, Maine,
Loveland and Colorado Springs, Colorado, West Jordan, Utah,
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania, Cebu, the Philippines, Penang,
Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Singapore, Bucheon, South
Korea, Wuxi and Suzhou, China. Note2 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Fiscal Year The companys fiscal year ends on the last
Sunday in December. The companys results for the years
ended December28, 2003, December29, 2002 and
December30, 2001 each consist of 52weeks. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. Revenue Recognition No revenue is recognized unless there is
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the price to the buyer is
fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectibility
of the sales price is reasonably assured. Revenue from the sale
of semiconductor products is recognized when title and risk of
loss transfers to the customer, which is generally when the
product is shipped to the customer from our facilities. We also
receive revenues from manufacturing wafers under contracts with
other semiconductor suppliers, such as National Semiconductor
and Samsung Electronics, who have sold us their wafer
manufacturing facilities and require a continued source of wafer
supply after the sales. Contract manufacturing revenue is
recorded at the time title to the wafer and risk of loss passes
to the customer, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria
have been satisfied. Shipping costs billed to our customers are
included within revenue. Associated costs are classified in cost
of goods sold. Approximately 63% of the companys revenues
are sold through distributors. Distributor payments are not
contingent upon resale or any other matter other than the
passage of time. The company has agreements with some
distributors and customers for various programs, including
prompt payment discounts, pricing protection, scrap allowances
and stock rotation. In general, credits allowed under these
programs are capped based upon individual distributor
agreements. The company records charges associated with these
programs as a reduction of revenue based upon historical
activity. The companys policy is to use a three to six
month rolling 47 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued historical experience rate in order to estimate
the necessary allowance to be recorded. In addition, the
products sold by the company are subject to a limited product
quality warranty. The company accrues for the estimated cost of
incurred but unidentified quality issues based upon historical
activity and known quality issues if a loss is probable and can
be reasonably estimated. The standard limited warranty period is
one year. Quality returns are accounted for as a reduction of
revenue. In some cases, title and risk of loss do not pass
to the customer when the product is shipped from our facilities.
In these cases, the company recognizes revenue at the time when
title and risk of loss is transferred, assuming all other
revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. These cases
include several inventory locations where we manage the
inventory for our customers, some of which are at customer
facilities. In such cases, revenue is not recognized when
products are shipped to these locations; rather, revenue is
recognized when customers take the inventory from the location
for their use. Advertising Advertising expenditures are charged to expense
as incurred. Advertising expenses for the years ended
December28, 2003, December29, 2002 and
December30, 2001 were not material to the consolidated
financial statements. Research and Development Costs The companys research and development
expenditures are charged to expense as incurred. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable
Securities The company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. The company invests excess cash in marketable
securities consisting primarily of commercial paper, corporate
notes and bonds, and U.S. Government securities with maturities
of no greater than 36months. At December28, 2003 and
December29, 2002, substantially all of the companys
marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. In
accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, unrealized gains
and losses on these investments are included as a separate
component of stockholders equity, net of any related tax
effect. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged
by management to be other than temporary on these investments
are included in interest income and expense. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
as of December28, 2003 and December29, 2002 are as

Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of standard
cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out
basis, or market. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost
and is generally depreciated based upon the following estimated
useful lives: buildings and improvements, ten to thirty years,
and machinery and equipment, three to ten years. Depreciation is
principally provided under the straight-line method. Software is
depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from three to
ten years. Investments Investments in which the companys interest
is less than 20% and which are not classified as
available-for-sale securities are carried at the lower of cost
or net realizable value unless it is determined that the company
exercises significant influence over the investee company, in
which case the equity method of accounting is used. For those
investments in affiliates in which the companys voting
interest is between 20% and 50%, the equity method of accounting
is generally used. Under this method, the investment balance,
originally recorded at cost, is adjusted to recognize the
companys share of net earnings or losses of the affiliates
as they occur, limited to the extent of the companys
investment in, advances to and commitments for the investee.
Currently, all of our strategic investments are less than 20%
owned. 49 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The company has certain strategic investments
that are accounted for on a cost basis as they are less than 20%
owned, and the company has no significant influence. During the
fourth quarter of 2000, and throughout 2001 and 2002, the
company had one investment, which was accounted for on the
equity method because the companys obligation to provide
capital was disproportionate to its equity ownership. Due to the
strategic nature of the investment, the company classified the
interest and net losses as research and development expense as
incurred. The amount charged to research and development was
$24million and $26million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. As of December29, 2002, the carrying value
of this investment was zero and the company had no further
commitment to provide support to the investee. The company assesses the need to record
impairment losses on investments and record such losses when the
impairment of an investment is determined to be other than
temporary in nature. These impairment losses are reflected in
other expense in the companys results of operations.
During 2001, the company recorded a $40million charge to
other expense for the write-off of an equity investment. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid
for acquisitions exceeds the fair value of net tangible and
intangible assets acquired. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No141 Business Combinations and SFAS No142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations completed after June30, 2001. SFAS
No142 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but rather
be tested annually for impairment. In accordance with SFAS
No141, goodwill recorded in conjunction with the
companys acquisition of Impala Linear Corporation in
September 2001 was not amortized See Note16. In
accordance with SFAS No142, the company ceased amortizing
goodwill beginning with the year ended December29, 2002. Prior to adopting SFAS No142, goodwill and
other acquisition-related intangibles were amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated lives, which was
generally three to fifteen years. Other Assets Other assets include deferred financing costs,
which represent costs incurred related to the issuance of the
companys long-term debt. The costs are being amortized
using the effective interest method over the related term of the
borrowings, which ranges from five to ten years, and are
included in interest expense. Also included in other assets are
mold and tooling costs. Molds and tools are amortized over their
expected useful lives, generally one to three years. Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived
Assets Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives are tested annually for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 142. The companys impairment review is
based on a discounted cash flow approach at the segment
reporting level that requires significant management judgment
with respect to revenue and expense growth rates, changes in
working capital and the selection and use of an appropriate
discount rate. The company uses its judgment in assessing
whether assets may have become impaired between annual
impairment tests. Indicators such as unexpected adverse business
conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological change
or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by
governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become
impaired. Intangible assets with estimable lives and other
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS144. Recoverability of intangible assets with
estimable lives and other long-lived assets is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to
future net 50 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset or asset group. If these comparisons
indicate that an asset is not recoverable, the impairment loss
recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value.
Estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax
operating cash flows or appraised values, depending on the
nature of the asset. The company determines the discount rate
for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return
for the related business and does not allocate interest charges
to the asset or asset group being measured. Considerable
judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating
cash flows. Currencies The companys functional currency for all
operations worldwide is the U.S.dollar. Accordingly, gains
and losses from translation of foreign currency financial
statements are included in current results. In addition, cash
conversion of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions
are included in current results. Unrealized and realized foreign
currency gains losses related to the translation and cash
conversion of foreign currencies were $32million 26million, and $20million for the years ended
December28, 2003, December29, 2002, and
December30, 2001, respectively. Foreign Currency Hedging The company utilizes various derivative financial
instruments to manage market risks associated with the
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. It is the
companys policy to use derivative financial instruments to
protect against market risk arising from the normal course of
business. The criteria the company uses for designating an
instrument as a hedge include the instruments
effectiveness in risk reduction and one-to-one matching of
derivative instruments to underlying transactions See
Note17. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of investments and trade accounts receivable. The company
maintains cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with
high credit quality financial institutions based upon the
companys analysis of that financial institutions
relative credit standing. The company sells its products to
distributors and original equipment manufacturers involved in a
variety of industries including computing, consumer,
communications, automotive and industrial. The company has
adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate industry
growth and inherent risk. The company performs continuing credit
evaluations of its customers financial condition and
requires collateral as deemed necessary. Reserves are provided
for estimated amounts of accounts receivable that may not be
collected. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and payable, and accrued liabilities
approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these
assets and liabilities. Fair values of long term debt, interest
rate swaps and caps, currency forward contracts and currency
options are based on quoted market prices or pricing models
using prevailing financial market information at the date of
measurement See Note14. Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial
Statements The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. 51 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Computation of Net Loss Per Share We calculate earnings per share in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share.
Basic net earnings per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The dilutive effect of the common stock equivalents is included
in the calculation of diluted earnings per share only when the
effect of their inclusion would be dilutive. Potentially
dilutive common equivalent shares consist of stock options,
deferred stock units DSUs and shares obtainable upon the
conversion of the convertible senior subordinated notes. Options to purchase 119million,
105million, and 45million shares of common stock
were outstanding at December28, 2003, December29,
2002 and December30, 2001, respectively, as well as
06million shares of deferred stock units DSUs
outstanding at December28, 2003, but were not included in
the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect
of including such options would have been anti-dilutive. In
addition, at December28, 2003, December29, 2002, and
December30, 2001, $68million, $69million and
$12million were not included in the computation of net
loss and 67million, 67million and
11million respectively, of potential common shares were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as
a result of the assumed conversion of the convertible senior
subordinated notes, because the effect would have been
anti-dilutive. Stock-Based Compensation The company has stock option plans, which are
described more fully in Note7. The company accounts for
those plans under APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss
per common share if the company had applied the fair value based
method of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to record expense for stock option
compensation. The following table illustrates the effect on net
loss and earnings per share if the fair value based method is
applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Note4 Goodwill and
Intangible Assets On December31, 2001 the beginning of
fiscal year 2002, the company adopted SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No142
requires the company to evaluate its existing intangible assets
and goodwill that were acquired in prior purchase business
combinations, and to make any necessary reclassifications in
order to conform to the new criteria in SFAS No141 for
recognition apart from goodwill. Accordingly, the company is
required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all
identifiable intangible assets acquired in purchase business
combinations, and make any necessary amortization period
adjustments. In addition, to the extent an intangible asset is
then determined to have an indefinite useful life, the company
is required to test the intangible asset for impairment in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. Other
intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their
useful lives. Under the provisions of SFAS No142, the
company was required to perform transitional goodwill impairment
tests within the first six months of adopting the standard,
which for us was as of December30, 2001 the beginning of
fiscal year 2002. The company completed the transitional
goodwill impairment tests during the first quarter of 2002 and
concluded that goodwill was not impaired. In order to complete the two-step goodwill
impairment tests as required by SFAS No142, the company
identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value
of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities,
including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those
reporting units as of the date of adoption. In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No142, the company has designated
reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment.
The standard defines a reporting unit as the lowest level of an
entity that is a business and that can be distinguished,
physically and operationally and for internal reporting
purposes, from the other activities, operations, and assets of
the entity. Goodwill was assigned to reporting units of the
company that were expected to benefit from the synergies of the
acquisition. Based on the provisions of the standard, the
company has determined that it has three reporting units for
purposes of goodwill impairment testing: Domestic Analog,
Domestic Discrete and Optoelectronics. In the first of a two-step impairment test, the
company determined the fair value of these reporting units using
a discounted cash flow valuation model and compared it to the
reporting units carrying value. If the fair value of a
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired and no further testing
is required. If the fair value does not exceed the carrying
value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be
performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step of the goodwill impairment
test, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is
compared to the carrying value. The implied fair value of the
reporting unit goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit
had been acquired in a business combination. If the carrying
value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied value,
an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the
excess. The companys valuation methodology requires
management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical
experience and projections of future operating performance. If
these assumptions differ materially from future results, the
company may record impairment charges in the future.
Additionally, the companys policy is to perform its annual
impairment testing for all reporting units in the fourth quarter
of each fiscal year. The company performed its annual impairment
test during the fourth quarter and concluded goodwill was not
impaired. 54 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Refinancing of Senior Credit
Facility On June19, 2003, the company completed a
refinancing of its senior credit facility the Credit
Agreement. The new $480million senior credit
facility includes a $300million term loan and a
$180million 56 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued revolving line of credit the Revolving
Credit Facility and is due on June19, 2008. The
term loan carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 25%, which was
36875% at December28, 2003. Borrowings under the
agreement are secured by a pledge of common stock of Fairchild
Semiconductor Corporation, the companys principal
operating subsidiary and the common stock of that companys
significant subsidiaries. In connection with the June 2003
financing, the company recorded $41million in deferred
financing fees for the term loan, which are being amortized over
five years and $25million in deferred financing fees for
the revolving line of credit, which are being amortized over
four years. In connection with a technical amendment on
October28, 2003 the company recorded an additional
$02million in deferred financing fees for the term loan,
which is being amortized over five years, and an additional
$01million in deferred financing fees for the revolving
credit line, which is being amortized over four years. The company used the proceeds from the
$300million term loan to redeem the 103/8% senior
subordinated notes that were due in October 2007 at a price of
105188% of face value. The $180 million revolving line of
credit replaces the companys previous $300million
revolving line of credit. In connection with the refinancing of
the notes, the company incurred charges totaling
$234million, including $174million for the call
premium on the 103/8% senior subordinated notes and other
transaction fees and $60million for a non-cash write-off
of deferred financing fees associated with the redeemed notes
and the previous credit facility. The Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn during
the year and at December 28, 2003. Borrowings under the Credit
Agreement are secured by a pledge of common stock of the company
and its subsidiaries. At December28, 2003, Fairchild had
outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit
facility totaling $07million. These outstanding letters
of credit reduce the amount available under the Revolving Credit
Facility to $1793million. Fairchild pays a commitment fee
of 05% per annum of the unutilized commitments under the
Revolving Credit Facility. Convertible Senior Subordinated
Notes On October31, 2001, Fairchild issued
$200million aggregate principal amount of 50% Convertible
Senior Subordinated Notes due November1, 2008. Interest on
the notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each
year. The notes are guaranteed by the company and its domestic
subsidiaries. The notes are unsecured obligations and
convertible, at the option of the holder, into common stock of
the company at a conversion price of $3000 per share, subject
to certain adjustments. The notes and the guarantees rank pari
passu in right of payment with Fairchild Semiconductor
Corporations existing senior subordinated notes and the
guarantees thereof, and with any future senior subordinated
indebtedness. Senior Subordinated Notes On January31, 2001, Fairchild issued
$3500million of 101/2% Senior Subordinated Notes
due February1, 2009 the 101/2% Notes
at face value. Interest on the notes is paid semi-annually on
February 1 and August 1 of each year, and the first interest
payment was made on August1, 2001. The 101/2% Notes
are unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future
senior indebtedness of Fairchild. Fairchild may redeem the notes
on or after February 1, 2005 in whole or in part at redemption
prices ranging from 100% to approximately 105% of the principal
amount. On April7, 1999, Fairchild issued
$3000million of 103/8% Senior Subordinated Notes
the 103/8% Notes at face value. On
June19, 2003, the company exercised the call provision to
redeem the $3000million of the 103/8% notes, at a
price of 105188% of face value. In connection with the
redemption, the company incurred charges totaling
$234million, including $174million for the call
premium and other transactions fees and $60million
non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees associated with
the redeemed notes and previous credit facility. 57 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued On March11, 1997, Fairchild issued
$3000million of 101/8% Senior Subordinated Notes
the 101/8% Notes and, together with the
103/8% Notes and the 101/2% Notes, the
Notes at face value. During December 2000, the
company repurchased 101/8% Notes with a face value of
$150million. On June 28, 2002, the company exercised the
call provision to redeem the remaining $2850million of
the 101/8% notes, at a price of 105063% of face value. In
connection with the redemption, the company incurred charges
totaling $221 million, including $145million for the
call premium and other transactions fees and $76million
non-cash write-off of deferred financing fees associated with
the original bond offering. The payment of principal and interest on the
Credit Agreement and the Notes is fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by Fairchild International. Fairchild International
is the parent company of Fairchild and currently conducts no
business and has no significant assets other than the capital
stock of Fairchild. Fairchild has seventeen direct subsidiaries
and six indirect subsidiaries, of which four direct
subsidiaries, Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation of California
Fairchild California, KOTA Microcircuits, Inc., QT
Optoelectronics, Inc., and QT Optoelectronics are guarantors on
the Credit Agreement and the Notes. The guarantees of the
guarantor subsidiaries as well as Fairchild International, are
joint and several. The remaining direct and indirect
subsidiaries are foreign-based and do not guarantee either the
Credit Agreement or the Notes. The companys senior credit facility and the
indentures under which the Notes were issued contain various
restrictions and covenants. The restrictive covenants include
limitations on consolidations, mergers and acquisitions,
restrictions on creating liens, restrictions on paying dividends
or making other similar restricted payments, restrictions on
asset sales, restrictions on capital expenditures and
limitations on incurring indebtedness, among other restrictions,
with which the company was in compliance at December28,
2003. The senior credit facility contains covenants relating to
financial ratios including a minimum interest coverage ratio and
a maximum senior leverage ratio, which the company was in
compliance with at December28, 2003. The senior credit
facility also limits the companys ability to modify its
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, shareholder agreements,
voting trusts or similar arrangements. In addition, the senior
credit facility and the indentures governing all senior
subordinated notes, contain additional restrictions limiting the
ability of the companys subsidiaries to pay dividends or
make advances to the company. Aggregate maturities of long-term
debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as

device business in 1999, the Korean government granted a ten
year tax holiday to Fairchild Korea Semiconductor Ltd. The
original exemption was 100% for the first seven years of the
holiday and 50% for the remaining three years of the holiday. In
2000, the tax holiday was extended such that the exemption
amounts were increased to 75% in the eighth year and a 25%
exemption was added to the eleventh year. Taxes exempted include
income taxes, dividend withholding taxes, acquisition tax,
registration tax, property tax and aggregate land tax. As such,
no current provision for income taxes for 58 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
classified in the consolidated balance sheet based on the
classification of the related asset or liability. The deferred
tax valuation allowance remained the same and decreased by $25
million for the years ended December28, 2003 and
December29, 2002, respectively. In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, the company considered its
levels of historical, current, and future taxable earnings and
the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences. We
make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax
assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is
based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will
generate sufficient future taxable income in certain
jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. This
likelihood is supported by tax planning strategies available to
the company that are both prudent and feasible. These strategies
would be implemented to preserve the deferred tax asset. A
valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets
which we do not believe meet the more likely than
not criteria established by SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Our judgments regarding
future taxable income may be revised due to changes in market
conditions, tax laws, or other factors. If our assumptions and
estimates change in the future, then the valuation allowances we
have established may be increased, resulting in increased income
tax expense. Conversely, if we are ultimately able to utilize
all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a
valuation allowance has been established, then the related
portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as
a credit to income tax expense. In addition, the calculation of our tax
liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the
application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of
jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for
anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax
jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the
extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of
these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal
of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized
in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer
necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would
result. Based on projections of taxable income over the
next several years, and considering the limitations imposed by
section 382, we believe that none of the loss carry forwards
will expire unused. Consequently, we believe it is more likely
than not that the company will realize the benefits of the
deductible temporary differences. In order to fully realize the
deferred tax assets, the company will need to generate
$377million of aggregate future U.S.taxable income
prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which occur
in the years 2018 through 2023. Net operating loss and research and development
credit carryforwards totaled $3371million and
$12million, respectively, as of December28, 2003.
The net operating losses expire in 2018 through 2023. The
research and development credits expire in varying amounts in
2012 through 2023. During 2002, the company applied for
alternative minimum tax credit refunds totaling
$22million, of which $2million were received in
2002 and the balance in 2003. In addition, the company has
Malaysian unabsorbed capital allowances of 61 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued approximately $47million, which can be
used to offset future years taxable income of that
Malaysian subsidiary. The companys ability to utilize its net
operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the
future if the company experiences an ownership change, as
defined by the Internal Revenue Code. An ownership change occurs
when the ownership percentage of 5% or greater stockholders
changes by more than 50% over a three year period. In August
1999, the company experienced an ownership change as a result of
its initial public offering; such ownership change did not
result in a material limitation on the utilization of the loss
and credit carryforwards. As of December28, 2003, the
company has not undergone a second ownership change. Deferred income taxes have not been provided for
the undistributed earnings of the companys foreign
subsidiaries, which aggregated approximately $3005million
at December28, 2003. The company plans to reinvest all
such earnings for future expansion. The undistributed earnings
will be subject to U.S.taxation upon repatriation as
dividends to the U.S. parent. The amount of taxes attributable
to these undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable. Note7 Stock Based
Compensation The company has two equity compensation plans.
Under the Fairchild Semiconductor Stock Plan Stock Plan,
executives, key employees, non-employee directors and certain
consultants may be granted stock options, restricted shares,
deferred stock units, stock-appreciation rights and other
stock-based awards. The company also has a stock option plan
the 2000 Executive Stock Option Plan, under which key
executives, including officers, may be granted stock options. A total of 27,373,283shares have been
authorized for issuance under awards under the Stock Plan. At
December28, 2003, 20,555,534stock options were
outstanding and 2,575,637 were available to be granted under
that plan. Options granted under the plan may be either
aoptions intended to constitute incentive stock options
ISOs under the Internal Revenue Code or
bnon-qualified stock options. The Stock Plan also authorizes up to
500,000shares for issuance under awards of restricted
shares, deferred stock units and other non-option based awards.
The first grant of DSUs occurred in April, 2003. At
December28, 2003, 249,177DSUs were outstanding
and 247,913 were available to be granted under the plan. In
2003, the company also granted 325,000deferred stock units
to KirkP. Pond, chairman, president and CEO, outside of
this plan, all of which remain outstanding. The exercise price of options granted under the
Stock Plan is generally equal to the fair market value of our
common stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of any
option is ten years from the date of grant for incentive stock
options and ten years and one day from the date of grant for
non-qualified stock options. Options granted under the plan are
exercisable at the determination of the compensation committee,
generally vesting ratably over approximately four years. The 2000 Executive Stock Option Plan authorizes
up to 1,671,669shares of common stock to be issued upon
exercise of options under that plan. At December28, 2003,
1,514,525 of such options were outstanding and
157,144shares were available to be granted. Options
granted under the plan are intended to be non-qualified stock
options. The terms of each option granted under the 2000
Executive Plan, including the number of shares that are subject
to the option, the exercise price and term, and its
exercisability, are determined by the compensation committee.
The exercise price may be greater or less than the fair market
value of a share of the companys common stock on the date
of grant or it may vary in accordance with a predetermined
formula while the option is outstanding. Individuals receiving
options under the Plan may not receive in any one year options
to purchase more than 1,500,000 shares of common stock. If the
company engages in a merger or other reorganization, outstanding
option grants will be subject to the agreement of merger or
reorganization, which may provide for the assumption of
outstanding awards by the surviving 62 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued corporation or its parent, for their continuation
by the company if the company is a surviving corporation, for
accelerated vesting or for their cancellation with or without
consideration, in all cases without the consent of the
participant. Also, the committee may determine, at the time of
granting an option or thereafter, that the option will become
fully exercisable as to all shares subject to the option in the
event of a change in control as defined in the plan. During 2001, the company implemented a voluntary
stock option exchange program for the 2000 Executive Stock
Option Plan. Under the program, executives could elect to have
their outstanding options cancelled on August13, 2001. New
stock options were issued to replace cancelled options on
February22, 2002 at the then fair market value of
$2380per share. The number of replacement options that
were issued was equal to 55% of the options surrendered. A summary of the status of the companys
stock option plans as of December28, 2003,
December29, 2002, and December30, 2001, and changes

The company maintains the Fairchild Semiconductor
International, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which started
on April1, 2000. The stock purchase plan authorizes the
issuance of up to 4,000,000shares of common stock in
quarterly offerings to eligible employees at a price that is
equal to 85percent of the lower of the common stocks
fair value at the beginning or the end of a quarterly period.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The company accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB
No25. As such, compensation expense is recorded on the
date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying
stock exceeds the exercise price. Note8 Retirement
Plans The company sponsors the Fairchild Personal
Savings and Retirement Plan the Retirement Plan, a
contributory savings plan which qualifies under
section401k of the Internal Revenue Code. The Retirement
Plan covers substantially all employees in the United States.
The company provides a matching contribution equal to 50% of
employee elective deferrals up to a maximum of 6% of an
employees annual compensation. The company also maintains
a non-qualified Benefit Restoration Plan, under which employees
who have otherwise exceeded annual IRS limitations for elective
deferrals can continue to contribute to their retirement
savings. The company matches employee elective deferrals to the
Benefit Restoration Plan on the same basis as the Retirement
Plan. Beginning in 2001, throughout 2002 and for a portion of
2003, the 401k match was suspended for substantially all
employees. Total expense recognized under these plans was
$28million, $07million, and $40million, for
the years ended December28, 2003, December29, 2002,
and December30, 2001, respectively. Employees in Korea who have been with the company
for over one year are entitled by Korean law to receive lump-sum
payments upon termination of their employment. The payments are
based on current rates of pay and length of service through the
date of termination. It is the companys policy to accrue
for this estimated liability as of each balance sheet date,
which was $124million and $119million as of
December28, 2003 and December29, 2002, respectively
and was included within Other Long Term Liabilities. Amounts
recognized as expense were $71million, $64million,
and $56million, for the years ended December28,
2003, December29, 2002, and December30, 2001,
respectively. Employees in Malaysia participate in a defined
contribution plan. The company has funded accruals for this plan
in accordance with statutory regulations in Malaysia.
Contributions made by the company under this plan were
$18million, $18million, and $19million, for
the years ended December28, 2003, December29, 2002,
and December30, 2001, respectively. Employees in the Philippines participate in a
defined benefit plan. The benefits are based on years of service
and a multiple of the employees final monthly salary. The
companys funding policy is to contribute annually the
amount necessary to maintain the plan on an actuarially sound
basis. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed to service to date but also for those
expected to be earned in the future. The contributions made for
the years ended December28, 2003, December29, 2002
and December30, 2001, respectively were not material to
the consolidated financial statements. Employees in England, Italy, Germany, Hong Kong,
China, Singapore and Japan are also covered by a variety of
defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans that are
administered consistent with local statutes and practices. The
contributions made under each of the respective plans for 2003,
2002, and 2001 were not material to the consolidated financial
statements. The aggregate liability established for our
foreign defined benefit plans was $16million and
$11million at December28, 2003 and
December29, 2002, respectively. Certain executives of the company are eligible
for post-retirement health benefits, which are being accrued
ratably over the three year term of the related employment
agreements entered into by the executives with the company in
2000. At December28, 2003, the accrual for post-retirement
health benefits is not material to the consolidated financial
statements. 64 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges. First Quarter 2001 Restructuring
Program During the first quarter of 2001 the company
recorded a $95million restructuring charge. The charge
included $12million to cover employee separation costs
relating to the termination of approximately 300salaried,
hourly and temporary employees, primarily in the Philippines and
$83million of asset impairments and other exit costs
associated with the decommissioning of these assets. The
affected employees were notified in the first quarter of 2001
and terminations and cash payments were completed in the second
quarter. The asset impairment charge related to the closure of
the companys 5wafer fabrication line in South
Portland, Maine and was determined based upon the difference
between the carrying value of the assets and available market
quotations of similar equipment. The closure was completed at
the beginning of the third quarter. Second Quarter 2001 Restructuring
Program In the second quarter of 2001, the company
recorded restructuring charges totaling $39million. These
charges were for employee separation costs relating to the
termination of approximately 400 employees. Payments under the
headcount reduction actions began in the second quarter of 2001
and were completed by December30, 2001. These actions
impacted employees in both the United States and Malaysia. Third Quarter 2001 Restructuring
Program During the third quarter of 2001 the company
recorded restructuring charges totaling $08million. These
charges were for employee separation costs relating to the
termination of approximately 50 employees in the United States

charges were for employee separation costs for approximately 250
employees, primarily in Malaysia and the United States. The
charge included a $21million non-cash charge for the
costs associated with the separation of certain executives.
These non-cash charges were for the forgiveness of loans and
charges in connection with a modification of option grants.
Payments under the headcount reduction actions began in the
fourth quarter of 2001 and were substantially complete by
June30, 2002. There remains an accrual of
$01million related to a disputed severance payment which
the company expects to have resolved by the end of the first
quarter of 2004. 66 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued First Quarter 2002 Restructuring
Program During the first quarter of 2002, the company
recorded restructuring charges totaling $36million. These
charges were for employee separation costs for approximately
150employees in the United States, Europe, Japan and
Malaysia. Payments under the headcount reduction action began in
the first quarter of 2002 and were completed by
December29, 2002. Fourth Quarter 2002 Restructuring
Program During the fourth quarter of 2002 the company
recorded charges totaling $86million. The charges include
$70million for employee separation costs for
approximately 145employees in the United States, Europe,
Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia and $16 non-cash impairment
charges relating to the closure of our Carlsbad, California
office. Payments under the headcount reduction action began in
the fourth quarter of 2002 and were completed by
September30, 2003. In October of 2002, the company decided to
discontinue offering certain mixed signal and video products. In
connection with this decision, the company announced the closure
of the Carlsbad, California office which supported these
particular products. The $16million charge included
$10million for a lease buyout charge, $04million
for other contract termination charges and a $02million
charge for assets which were abandoned. The location was closed
during December 2002 in accordance with our plan. In connection
with this action, the company also recorded an inventory charge
of $16million in cost of goods sold to reflect the
write-down of inventory which discontinued. First Quarter 2003 Restructuring
Program During the first quarter of 2003, the company
recorded a charge of $104million. The charge included
$57million to cover employee separation costs relating to
the termination of approximately 190 employees
$10million for first quarter actions and
$47million related to the closure of our
6Mountaintop,PA facility, $27million
of asset impairments $22million related to our
6Mountaintop,PA closure and $05million
in other locations, $15million for exit costs associated
with the decommissioning of certain assets and $05million
in expected lease termination and other exit costs. The
headcount actions began in the first quarter of 2003 and are
expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2004 and will
impact manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel, primarily
in the United States. Approximately 20employees were
terminated during 2003. The asset impairments, decommissioning costs,
lease termination costs and other exit costs relate primarily to
the closure of the 6wafer fab in
Mountaintop,PA. Asset impairment charges were based upon
available market quotations for similar equipment. As part of
the decision to close the 6wafer fab in
Mountaintop,PA, the company intends to discontinue
manufacturing certain products and transfer the remaining
products to either the 8wafer fab line in
Mountaintop,PA or to Bucheon, South Korea. This closure is
expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2004. In addition, the company recorded a charge of
$22million of additional distributor reserves as a
reduction of revenues as a result of the discontinuation of
certain products in connection with the 6fab closure. Second Quarter 2003 Restructuring
Program During the second quarter of 2003, the company
recorded restructuring charges totaling $497million. In response to the continued weakness in the
semiconductor industry, the company decided upon a restructuring
plan to consolidate manufacturing lines, exit certain
businesses, reduce headcount as well outsource non-strategic
product offerings. In addition, the company, as it has
throughout the economic 67 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued downturn, completed a recoverability analysis of
certain facilities to determine whether any asset impairment
existed. As a result of these decisions and analysis, the
company has recorded charges in connection with its plan to
close the 4wafer fabrication facility in South
Portland, Maine and transfer the manufacturing of certain of
these products to the 6 line in South Portland, Maine.
These charges included $30million in employee separation
costs, $20million in asset impairments and
$09million of other exit costs, primarily related to
decommissioning. The company also recorded a charge in
connection with the anticipated plant closures in Wuxi, China
and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. For the products currently
manufactured in both Wuxi, China and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the
company has entered into an agreement to sell the manufacturing
assets of the facility to a third party and, in turn, engage the
third party to perform subcontracting services for the company.
These charges include $52million in employee separation
costs and $46million in asset impairment costs. The
company expects that the South Portland, Maine closure will be
completed in the second quarter of 2004, the Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia closure in the third quarter of 2004 and the Wuxi,
China closure by the end of 2004. It was determined that there were certain wafer
fabrication assets located in Bucheon, South Korea for which the
carrying amount exceeded the expected undiscounted cash flow
from their use. Accordingly, a charge of $214million was
recorded in order to reflect these long-lived assets at their
fair value which was determined based upon a discounted cash
flow analysis. During the second quarter of 2003, the company
also incurred additional employee separation costs of
$108million for various other headcount reduction
actions, primarily in the United States and Korea. Payments
under the headcount reduction action began in the second quarter
of 2003 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2004. The company also recorded additional severance
for stay-on bonuses of $11million and $07million
for technology transfer and other costs during the second
quarter of 2003 associated with the ongoing costs of the First
Quarter 2003 Restructuring Program. The company recorded a charge of
$10million and $29million of distributor and
inventory reserves, recorded in revenues and cost of sales,
respectively, associated with the exit from the sale of hybrid
and non-volatile memory products as well as product
discontinuation in connection with our 6 wafer fab closure. Third Quarter 2003 Restructuring
Program During the third quarter of 2003, the company
recorded restructuring charges totaling $26million. The
charge included $16million of employee separation costs
relating to severance and other costs associated with
approximately 25salaried and hourly employees in the
United States and Europe. The company recorded additional costs
of $09million, primarily related to the transfer of
technologies during the third quarter of 2003 associated with
the ongoing costs of the First Quarter 2003 Restructuring
Program. The company also recorded additional costs of
$01million during the third quarter of 2003 associated
with the ongoing costs of the Second Quarter 2003 Restructuring
Program. In addition, the company recorded a pre-tax charge of
$23million and $11million of distributor and
inventory reserves, recorded in revenues and cost of sales,
respectively, associated with the decision to discontinue
certain products manufactured in the 4wafer fab in
South Portland, Maine. Fourth Quarter 2003 Restructuring
Program During the fourth quarter of 2003, the company
recorded restructuring charges totaling $39million. The
charge included $29million of employee separation costs,
primarily relating to severance and other costs associated with
approximately 50 salaried and hourly employees in Korea. In
addition, $08million was recorded in order to reduce
the accrual for employee separation costs relating to the
6Mountaintop,PA 68 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Transactions Court Square Capital Limited, an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., and its affiliate together
owned approximately 151% of Fairchild Semiconductors
outstanding capital stock as of December29, 2002. To the
companys knowledge, based on SEC filings received by the
company, Citicorp and affiliates had disposed of all their
Fairchild Semiconductor shares by September5, 2003.
Citigroup Venture Capital Equity Partners, also an indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., indirectly owns an
interest in ChipPAC, Inc. Paul C. SchorrIV, who is
employed by Citigroup Venture Capital Equity Partners, is a
member of the Fairchild Semiconductor board of directors and the
ChipPAC board of directors. Fairchild 70 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Semiconductor subcontracts a portion of its
assembly and test manufacturing operations to ChipPAC. Fairchild
paid ChipPAC a total of approximately $34 million 39million and $25 million for such services in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. In May and June, 2002, we completed a follow-on
public stock offering in which the company sold
16,219,196shares of newly issued common stock including
shares sold following the exercise of the underwriters
over-allotment option and Court Square Capital Limited sold
6,000,000 existing shares. Salomon Smith Barney, an affiliate of
Citigroup Inc., was co-lead managing underwriter for that
offering. On July23, 2002, the company and John M.
Watkins, Jr., Senior Vice President and Chief Information
Officer, agreed to extend and modify the terms of existing loans
that were made to Mr.Watkins in connection with his
employment by the company in 2000. The original loans bore
interest at a rate of 65% per year and were to have been repaid
in April 2002 or earlier if Mr.Watkins employment
were to have terminated for any reason. Under the modified
terms, one of the loans, made to fund federal and state income
tax withholding obligations resulting from a grant of restricted
stock to Mr.Watkins when he joined the company, will be
forgiven with accrued interest to the date of forgiveness, and
the company will pay taxes associated with such forgiveness, if
Mr.Watkins remains employed by the company on
July23, 2004. During 2003, the company recorded a charge
of $04million to reflect the forgiveness of the loan and
accrued interest. The other loan, not related to the tax
obligations, must be repaid by Mr.Watkins on or before
July23, 2004. Including accrued interest to the date of
the modifications, the principal amount of the tax-related loan
was $05million and the principal amount of the other loan
was $02million. The modified loans bear interest at a
rate of 475% per year. Note13
Contingencies The company adopted the provisions of FASB
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. The Interpretation
requires that the company recognize the fair value of guarantee
and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by the
company after December31, 2002, if these arrangements are
within the scope of that Interpretation. In addition, under
previously existing generally accepted accounting principles,
the company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject
to the guarantees and indemnifications to identify whether it is
probable that a loss has occurred and would recognize any such
losses under the guarantees and indemnifications when those
losses are estimable. In support of a bank line of credit made by a
strategic equity investee, the company has issued a
$29million standby letter of credit, with terms through
March 2004. The company would be required to perform in the
event of a default on the bank line of credit of the equity
investee. As recourse, the company has received a promise to
grant a security interest in the proceeds of certain
intellectual property. As of December28, 2003, no amounts
have been accrued for any estimated losses under the obligation,
as it is probable that the equity investee will make all
scheduled payments under the bank line of credit. We also
estimate that the proceeds from liquidation of the collateral
would be expected to cover the amount of potential future
payments under the guarantee. The company has issued a $20million
guarantee of the existing indebtedness of a strategic technical
partner, with terms through January 2004. The guarantee arose in
consideration for fully paid-up and royalty free licenses
covering usage of certain intellectual property. The company
would be required to perform in the event of a default by the
licensor. As recourse, the company has received a security
interest in certain intellectual and other property. As of
December28, 2003, no amounts have been accrued for any
estimated losses under the obligation, as it is probable that
the strategic partner will make all scheduled payments under the
existing indebtedness. We also estimate that the proceeds from
liquidation of the collateral would be expected to cover the
amount of potential future payments under the guarantee. 71 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The companys facilities in South Portland,
Maine and West Jordan, Utah have ongoing remediation projects to
respond to certain releases of hazardous substances that
occurred prior to the Recapitalization. Pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement with National Semiconductor, National
Semiconductor has agreed to indemnify the company for the future
costs of these projects. The terms of the indemnification are
without time limit and without maximum amount. The costs
incurred to respond to these conditions were not material to the
consolidated financial statements for any period presented. The
current carrying value of the liability at December28,
2003 was $04million. The companys former Mountain View,
California, facility is located on a contaminated site under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement with Raytheon
Company, Raytheon Company has assumed responsibility for all
remediation costs or other liabilities related to historical
contamination. The purchaser of the Mountain View, California
property received an environmental indemnity from us similar in
scope to the one we received from Raytheon. The purchaser can
hold us liable under our indemnity for any claims, liabilities
or damages it incurs as a result of the historical
contamination, including any remediation costs or other
liabilities related to the contamination. We are unable to
estimate the potential amounts of future payments; however, we
do not expect any future payments to have a material impact on
our earnings or financial condition. Pursuant to the 1999 asset agreement to purchase
the power device business of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.,
Samsung agreed to indemnify the company for remediation costs
and other liabilities related to historical contamination, up to
$150million. We are unable to estimate the potential
amounts of future payments, if any; however, we do not expect
any future payments to have a material impact on our earnings or
financial condition. The companys facility in Mountaintop,
Pennsylvania has an ongoing remediation project to respond to
releases of hazardous materials that occurred prior to
acquisition of the discrete power products DPPbusiness
from Intersil Corporation. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement
with Intersil, Intersil indemnified the company for specific
environmental issues. The terms of the indemnification are
without time limit and without maximum amount. From time to time since late 2001, the company
has received claims from a number of customers seeking damages
resulting from certain products manufactured with a
phosphorus-containing mold compound. Mold compound is the
plastic resin used to encapsulate semiconductor chips. This
particular mold compound causes some chips to short in some
situations, resulting in chip failure. In August 2002 the
company filed a lawsuit against the mold compound supplier,
Sumitomo Bakelite Singapore Pte. Ltd. and other related parties,
seeking unspecified damages, including damages caused to our
customers. Other manufacturers have also filed lawsuits against
the supplier in connection with the mold compound issue. The
companys lawsuit is pending in California Superior Court
for Santa Clara County. The company is unable to predict the
outcome of this litigation and there can be no assurances that
the company will prevail, nor can the company predict the amount
of damages the company may recover if the company does prevail.
Although the company has not been sued by any of our customers
as a result of this matter, several of our customers have
threatened to begin litigation if their claims are not resolved
according to their demands, and the company may face lawsuits as
a result. The company has limited insurance coverage for such
customer claims. Based on the companys assessment of the
claims to date, taking into account factors which the company
believes are relevant, the company believes it to be reasonably
possible that current claims may be in excess of the
companys insurance limits. At this time the company is
unable to reasonably estimate any range of possible loss which
may be incurred as a result of any customer claims or payments
the company may make in excess of insurance coverage, and
accordingly the company has made no provisions for such claims
in our consolidated statements of operations. If the company
continues to receive additional claims for damages from
customers beyond the period of time normally observed for such
claims, or if these claims proceed to litigation, or if the
company 72 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued chooses to settle claims in settlement of or to
avoid litigation, then the amount necessary to resolve such
claims may or may not adversely affect the companys
financial results or financial position. In addition, in the normal course of business,
the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other
claims, including proceedings under laws and regulations related
to environmental and other matters. All such matters are subject
to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with
assurance. Consequently, the company is unable to ascertain the
ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial
impact with respect to these additional matters at
December28, 2003. It is managements opinion that
after final disposition, any monetary liability or financial
impact to the company would not be material to the
companys financial position, annual results of operations
or cash flows. Note14 Financial
Instruments Fair Value and Notional Principal of
Derivative Financial Instruments The table below shows the fair value and notional
principal of the companys derivative financial instruments
as of December28, 2003 and December29, 2002. The
notional principal amounts for these instruments provide one
measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year end and
do not represent the amount of the companys exposure to
credit or market loss. The estimates of fair value are based on
applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing
financial market information as of December28, 2003 and
December29, 2002. Although the following table reflects
the notional principal and fair value of amounts of derivative
financial instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses
associated with the exposures and transactions that these
financial instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts
ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial
instruments, together with the gains and losses on the
underlying exposures will depend on actual market conditions
during the remaining life of the instruments.

Note15 Operating Segment and
Geographic Information Fairchild designs, develops, manufactures and
markets high performance multi-market semiconductors. The
company is currently organized into three reportable segments:
Analog and Mixed Signal Products Group, Discrete Products Group
and Logic and Memory Products Group. 73 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The company has determined that its
Optoelectronics Group does not meet the threshold for a separate
reportable segment under SFAS No131, and accordingly
these segments results are included as part of the
Other category for all periods presented. Management
evaluates the contract manufacturing business differently than
its other operating segments due in large part to the fact that
it is predominantly driven by contractual agreements for limited
time periods entered into with National Semiconductor and
Samsung Electronics. In addition to the operating segments mentioned
above, the company also operates global operations, sales and
marketing, information systems, finance and administration
groups that are led by vice presidents who report to the Chief
Executive Officer. The expenses of these groups are generally
allocated to the operating segments based upon their percentage
of total revenue and are included in the operating results
reported below. The company does not allocate income taxes to
its operating segments, and while interest expense allocations
are made for informational purposes, the operating segments are
principally evaluated on operating profit before interest and
taxes. The company does not specifically identify and
allocate all assets by operating segment. It is the
companys policy to fully allocate depreciation and
amortization to its operating segments. Operating segments do
not sell products to each other, and accordingly, there are no
inter-segment revenues to be reported. The accounting policies
for segment reporting are the same as for the company as a whole. Statement of operations information on reportable
segments for 2003, 2002, and 2001 is as follows

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Note16 Acquisitions and
Divestures On October20, 2003, the company completed
its acquisition of the commercial unit of RFComponents
Division of the Raytheon Company for approximately
$95million in cash. Fairchilds new
RFComponents product line is a developer and high volume
manufacturer of components for the wireless communications
industry. The purchase also included the acquisition of
Raytheons foundry partnership agreement for the supply of
gallium arsenide wafers and an equity stake in WIN Semiconductor
Corporation, as well as access to foundry and support services
at Raytheons Andover, Massachusetts facility. The
transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the acquired
product lines results of operations since the date of
acquisition have been included in the accompanying statement of
operations. In connection with the purchase, the company
recorded a non-recurring charge of $21million for
in-process research and development. The remaining purchase
price was allocated to various tangible and intangible assets,
which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of
7years. On March25, 2002, the company completed its
acquisition of the assets of Signal Processing Technologies,
Inc. SPT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toko, Inc., for
approximately $40million in cash. The acquired business,
located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, markets high performance
analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters and
comparators for the consumer, communications and industrial
markets. The purchase also includes a design center in Horten,
Norway. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the
acquired businesss results of operations since the date of
acquisition have been included in the accompanying statement of
operations. In connection with the SPT purchase, the company
recorded a non-recurring charge of $07million for
in-process research and development. The remaining purchase
price was allocated to various tangible and identifiable
intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated
useful lives of 5years. On March20, 2002, the company completed its
acquisition of the cross-point switch product line and
associated intellectual property of I-Cube, Inc. I-Cube for
approximately $10million in cash. Cross-point switch
products are critical to Internet infrastructure, data
communications, telecommunications, broadcast video, test
equipment and digital signal processing. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase and the acquired product lines
results of operation since the date of acquisition have been
included in the accompanying statement of operations. The
purchase price was allocated entirely to in-process research and
development. On March20, 2002, the Company sold its
military and space-related discrete power product line to
International Rectifier Corporation IRfor approximately
$296million in cash. This military and space-related
discrete product line was originally a component of the DPP
acquisition in 2001, which is currently included in our Discrete
Products Group segment. A decision was made to sell this space
and defense product line subsequent to our acquisition, as the
segment did not fit the strategic direction of the Company. The
net carrying value of the assets sold consisted primarily of
inventory $26million, developed technology
$52million, and customer contracts, net of certain
liabilities $07million not assumed by IR. As a result
of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of $211million,
which was net of the carrying value of the assets acquired by
IR, primarily consisting of inventory and intellectual property,
transaction fees and other costs associated with the sale. On September5, 2001, the company completed
its acquisition of Impala Linear Corporation Impala for
approximately $46million, subject to post-closing
adjustments, paid in the companys common stock. Impala
designs analog power management semiconductors for a wide range
of portable devices including laptops, MP3 players, cell phones,
portable test equipment and PDAs. The transaction was
accounted for as a purchase and the acquired businesss
results of operations since the date of acquisition have been
included in the accompanying statement of operations. The
purchase price has been allocated based on estimated fair values
at the date of acquisition. In connection with the Impala
acquisition, the company recorded a 76 Table of Contents FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR INTERNATIONAL, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 10million charge for in-process research
and development. The allocation resulted in acquired goodwill of
approximately $51million. On March16, 2001, the company completed its
acquisition of DPP for a purchase price of approximately
$3442million in cash, including related acquisition
expenses, subject to post-closing adjustments. DPP was a leading
provider of silicon-based discrete power devices for the
computer, communications, industrial, automotive, and space and
defense end-user markets. The transaction was accounted for as a
purchase and DPPs results of operations since the date of
acquisition have been included in the accompanying statement of
operations. The purchase price has been allocated based on
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. In connection
with the DPP acquisition, the company recorded a charge of
$128million for in-process research and development. The
allocation resulted in acquired goodwill of approximately
$1661million, with the remainder of the purchase price in
excess of the fair value of net tangible assets allocated to
various other intangible assets. All acquisitions completed for 2003, 2002 and
2001 are immaterial and, therefore, no pro forma results of
operations are presented. Note17 Derivatives Effective January1, 2001, the company
adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities, and SFAS No138
Accounting for Certain Derivatives and Hedging Activities
An Amendment of FASB Statement No133, which
modified certain provisions of SFAS No133. All
derivatives, whether designated as hedging relationships or not,
are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
The company utilizes fair value hedges, as defined by SFAS
No133 and SFAS No138, to hedge certain foreign
currency balance sheet exposures and cash flow hedges to hedge
certain foreign currency forecasted revenue streams. If the
derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in
the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If
the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective
portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded
in other comprehensive income OCIand are recognized in
the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.
Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow
hedges are recognized in earnings. The company monitors its foreign currency
exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of its foreign
currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include
the Euro and the Japanese yen. The companys objectives for
holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most
effective methods to reduce the impact of these exposures. Changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments related to time value are included in the assessment
of hedge effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness, determined in
accordance with SFAS No133 and SFAS No138, had no
impact on earnings for the years ended December28, 2003,
December29, 2002, and December 30, 2001. No cash flow
hedges were derecognized or discontinued in 2003, 2002 or 2001. The adoption of SFAS No133 and SFAS
No138 on January1, 2001, resulted in no cumulative
adjustment to income or OCI as no cash flow derivative
instruments were outstanding at December31, 2000. Note18 Condensed

PART II
Item 5.Controls
and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to assure, as much as is reasonably possible, that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is communicated to
management and recorded, processed, summarized and disclosed
within the specified time periods. Any control system, however,
no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the systems
objectives will be met. As of the end of the period covered by
this report, our CEO and CFO have evaluated, with the
participation of our management, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, our
CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent
fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. PART III
