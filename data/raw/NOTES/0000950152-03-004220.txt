of LanVision Systems, Inc. as of January31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in convertible redeemable preferred stock and stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended January31, 2003. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule of LanVision Systems, Inc. listed
in . These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of LanVision Systems, Inc. at
January31, 2003 and 2002 and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January31, 2003 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth herein. s/ Ernst Young LLP Cincinnati, Ohio March7, 2003 29 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

STATEMENTS 1.Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies LanVision Systems, Inc. the Company operates in
one segment as a provider of Healthcare Information Access
Systems through the licensing of its Electronic Medical Record
Workflow software applications and the use of such applications
through its application-hosting services as an Application
Service Provider. LanVisions products enable hospitals and
integrated healthcare delivery systems in the United States to
capture, store, manage, route, retrieve, and process vast
amounts of patient clinical and financial information. Fiscal Year All references to a fiscal year refer to the
fiscal year commencing February1 in that calendar year and
ending on January31 of the following year. Beginning in
fiscal year 2002, certain expenses that were previously
classified as cost of services, maintenance and support and
selling, general and administrative expenses have been
reclassified to product research and development because the
work performed by the individuals involved have, over time,
evolved into more product development related activities. Prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2002
financial statement presentation. Approximately $197,000 and
$374,000, of fiscal year 2001 and 2000, respectively, of the
cost of services maintenance and support and approximately 576,000 and $654,000, of fiscal year 2001 and 2000,
respectively, of selling, general and administrative expenses
have been reclassified to research and development expense in
fiscal years 2001 and 2000. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of LanVision Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary,
LanVision, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions are
eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is derived from: the licensing and sale
of systems, either directly to end-users or through third-party
resellers, comprising internally developed software, third-party
software and hardware components; product support, maintenance
and professional services; and application-hosting services that
provide high quality, transaction or subscription based document
imaging/management services from a central data center.
LanVisions revenue recognition policies conform to
Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition.
Generally, revenue from software license fees and hardware sales
to end-users is recognized when a master agreement is signed and
products are made available to end-users. Revenues from
agreements that contain multiple-element arrangements are
allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the
elements. Revenues related to routine installation and
integration and project management are deferred until the work
is performed. If a contract requires LanVision to perform
services and modifications that are deemed significant to system
acceptance, revenues are recorded either on the
percentage-of-completion method or revenues related to the
delivered hardware and software components are deferred until
such obligations are deemed insignificant, depending on the
contractual terms. LanVision follows this method since
reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs
applicable to various stages of a contract can be made.
Recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the
contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates
are charged or credited to income in the period in which the
facts that give rise to the revision become known. Revenues from
consulting, education, and application-hosting services are
recognized as the services are performed. Revenues from
short-term support and maintenance agreements are recognized 34 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued ratably over the term of the agreements. Billings
to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are
classified as deferred revenues. Revenues recognized prior to
progress billings to customers are recorded as contract
receivables. Under the terms of a Remarketing Agreement with
Siemens Medical Solutions Health Services Corporation, Siemens
remits royalties to LanVision based upon Siemens sublicensing
LanVisions software to Siemenss customers.
Twenty-five percent of the royalty is due 30days following
the end of the quarter in which Siemens executes the end-user
license agreement with its customer. LanVision recognizes this
revenue upon receipt of the royalty report. The remaining
seventy-five percent of the royalty is due from Siemens when
software implementation activities commence. LanVision records
this revenue when the seventy-five percent payment due from
Siemens is fixed and determinable, which is generally when
software implementation activities commence. Under the terms of a Remarketing Agreement with
IDX Information Systems Corporation royalties are remitted by
IDX to LanVision based upon IDX sublicensing LanVisions
software to IDXs customers. Thirty percent of the royalty
is due 45days following the end of the month in which IDX
executes an end-user license agreement with its customer.
LanVision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty
report. The remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from
IDX, in varying amounts based on implementation milestones,
45days following the end of the month in which a milestone
occurs. LanVision records this revenue when the seventy percent
payment due from IDX is fixed and determinable, which is
generally when the software implementation activities commence. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand
deposits, overnight deposits, and short-term commercial paper.
The long-term debt agreement See Note3. requires
LanVision to maintain a minimum cash balance of $4,800,000
through April29, 2003, at which time the amount is reduced
to $4,300,000 through July29, 2003, at which time the
amount is reduced to $3,800,000, which will be maintained
through the maturity of the loan in July 2004. Receivables Accounts and contract receivables are comprised
of amounts owed LanVision for licensed software, professional
services, including maintenance services and application-hosting
activities and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$400,000 at January31, 2003 and 2002. Contracts with
individual customers and resellers determine when receivables
are due. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts,
each unpaid receivable is reviewed quarterly with the
appropriate LanVision Client Manager to determine the payment
status based upon the most currently available information as to
the status of the receivables, the customer comments, if any,
and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the
customer preventing the payment thereof. Corrective action, if
necessary, is taken by LanVision to resolve open issues related
to unpaid receivables. During these quarterly reviews, LanVision
determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
or resellers to make required payments. Concentrations Financial instruments, which potentially expose
LanVision to concentrations of credit risk, as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No105,
Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with
Concentrations of Credit Risk, consist primarily of accounts
receivable. LanVisions accounts receivable are
concentrated in the healthcare industry. However,
LanVisions customers typically have been well-established
hospitals, medical facilities, or major Health Information
Systems companies that resell LanVisions products that
have good credit histories and payments have been received
within normal time frames for the industry. However, some
hospitals and 35 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued medical facilities have experienced significant
operating losses as a result of limits on third-party
reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental
entities and extended payment of receivables from these entities
is not uncommon. To date, LanVision has relied on a limited number
of customers and remarketing partners for a substantial portion
of its total revenues. LanVision expects that a significant
portion of its future revenues will continue to be generated by
a limited number of customers and its remarketing partners. The
failure to obtain new customers or expand sales through
remarketing partners, the loss of existing customers or
reduction in revenues from existing customers could materially
and adversely affect LanVisions operating results See
Note6. LanVision currently buys all of its hardware and
some major software components of its Healthcare Information
Access Systems from third-party vendors. Although there are a
limited number of vendors capable of supplying these components,
management believes that other suppliers could provide similar
components on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however,
could cause a delay in system implementations and a possible
loss of revenues, which could adversely affect operating results. Other Current Assets Other current assets are primarily: prepaid
insurance, commissions, maintenance, deposits, and prepaid
expenses related to future revenues. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line depreciation,
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated
useful lives are as follows   
Computer equipment and software
3-4 years
Office equipment
5 years
Office furniture and fixtures
7 years
Leasehold improvements
Life of lease
Depreciation expense for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
$383,806, $385,634 and $542,530, respectively. Leased computer equipment and software meeting
certain criteria are capitalized and the present value of the
related lease payments is recorded as a liability. Depreciation
of the capitalized lease assets is computed on the straight-line
method over the term of the lease. Normal repair and maintenance is expensed as
incurred. Replacements are capitalized and the property and
equipment accounts are relieved of the items being replaced or
disposed of, or if no longer of value. The related cost and
accumulated deprecation of the disposed assets are eliminated
and any gain or loss on disposition is included in the results
of operations in the year of disposal. Capitalized Software Development
Costs Software development costs are accounted for in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No86, Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the
planning and designing phase of software development, including
coding and testing activities necessary to establish
technological feasibility are classified as product research and
development and are expensed as incurred. Once technological
feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred
in development, including coding, testing, and product quality
assurance, are capitalized and subsequently reported at the
lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. LanVision
capitalized $600,000, $500,000 and $420,000 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. 36 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Research and development expense, net of
capitalized amounts, was $2,195,315, $2,154,949 and $2,702,576
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization is provided on a product-by-product
basis over the estimated economic life of the software, not to
exceed three years, using the straight-line method. Amortization
commences when a product is available for general release to
customers. Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in
excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at
the date of such determination. Amortization expense was
$400,000, $300,000 and $300,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Accrued Other Expenses Accrued other expenses at January31, 2002
and 2001 include warranty reserves, accrued franchise and
property taxes, professional fees and other liabilities. Income Taxes The provisions for income taxes are accounted for
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the
asset and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Stock Options Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
establishes a fair value method of financial accounting and
reporting for stock-based compensation plans. LanVision elected
to continue to account for stock options under the intrinsic
value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and, accordingly, has adopted the disclosure only provisions
of Statement 123. At January31, 2003 LanVision had three
stock-based compensation plans, which are more fully disclosed
in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No
stock-based compensation cost is reflected in the net income, as
all options granted under the plans had exercise prices equal to
the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date
of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net
earnings and earnings per share as if LanVision had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, to stock-based employee
compensation.

37 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Other Income Other income, net, in the first quarter of fiscal
2000, results primarily from the gain on the sale of the data
center in February 2000 for $2,900,000. LanVision entered into a
Service Provider Agreement with the purchaser to continue to use
the data center through February 2003. Net Earnings Per Common Share The net earnings per common share are computed in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No128, Earnings per Share. The basic net earnings
per common share are computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. The
diluted net earnings per common share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if Stock Options, Stock Purchase Plan
commitments and Warrants were exercised into Common Stock, under
certain circumstances, that then would share in the earnings of
LanVision. The following is the calculation of the basic and
diluted net earnings per share of common stock.

The diluted earnings per share for the fiscal

outstanding Stock Options and the 750,000 Warrants because the
inclusion would be antidilutive. 2.Operating
Leases LanVision rents office and data center space and
equipment under noncancelable operating leases that expire at
various times through fiscal 2006. Future minimum lease payments
under noncancelable operating leases for the next four fiscal
years are as follows: 2003, $434,270; 2004, $32,821; 2005 9,007; 2006, $5,690 each year. Rent expense was $178,189 139,047 and $217,000 for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. 3.Long-term Debt
and Capitalized Leases In 1998, LanVision issued a $6,000,000 note to
The HillStreet Fund, L.P., which bears interest at 12%, payable
monthly. The note is repayable in quarterly installments of
$500,000 through July 2004. LanVision has the option to prepay
at any time, in full, the outstanding balance of the note upon
the payment of a Special Prepayment Fee. The Special Prepayment
Fee shall be equal to the amount of the Yield Guarantee to
Maturity of 25%, discounted to the present value to the date of
payment in full of the Loan, using an assumed discount rate of
6%, minus the amount of the interest prepaid on:
September5, 2000, in the amount of 38 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 1,000,000, April2, 2001, in the amount of
$500,000, and March 13, 2002, in the amount of $500,000, all of
which will be compounded at an assumed interest rate of 6%
through the date of the payment in full of the Loan. The note is
secured by all of the assets of LanVision and the loan
agreement, as amended, restricts LanVision from incurring
additional indebtedness for borrowed money, including
capitalized leases, limits certain investments, restricts
substantial asset sales, capital expenditures, cash dividends,
stock repurchases, and mergers and consolidations with
unaffiliated entities without lender consent. In addition,
LanVision is required to meet certain financial covenants,
including minimum levels of revenues, earnings, and net worth.
Also, the loan agreement requires LanVision to maintain a
minimum cash balance of $4,800,000 through April29, 2003,
at which time the amount is reduced to $4,300,000 through
July29, 2003, at which time the amount is reduced to
$3,800,000, which will be maintained through the maturity of the
loan in July 2004. In connection with the issuance of the note,
LanVision issued Warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of Common
Stock of LanVision at $387 per share at any time through
July16, 2008. The Warrants are subject to customary
antidilution and registration rights provisions. Under the terms of the loan agreement, LanVision
has guaranteed the lender that the increase in the market value
of the stock underlying the Warrants, at the time of loan
maturity, over the exercise price plus the 12% interest paid on
the loan will yield the lender a 25% compound annual return. If
the yield from the Warrants plus interest paid does not provide
the lender with the 25% guaranteed compound annual return,
LanVision is required to pay the additional amount in cash at
the time of maturity. Accordingly, LanVision is accruing
interest on the loan at a 25% compound interest rate, regardless
of the market value of the stock and the inherent value of the
Warrants. Assuming that the Warrants have no value, the maximum
amount of the accrued and unpaid interest at maturity in July
2004 will be $5,238,618. Should the Warrant, which has a
purchase price of $387 per share, have any value, then the
value of the Warrant would reduce the amount of the accrued and
unpaid interest required to be paid at maturity by such value. In addition, the founders of LanVision have
consented to certain restrictions on the sale or transfer of
their shares. Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:
fiscal year 2003, $2,000,000 and 2004, $1,000,000. LanVision believes the fair market value of the
long-term debt and its accompanying Warrants approximates the
carrying value based on the term, interest rate and maturity
that LanVision believes is currently available to it. LanVision was in compliance with all of the
amended terms and conditions of the loan agreement as of
January31, 2003. During fiscal year 2002 LanVision acquired
computer equipment and related software for a new
application-hosting services data center, which are accounted
for as capitalized leases. The amount of the leased assets by
category are: computer equipment $372,705; computer software
$196,799; and prepaid maintenance and expenses $84,626, for a
total of $654,130 in new assets. The leases are payable monthly
in installments of $19,991, through August 2005 and an
additional amount of $8,323, through December 2005. The present
value of the future lease payments upon lease inception was
$654,130 using the interest rates implicit in the lease
agreements at the inception of the leases. 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

At the end of fiscal 2002, LanVision had a net
operating loss carry forward of approximately $28,000,000, which
begins to expire in 2009. LanVision also has an Alternative
Minimum Tax credit carry forward of approximately $35,000, which
has an unlimited carry forward period. LanVision is in a tax
loss carry forward position, and is unable to recognize a tax
benefit for losses because utilization of a tax benefit for such
losses is not assured. 5.Retirement
Plan LanVision has established a 401k retirement
plan that covers substantially all employees. Company
contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. To date, no Company contributions have been
made to the plan. 6.Major
Customers During fiscal 2002, three customers, exclusive of
our remarketing partner, accounted for 12%, 8%, and 8% of total
revenues. During fiscal 2001, three customers, exclusive of our
remarketing partner, accounted for 11%, 6%, and 7% of total
revenues. During fiscal 2000, three customers accounted for 11 10%, and 8% of total revenues. At January31, 2003 and
2002, 47% and 38%, respectively, of LanVisions accounts
receivable were due from three customers excluding remarketing
partners. At January31, 2003 and 2002 approximately, 37%
and 38%, respectively, of LanVisions accounts receivables
were due from remarketing partners. 7.Stock Option
Plans LanVision has elected to follow Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations, in
accounting for its stock options because, as discussed below,
the alternative fair value method of accounting provided for
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires use of
option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing stock options. Accordingly, LanVision adopted the
disclosure only provisions of Statement123. All of
LanVisions stock options have been issued with an exercise
price equal to the estimated fair market value of the underlying
stock at the date of grant. Accordingly, under Opinion25,
no compensation expense is recognized. 41 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued LanVisions Employee Stock Option Plan
authorizes the grant of options to employees for up to 825,000
shares of LanVisions Common Stock. The options granted
have terms of ten years or less and generally vest and become
fully exercisable ratably over three years of continuous
employment from the date of grant, except with respect to 22,275
options which were granted in fiscal 1995, and became fully
vested and exercisable on December1, 1996. At
January31, 2003, options to purchase 500,278 shares of
LanVisions Common Stock have been granted and are
outstanding under the Plan. LanVisions Non-Employee Directors Stock
Option Plan authorizes the grant of options for up to 100,000
shares of LanVisions Common Stock. All options granted
have terms of ten years or less, and vest and become fully
exercisable ratably over three years of continuous service as a
Director from the date of grant. Options for 50,000 shares have
been granted under this plan, of which 35,000 options are
exercisable and vested. In addition, non-qualified stock options
to purchase 5,000 shares were granted to a Director in April
1996, and are exercisable and vested. LanVision also issued non-qualified stock options
to purchase 99,841 shares of LanVisions Common Stock to
two employees prior to the initial public offering of
LanVisions Common Stock. Of the total, 69,778 were granted
in fiscal 1995, with an exercise price of $100 per share, and
expired in fiscal 2000. The remaining 30,063 options were
granted in 1990, with a term of approximately eleven years and
became exercisable in 1991 at an aggregate price of $100. Stock
options for 10,000 shares were exercised in fiscal 1999 and
20,063 shares were exercised in fiscal 2000. Pro forma information regarding the net earnings
and net earnings per common share is required by Statement 123,
and has been determined as if LanVision had accounted for its
stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. The
fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2001 and 2000: risk-free
interest rates of 450% in 2001 and 515% in 2000; a dividend
yield of zero percent; a volatility factor of the expected
market price of LanVisions Common Stock of 1011 in 2001
and 935 in 2000, and a weighted average expected life of the
options of five years. No options were granted in 2002. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because LanVisions stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
LanVisions opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock
options. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over
the average vesting period of the options. LanVisions pro
forma information is as follows

The Employee Stock Option Plan contains change of
control provisions whereby any outstanding options subject to
vesting, which have not fully vested as of the date of the
change in control, shall automatically vest and become
immediately exercisable. One of the change in control provisions
is deemed to occur if there is a change in beneficial ownership,
or authority to vote, directly or indirectly, securities
representing 20% or more of the total of all of LanVisions
then outstanding voting securities, unless through a transaction
arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval of the Board
of Directors. Other change in control provisions relate to
mergers and acquisitions or a determination of change in control
by LanVisions Board of Directors. 8.Stock Purchase
Plan LanVision has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
under which employees may purchase up to 500,000 shares of
Common Stock. Under the plan, eligible employees may elect to
contribute, through payroll deductions, up to 10% of their base
pay to a trust during any plan year, July 1 through
June30, of the following year. At June30 of each
year, the plan acquires for the benefit of the employees shares
of Common Stock at the lesser of a85% of the Fair Market
Value of the Common Stock on July1, of the prior year, or
b85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on
June30, of the current year. During fiscal year 2002, 23,059 shares were
purchased at the price of $123 per share; in 2001, 15,707
shares were purchased at the price of $123 per share; and in
2000, 21,145 shares were purchased at the price of $101 per
share. The purchase price at June30, 2003, will be
85% of the lower of athe closing price on July1,
2002 $299 or b85% of the closing price on June 30,
2003. 43 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 9.Commitments
and Contingencies Maintenance Agreements, Warranties, and
Indemnities LanVision warrants to customers that its software
will meet certain performance requirements for an initial
limited warranty period. LanVision has maintenance agreements to
provide services in future periods after the expiration of the
initial limited warranty period. LanVision invoices customers in
accordance with the agreements and records the invoicing as
deferred revenues and recognizes the revenues ratably over the
term of the maintenance agreements. LanVisions standard
agreements with its customers usually include provisions to
indemnify them from and against third party claims, liabilities,
damages, and expenses arising out of LanVisions operation
of its business or any negligent act or omission of LanVision. Application-hosting Services LanVision enters into long-term agreements to
provide document imaging/management and workflow services to its
healthcare customers on an outsourced basis from a central data
center. LanVision guarantees specific up-time and
response time performance standards, which, if not
met may result in reduced revenues, as a penalty, for the month
in which the standards are not met. Employment Agreements LanVision has entered into employment agreements
with its officers and employees that generally provide annual
salary, a minimum bonus, discretionary bonus, stock incentive
provisions, and severance arrangements. Reserved Common Stock LanVision has reserved 1,307,059 shares of the
Common Stock authorized for issuance in connection with various
Stock Option and Employee Stock Purchase Plans, and 750,000
shares for the Warrants issued in connection with the long-term
debt. Litigation There are claims pending against LanVision and
its subsidiary. Based on a review of such litigation with legal
counsel, LanVision believes any resulting liability would not
have a material affect on LanVisions consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 10.Quarterly
