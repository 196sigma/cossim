To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
WestCoast Hospitality Corporation
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' and
partners' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of WestCoast Hospitality Corporation formerly Cavanaughs
Hospitality Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1999, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended October
31, 1997, the two months ended December 31, 1997 and the years ended December
31, 1998 and 1999, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for start-up activities in 1999 as
required by a Statement of Position issued by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

- 
1.  Organization      Effective December 31, 1999, Cavanaughs Hospitality Corporation
acquired all of the outstanding stock of WestCoast Hotels, Inc. In
February 2000, the Company changed its name to WestCoast Hospitality
Corporation. All references herein to WestCoast Hospitality Corporation
or WestCoast refer to the consolidated entity including Cavanaughs
Hospitality Corporation as the predecessor entity. WestCoast Hospitality
Corporation is a hotel operating company that owns, operates,
franchises, acquires, develops, renovates and repositions full service
hotels in the Western United States under its proprietary brand names,
Cavanaughs R and WestCoast R. Substantially all of WestCoast
assets, including the hotels, are owned by or for the benefit of
WestCoast Hospitality Limited Partnership WHLP formerly Cavanaughs
Hospitality Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership.
WestCoast Hospitality Corporation manages the day to day operations of
the partnership in its capacity as sole general partner.
At December 31, 1997, the Company controlled and operated eight hotel
properties. At December 31, 1998, the Company controlled and operated 19
hotel properties. As of December 31, 1999, the Company has ownership
interests and operated 24 hotel properties, managed an additional 9
properties and franchised an additional 13 properties, totaling 46
hotels in 9 states, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii,
Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Additionally, the Company
provides computerized ticketing for entertainment events and arranges
Broadway and other entertainment event productions. Also, during the
second quarter of 1999, the Company launched TicketsWest.com, an
Internet ticketing service offering consumers up-to-the-minute
information on live entertainment and the ability to make real-time
ticket purchases to events through the website. The Company owns and
manages ticketing operations in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and
Washington. The Company also leases retail and office space in buildings
owned by the Company and manages residential and commercial properties
for others in Idaho, Montana and Washington.
The consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 1999 include the accounts of WestCoast Hospitality
Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiaries, its general and limited
partnership interest in WHLP, a 50% interest in a limited partnership
and its equity basis investment in three limited partnerships. All of
these entities are collectively referred to as the Company or
WestCoast. All significant intercompany transactions and amounts have
been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Prior Restructuring
In November 1997, the Company distributed certain of its operations
consisting of subsidiaries, partnership investments or divisions of the
Company to the existing stockholders as they were dissimilar to the
predominant business of the Company. These operations consisted
primarily of real estate development, a wholesale dairy processor and a
long-term residence inn operation. These operations have historically
been managed and financed autonomously, are being operated autonomously
and do not have material financial commitments, guarantees or contingent
liabilities associated with the Company. Accordingly, these operations
have been excluded from the consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented. The effects of excluding the subsidiaries,
investments or divisions are recorded as a contribution from or
distribution to stockholders and partners.                    37 1.    Organization, Continued     Prior Restructuring, Continued
In November 1997, the Company contributed all of its assets to WHLP
in exchange for the general partnership interest which holds a 1%
interest in WHLP and limited partnership interests. Operating Units OP
Units of WHLP were issued as limited partnership interests. OP Units
are convertible to common stock of WestCoast Hospitality Corporation on
a one-for-one basis.
Prior to January 1, 1998, the combined financial statements included
the operations of WestCoast Hospitality Corporation including its
merged and predecessor entities which included Barbieri Investment
Company BIC and G & B: Lincoln Building Limited Partnership Lincoln
Building as these entities were under common control. On January 1,
1998, the Company issued common stock and OP Units in WHLP to the
partners of Lincoln Building in exchange for the assets and liabilities
of Lincoln Building.
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company changed its fiscal year end
from October 31 to December 31; therefore, the consolidated financial
statements presented herein are audited as of and for the two months
ended December 31, 1997 with comparative unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the two months ended December 31, 1996.
2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies       Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments
with remaining maturities at time of purchase of three months or
less. The Company places its cash with high credit quality
institutions. At times, cash balances may be in excess of federal
insurance limits.
The Company maintains several trust accounts for owners of real
properties which it manages. These cash accounts are not owned by
the Company and therefore, are not included in the consolidated
financial statements. At December 31, 1999, these accounts totaled
approximately $1,824,000.
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage products held
for sale at the restaurants operated by the Company. Inventories are
valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out
basis, or net realizable value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term as
follows          Buildings                    25-40 years
Equipment                    5-20 years
Furniture and fixtures             15 years
Landscaping and land improvements        15 years                    38  2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued       Property and Equipment, Continued
Major additions and betterments are capitalized. Costs of
maintenance and repairs which do not improve or extend the lives of
the respective assets are expensed currently. When items are
disposed of, the related costs and accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in
operations. Management of the Company periodically reviews the net
carrying value of all properties to determine whether there has been
a permanent impairment of value and assesses the need for any
write-downs in carrying value.
Interest Capitalization
The Company capitalizes interest costs during the construction
period for qualifying assets. During the year ended October 31,
1997, the two months ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 and the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company capitalized
approximately $6,000, $12,000, $17,000, $363,000 and $550,000 of
interest costs, respectively.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of brand name and goodwill
attributable to the purchase price of acquisitions which were in
excess of the estimated fair values of net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired. These assets are being amortized over
20-40 years. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1998 and 1999
was approximately $302,000 and $365,000, respectively. Intangible
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may
not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if expected
future cash flows of the assets are less than their carrying values.
Other Assets
Other assets primarily include amounts expended for management
and marketing contracts, deferred loan fees, purchase option
payments, straight-line rental income, a minority interest in a
limited liability company and investments in partnerships. The cost
of management and marketing contracts are amortized over the
weighted-average remaining term of the contracts. Deferred loan fees
are amortized using the interest method over the term of the related
loan agreement. The Company has deferred purchase option payments
made pursuant to purchase agreements for hotel properties which are
currently being leased and operated by the Company. If the option is
exercised, the option payments will be amortized as part of the
purchase price of the hotels. If the option is not exercised, the
option payments will be charged to operations.
The Company investment in the limited liability company is
accounted for under the cost method. Investment in a partnership
over which the Company can exercise significant influence is
accounted for by the equity method, under which the Company
recognizes its proportionate share of partnership earnings and
treats distributions as a reduction in its investment.
Income Taxes
Prior to their merger, WestCoast Hospitality Corporation and BIC
filed separate federal and state income tax returns. WHLP and the
other partnerships which are partially or wholly owned by WestCoast
Hospitality Corporation are not tax paying entities. However, the
income tax attributes of these partnerships flow through to the
respective partners of the partnerships.
Lease Income
The Company records rental income from operating leases which
contain fixed escalation clauses on the straight-line method. The
difference between income earned and lease payments received from
the tenants is included in other assets on the consolidated balance
sheets. Rental                    39  2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued       Lease Income, Continued
income from retail lessees which is contingent upon the lessees'
revenues is recorded as income in the period earned.
Earnings Per Share
Net income per share - basic is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Net income per share - diluted is computed by adjusting
net income by the effect of the minority interest related to OP
Units and increasing the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding by the effect of the OP Units and the additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential
common shares stock options had been issued, to the extent that
such issuance would be dilutive. There is no difference between
basic and diluted earnings per share because the stock options are
antidilutive in 1998 and 1999.
Due to the combination of the companies and partnerships,
historical earnings per share information prior to the combination
described in Note 1 is not relevant or meaningful. Therefore, only
pro forma earnings per share for the year ended October 31, 1997 has
been presented based upon the number of common shares of WestCoast
Hospitality Corporation which were outstanding after the merger of
the companies and partnerships.
Accounting for Stock Options
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company has chosen to measure compensation cost for stock-based
employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and to provide the
disclosure only requirements of SFAS 123.
New Accounting Pronouncement
In April 1998, Statement of Position SOP 98-5, Reporting on
the Costs of Start-up Activities was issued. The SOP requires that
all costs of start-up activities and organization costs be expensed
as incurred. The Company adopted the provisions of SOP 98-5 on
January 1, 1999 and reported the change as a cumulative effect of an
accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations. The
adoption of SOP 98-5 resulted in a charge to operations of $133,000,
which is net of $68,000 of income taxes.
Reclassifications
For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company redefined its
operating segments as 1 Hotels and Restaurants; 2
TicketsWest.com entertainment; and 3 Real Estate Division. With
the acquisition of WestCoast Hotels, Inc. on December 31, 1999, a
fourth segment, Franchise and Central Services, was created.
However, this segment will not have any operations until 2000.
During 1999, the Company also identified most selling, general and
administrative costs, property operating costs and depreciation and
amortization expenses that were previously undistributed to the
segments as costs of the respective segments. Accordingly, the
presentation of the consolidated statements of operations for all
periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the 1999
classifications. These reclassifications and others to conform the
prior financial statements to the 1999 presentation had no effect on
net income loss or retained earnings as previously reported.                    40  2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued       Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

facility with a consortium of banks. In December 1998, the Company
received a commitment to amend the credit facility to increase the total
amount available under the facility to $100 million. In December 1999,
in connection with the WestCoast Hotels, Inc. acquisition see Note 13,
the credit facility was amended to increase the total amount available
under the facility to $120 million. The credit facility is
collateralized by certain property and requires that the Company
maintain certain financial ratios, minimum levels of cash flows and
restricts the payment of dividends. Any outstanding borrowings bear
interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR. At December 31, 1999, the
interest rate on outstanding borrowings ranged from 844% to 875%. The
weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 727% and
847% at December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively. Interest only
payments are due monthly. The credit facility matures in 2003. The
credit facility requires the initial payment of a 1% fee plus an annual
standby fee ranging from 025% to 050% 035% at December 31, 1999.
Additionally, in connection with the December 1999 amendment, a $950,000
fee was paid. The Company was in compliance with all required covenants
at December 31, 1998 and 1999. The debt agreement allows the Company to
pay dividends as long as certain minimum financial ratios are
maintained. At December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company was restricted
from paying any dividends.
In January 2000, the Company obtained a rate cap protection
contract for $36 million of its credit facility. For a period of 3
years, the Company is protected from LIBOR exceeding 9%. The rate
protection contract is transferable.
At December 31, 1998, in addition to the $76,300,000 outstanding
under the credit facility, the Company also had a $6,180,000 note
payable to the lead bank under the credit facility. Interest only at a
variable rate 779% at December 31, 1998 was payable monthly. This
note was paid in full in January 1999.

rights, preferences and privileges will be determined by the Board of
Directors. The stockholders of the former companies which were merged
received a total of 7,072,025 newly issued shares in exchange for all of
their outstanding shares.
In April 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of
5,951,250 shares of common stock at $15 per share. The net proceeds,

10.  Operating Lease Commitments      The Company leases building space under an operating lease agreement
which requires monthly payments of $4,500 through March 2009. The
monthly payments can be increased yearly for inflation.
In 1998, the Company began leasing land at one of its hotel
properties which requires monthly payments based on either gross
receipts from the hotel or a monthly minimum, whichever is greater,
through July 2014, with two 10-year renewal options. At December 31,
1999, monthly minimum lease payments were $5,631. The monthly minimum
payments can be adjusted every three years based on the average monthly
payments. In 1998, the Company began leasing land at one of its hotel
properties, which requires monthly payments of $5,454 through May 2062.
The monthly payments are subject to adjustment annually.
In October 1997, the Company began operating a hotel in Yakima,
Washington under an operating lease and purchase option agreement. The
lease agreement is for a period of 15 years with two five-year renewal
options. The Company pays all operating costs of the hotel plus monthly
lease payments of $35,000 through September 2003. Commencing October
2003, the monthly lease requirement will be $52,083 and monthly payments
shall increase by $5,208 each year thereafter. The Company agreed to a
$10 million option payment which allows the purchase of this hotel at a
fixed price. One-half of this option payment was paid in cash and the
remaining $500,000 is payable in October 2002. The option is exercisable
by the Company between March and September 2003 for a total purchase
price of $6,250,000. If the Company exercises its purchase option, the
option payments made by the Company will be applied against the total
purchase price.
Through the WestCoast Hotels, Inc. acquisition, the Company began
operating a hotel in Bellevue, Washington in January 2000 with an
operating lease and purchase option agreement. The                    46  10.  Operating Lease Commitments, Continued     lease agreement expires on December 31, 2003. The Company pays monthly

2002 through December 2003 solely at the Company option. The total
purchase price of the option is $12 million less amounts representing
the principal portion of the underlying property debt which are included
in additional rent.
Assuming the Company exercises its purchase options for the Bellevue
hotel in July 2002 and the Yakima hotel in March 2003, total payments
due under all of the Company leases at December 31, 1999 are as

12.  Employee Benefit and Stock Plans       1998 Stock Incentive Plan
The 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan was adopted by the Board
of Directors in 1998. The Plan authorizes the grant or issuance of
various option or other awards. The maximum number of shares which
may be awarded under the Plan is 1,200,000 shares, subject to
adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar events. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the
Plan and establishes to whom, the type and the terms and conditions,
including the exercise period, the awards are granted.
Nonqualified stock options may be granted for any term specified
by the Compensation Committee and may be granted at less than fair
market value, but not less than par value on the date of grant.
Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees and must be
granted at an exercise price at least equal to fair market value on
the date of grant and have a ten year exercise period. The maximum
fair market value of shares which may be issued pursuant to
incentive stock options granted under the Plan to any individual in
any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Stock Appreciation Rights
SARs may also be granted in connection with stock options or other
awards. SARs typically will provide for payments to the holder based
upon increases in the price of the common stock over the exercise
price of the related option or award, but alternatively may be based
upon other criteria such as book value. Other awards such as
restricted stock awards, dividend equivalent awards, performance
awards or deferred stock awards may also be granted under the Plan
by the Compensation Committee.
During 1998 and 1999, the Compensation Committee granted 889,919
and 263,915 options, respectively. All options were designated as
nonqualified options, with an exercise price equal to or in excess
of fair market value on the date of grant and for a term of ten
years. Fifty percent of each recipients' options will vest on the
fourth anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining 50% will
vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. The vesting
schedule will change if, beginning one year after the option grant
date, the stock price of the common stock reaches the following
target levels measured as a percentage increase over the exercise
price for 60 consecutive trading days              Stock Price            Percent of Option

Remaining options available for grant at December 31, 1998 and
1999 were 364,131 and 222,251, respectively. None of the options
outstanding at December 31, 1999 are exercisable.
The Company uses the intrinsic value method versus the fair
value method of recording compensation expense associated with its
stock options. Accordingly, since all options were granted at
exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair market value of
the common stock on the grant date, no compensation expense has been
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Had
compensation cost for the Company stock option plan been
determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent with
the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company net income and income per
share for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 would have been
decreased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands,

stock to certain members of senior management. Twenty percent of
these shares were issued in 1998 and 1999 and twenty percent will be
issued in each subsequent year provided such employee is an employee
of the Company at that time. The Company recorded compensation
expense of approximately $165,000 during each of the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1999 associated with these grants.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 1998, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to
assist employees of the Company in acquiring a stock ownership
interest in the Company. A maximum of 300,000 shares of common stock
is reserved for issuance under this plan. The Employee Stock
Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at
a discount through payroll deductions. No employee may purchase more
than $25,000 worth of common stock under this plan in any calendar
year. During the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, 18,752 and
14,245 shares were purchased under this plan for approximately
$184,000 and $101,000, respectively.
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company and employees contribute to the Cavanaughs
Hospitality Corporation Amended and Restated Retirement and Savings
Plan. The defined contribution plan was created for the benefit of
substantially all employees of the Company. The Company makes
contributions of up to 3% of an employee compensation based on a
vesting schedule and                    50  12.  Employee Benefit and Stock Plans, Continued       Defined Contribution Plan, Continued
eligibility requirements set forth in the plan document. Company
contributions to the plan for the year ended October 31, 1997, the
two months ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 and the years ended
December 31, 1998 and 1999 were approximately $97,000, $18,000,
$20,000, $161,000 and $204,000, respectively.
Upon the acquisition of WestCoast Hotels, Inc., the Company
acquired two additional defined contribution plans.
13.  Acquisitions       Year Ended December 31, 1999
During 1999, the Company made the following acquisitions, all of
which have been accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of these entities
have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since
their respective dates of acquisition.
On October 26, 1999, WestCoast acquired substantially all of the
assets of The Show Terminal, LLC d.b.a. Colorado Neighborhood Box
Office, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Colorado
Neighborhood Box Office sells tickets to entertainment events
throughout the Colorado Springs area. On November 1, 1999, WestCoast
acquired Oregon Ticket Company, Inc. d.b.a. Fastixx, headquartered
in Portland, Oregon. The acquisition increased the number of
TicketsWest.comTM outlets from 23 to 116 and expanded the
entertainment division geographic presence into Oregon and Western
Washington.
The total purchase price of Colorado Neighborhood Box Office and
Fastixx of $3,456,000 was comprised of $2,149,000 cash, the issuance
of a $255,000 note payable, and the issuance of 138,884 shares of
the Company common stock which was recorded at its fair value
based on quoted market price of $1,052,000. Additionally, the
Fastixx purchase price included contingent consideration to be paid
dependent upon the future operations of the company. The contingent
consideration will be accounted for as goodwill and will be
amortized accordingly when, and if, the contingency is removed and
additional consideration is paid. Goodwill related to these
acquisitions of approximately $3,282,000 is being amortized over 20
years. The results of operations of these two acquisitions for the
year ended December 31, 1998 and the 1999 period prior to the
acquisition by the Company is not material.
Effective December 31, 1999, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding stock of WestCoast Hotels, Inc. This acquisition
resulted in the Company acquiring the following property interests
and contracts       o  100% interests in two hotels in the Seattle, Washington area
o  Limited or co-general partnership interests and management
agreements for three hotels in Seattle, Washington; La Jolla,
California and Phoenix, Arizona
o  Management contracts for 9 hotel properties
o  Franchise agreements for 13 hotel properties                    51  13.  Acquisitions, Continued       Year Ended December 31, 1999, Continued
The total purchase price of approximately $455 million
consisted of $214 million cash, issuance of $7 million bonds
payable and assumption of $172 million outstanding debt and other
liabilities of WestCoast Hotels, Inc. The $7 million bonds payable
are convertible into common stock of the Company at $15 per share.
The purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired consist
of working capital accounts, management and franchise contracts of
$51 million, property and equipment of $118 million and
partnership interests and purchase option contracts of $109
million. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net
assets acquired has been allocated to brand name and goodwill, which
will be amortized over 40 years using the straight-line method. The
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are included on the December
31, 1999 consolidated balance sheet.
Due to the timing of the WestCoast Hotels, Inc. acquisition, the
results of operations of WestCoast Hotels, Inc. will be included in
the consolidated results of operations of the Company commencing
January 1, 2000. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents
the consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the
acquisition of WestCoast Hotels, Inc. had occurred at January 1,
1999 in thousands, except per share data        Revenue                         $ 125,311

The above amounts are based upon certain assumptions and
estimates which the Company believes are reasonable and do not
reflect any benefit from economies which might be achieved from
combined operations. The pro forma results do not necessarily
represent results which would have occurred if the acquisition had
taken place on the bases assumed, nor are they indicative of the
results of future combined operations.

The Spokane, Washington acquisition was a lease with purchase
option. The purchase option was exercised in April 1998. The purchase
prices for the hotels were satisfied through a combination of the
payment of cash, the assumption of debt and the issuance of OP Units. As
part of the total purchase price above, WHLP issued 245,148 OP Units
which were valued at approximately $37 million.
All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of
these hotels have been included in the consolidated statement of
operations since their respective dates of acquisition. Total property
and equipment acquired was approximately $780 million and debt of
approximately $87 million was assumed in these acquisitions. The excess
purchase price of the assets over their historical cost bases has been
allocated to property and equipment and is being depreciated over the
estimated remaining useful life of the related assets approximately
15-40 years.
14.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined using
available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data and
to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates
presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the
Company could realize in a current market exchange.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate that value. Potential income tax ramifications
related to the realization of unrealized gains and losses that would be
incurred in an actual sale or settlement have not been taken into
consideration.
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and current liabilities are a reasonable estimate of their
fair values. The fair values of long-term debt and capital lease
obligations are based on the discounted value of contractual cash
flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered
for debt or capital lease obligations with similar remaining
maturities.
The estimated fair values of financial instruments at December 31,
1998 and 1999 are as follows in thousands                                1998              1999

Hotels and Restaurants; 2 TicketsWest.com; entertainment; 3 Real
Estate Division and 4 Franchise and Central Services. The Franchise
and Central Services segment represents the franchise and marketing
division of the Company, which was acquired with the WestCoast Hotels,
Inc. purchase. Due to the timing of the WestCoast Hotels, Inc.
acquisition, this segment had identifiable assets and capital
expenditures at December 31, 1999, but no operations will be reported
until 2000. Corporate services and other consists primarily of
miscellaneous revenues and expenses, cash and cash equivalents, certain
receivables and certain property and equipment, which are not
specifically associated with an operating segment.
TicketsWest.com has significant inter-segment revenues, which are
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Management reviews
and evaluates the operations of TicketsWest.com including the
inter-segment revenues. Therefore, the total revenues, including
inter-segment revenues are included in the segment information below.
Management reviews and evaluates the operating segments exclusive of
interest expense. Therefore, interest expense is not allocated to the
segments.                    54 15. Business Segments, Continued      Selected information with respect to the segments is as follows in
