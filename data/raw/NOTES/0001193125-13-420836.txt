Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Note 1 - Nature of Operations 
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries Greenbrier or the Company currently operate in three primary
business segments: Manufacturing; Wheels, Repair Parts; and Leasing Services. The three business segments are operationally integrated. With operations in the United States U.S., Mexico and Poland, the Manufacturing segment
produces double-stack intermodal railcars, conventional railcars, tank cars and marine vessels. The Wheels, Repair Parts segment performs railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance activities in North America as well as wheel and axle
servicing and production of a variety of parts for the railroad industry. The Leasing Services segment owns approximately 8,600 railcars and provides management services for approximately 224,000 railcars for railroads, shippers,
carriers, institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in North America. Greenbrier also produces railcar castings through an unconsolidated joint venture. 
Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Principles of consolidation - The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated upon consolidation. Unclassified Balance Sheet - The balance sheets of the Company are presented in an unclassified format as a result of significant leasing activities for which the current or non-current
distinction is not relevant. In addition, the activities of the Manufacturing; Wheels, Repair Parts; and Leasing Services segments are so intertwined that in the opinion of management, any attempt to separate the respective
balance sheet categories would not be meaningful and may lead to the development of misleading conclusions by the reader. 
Foreign currency translation - Certain operations outside the U.S., primarily in Poland, prepare financial statements in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year, while assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate
component of equity in other comprehensive income loss. The foreign currency translation adjustment balances were $49 million, $60 million and $19 million as of August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 
Cash and cash equivalents - Cash may temporarily be invested primarily in money market funds. All highly-liquid investments
with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. Restricted cash
- Restricted cash relates to amounts held in restricted accounts to support a target minimum rate of return as part of an agreement further described in Note 26 Variable Interest Entities and a pass through account for activity related to
management services provided for certain third party customers. Accounts receivable - Accounts receivable are
stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $39 million and $35 million as of August31, 2013 and 2012.  As of August31 In thousands
2013 2012 2011 Allowance for doubtful accounts Balance at beginning of period 3,525 3,913 3,931 Additions, net of reversals 543 641 351 Usage 285 663 673 Currency translation effect 111 366 304  Balance at end of period 3,894 3,525 3,913 
Inventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market primarily using the
first-in first-out method. Work-in-process includes material, labor and overhead. Leased railcars for syndication
- Leased railcars for syndication consist of newly-built railcars manufactured at one of the Companys facilities or railcars purchased from a third party, which have been placed on lease to a
44
The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report Table of Contents
customer and which the Company intends to sell to an investor with the lease attached. These railcars are not depreciated and are generally anticipated to be sold within six months of delivery of
the last railcar or six months from when the Company acquires the railcar from a third party. The Company does not believe any economic value of a railcar is lost in the first six months; therefore the Company does not depreciate these assets. In
the event the railcars are not sold, the railcars are transferred to Equipment on operating leases and depreciated. 
Equipment on operating leases, net - Equipment on operating leases is stated net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
to estimated salvage value is provided on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to thirty-five years. Management periodically reviews salvage value estimates based on current scrap prices and what the Company expects to
receive upon disposal. Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost net of
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives which are as follows:  DepreciableLife Buildings and improvements 1025years Machinery and equipment 315 years Other 37 years
Goodwill - Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair
market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if material changes in events or circumstances arise. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and if
the carrying value of these assets is in excess of fair value, the carrying value is reduced to the implied fair value. 
Intangible and other assets, net - Intangible assets are recorded when a portion of the purchase price of an acquisition is
allocated to assets such as customer contracts and relationships, trade names, certifications and backlog. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and include the following:
trade names, 5 years; and long-term customer agreements, 5 to 20 years. Other assets include loan fees and debt acquisition costs which are capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the life of the related borrowings. 
Impairment of long-lived assets - When changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long-lived assets
may not be recoverable, the assets are evaluated for impairment. If the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to estimated
realizable value is recognized in the current period. No impairment was recorded in the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Maintenance obligations - The Company is responsible for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the underlying
lease or management agreement. The estimated liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and age of railcar. The liability, included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, is reviewed periodically and updated based on maintenance
trends and known future repair or refurbishment requirements. Warranty accruals - Warranty costs are estimated
and charged to operations to cover a defined warranty period. The estimated warranty cost is based on history of warranty claims for each particular product type. For new product types without a warranty history, preliminary estimates are based on
historical information for similar product types. The warranty accruals, included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are reviewed periodically and updated based on warranty trends. 
Income taxes - The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for the
temporary effects of differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. As
a result, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on whether evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as
this requires us to estimate the probability of various possible outcomes. 
The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report 45 Table of Contents
The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Changes in assumptions may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax
provision. Noncontrolling interest - The Company has a joint venture with Grupo Industrial Monclova,
S.A. GIMSA that manufactures new railroad freight cars for the North American marketplace at GIMSAs existing manufacturing facility located in Frontera, Mexico. Each party owns a 50% interest in the joint venture. The financial results of
this operation are consolidated for financial reporting purposes as the Company maintains a controlling interest as evidenced by the right to appoint the majority of the board of directors, control over accounting, financing, marketing and
engineering, and approval and design of products. The noncontrolling interest reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements primarily represents the joint venture partners equity in this venture. 
Accumulated other comprehensive loss - Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax as appropriate, consisted of the
following:  In thousands

Revenue recognition - Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Railcars are generally manufactured, repaired or refurbished under firm orders from third parties. Revenue is recognized when new, refurbished or repaired railcars are completed, accepted by an
unaffiliated customer and contractual contingencies removed. Marine revenues are either recognized on the percentage of completion method during the construction period or on the completed contract method based on the terms of the contract. Cash
payments received prior to meeting revenue recognition criteria are accounted for in Deferred revenue. Operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease terms. Certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements whereby revenue is
earned based on utilization, car hire rates and terms specified in the lease agreement. The Company sells railcars with
leases attached to financial investors. In addition the Company will often perform management or maintenance services at market rates for these railcars. Pursuant to the guidance in ASC840-20-40, the Company evaluates the terms of any
remarketing agreements and any contractual provisions that represent retained risk and the level of retained risk based on those provisions. The Company applies a 10% threshold to determine whether the level of retained risk exceeds 10% of the
individual fair value of the rail cars delivered. For any contracts with multiple elements i.e. railcars, maintenance, management services, etc the Company allocates revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable
evidence of the fair value of each element in the arrangement.If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, the company will use its estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement
consideration among the elements.

Research and development - Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Research and development costs incurred for new product development during the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $20 million, $20 million and $30 million. 
Forward exchange contracts - Foreign operations give rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Forward
exchange contracts with established financial institutions are utilized to hedge a portion of such risk. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are deferred in other comprehensive income loss and recognized in earnings concurrent with the hedged
transaction or when the occurrence of the hedged transaction is no longer considered probable. Ineffectiveness is measured and any gain or loss is recognized in foreign exchange gain or loss. Even though forward exchange contracts are entered into
to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations, certain exposure remains, which may affect operating results. In addition, there is risk for counterparty non-performance. Interest rate instruments - Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on certain debt. The net cash amounts paid or received under the
agreements are accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense. Net earnings per share - Basic
earnings per common share EPS excludes the potential dilution that would occur if additional shares were issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants or conversion of bonds. Restricted share grants are treated as outstanding when issued and
restricted stock units are not treated as outstanding when issued. Restricted share grants and restricted stock units are included in weighted average basic common shares outstanding when calculating EPS when the Company is in a net earnings
position. Diluted EPS is calculated using the more dilutive of two approaches. The first approach includes the dilutive
effect of outstanding warrants and shares underlying the 2026 Convertible notes in the share count using the treasury stock method. The second approach supplements the first by including the if converted effect of the 2018 Convertible
notes. Under the if converted method debt issuance and interest costs, both net of tax, associated with the convertible notes are added back to net earnings and the share count is increased by the shares underlying the convertible notes.
The 2026 Convertible notes would only be included in the calculation of both approaches if the current stock price is greater than the initial conversion price using the treasury stock method. 
Stock-based compensation - The value, at the date of grant, of stock awarded under restricted share grants and
restricted stock unit grants is amortized as compensation expense over the lesser of the vesting period of one to five years or to the recipients eligible retirement date. Compensation expense recognized related to restricted stock for the years
ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $63 million, $88 million and $71 million and was recorded in Selling and administrative on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Management estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the U.S. requires judgment on the part of management to arrive at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates may affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities within the financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 
The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report 47 Table of Contents
Initial Adoption of Accounting Policies - In the first quarter of 2013, the
Company adopted an accounting standard update that increased the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. The standard eliminated the option of presenting other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and instead
requires the Company to present other comprehensive income as either a single statement of comprehensive income combined with net income or as two separate but continuous statements. The adoption of this accounting standard update did impact the
presentation of other comprehensive income, as the Company has elected to present two separate but consecutive statements, but did not have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In the first quarter of 2013, the Company adopted an accounting standard update regarding how entities test goodwill for impairment. This
accounting standard update is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This
update impacts testing steps only and therefore the adoption did not have an effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Prospective Accounting Changes - In July 2012, an accounting standard update was issued regarding the testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. This update is intended to
reduce the cost and complexity of testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. This update is
effective for the Company as of September1, 2013. This update impacts testing steps only, and therefore adoption will not have an effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. 
In February 2013, an accounting standard update was issued which amended prior reporting requirements with respect to comprehensive
income by requiring additional disclosures about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss by component. This update is effective for the Company as of September1, 2013. As this accounting standard update impacts
disclosure only, the adoption of this update is not expected to have an impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
Note 3 - Restructuring 
During 2013, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to sell or close certain Wheels, Repair Parts
facilities to enhance margins and improve capital efficiency and anticipates completing the restructuring plan during 2014. Restructuring charges related to this plan totaled $27 million for the year ended August31, 2013 and were included in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All of the restructuring charges for the year ended August31, 2013 and the restructuring reserve as of August31, 2013 related to the Companys Wheels, Repair Parts segment. The
Company anticipates that there will be additional restructuring charges in 2014 as the Company completes the plan.  In thousands

Leased railcars for syndication consist of newly-built railcars manufactured at one of the Companys facilities
or railcars purchased from a third party, which have been placed on lease to a customer and which the Company intends to sell to an investor with the lease attached. These railcars are not depreciated and are generally anticipated to be sold within
six months of delivery of the last railcar or six months from when the Company acquires the railcar from a third party. The Company does not depreciate these railcars because it does not believe any economic value of a railcar is lost in the first
six months. In the event the railcars are not sold, the railcars are transferred to Equipment on operating leases and depreciated. As of August31, 2013 Leased railcars for syndication were $685 million compared to $978 million as of
August31, 2012. 
Note 7 - Equipment on Operating Leases, net

Reduction in goodwill relates to the sale of the Companys roller
bearing operations in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. 2
Goodwill impairment relates to the non-cash goodwill impairment charge recognized as part of the Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis
as further discussed below. The Company performs a goodwill impairment test annually during the third
quarter. Goodwill is also tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists. The provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, require the Company to perform a
two-step impairment test on goodwill. The Company performed step one of the goodwill impairment test during the third quarter
of 2013. In the first step, the Company compared the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. The Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income
approach, the Company calculated the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimated the fair value based on observed market multiples for comparable
businesses. Results of the step one analysis indicated that the carrying amounts related to Wheels, Repair Parts were in excess of its fair value. Accordingly, the Company performed step two of the impairment analysis to determine the
amount, if any, of goodwill impairment to be recorded. In the second step, the Company compared the implied fair value of
goodwill to its carrying value. The implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business
combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities was considered the implied fair value of
goodwill. A non-cash impairment loss was recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill. The impairment loss was primarily due to a reduction in market multiples for
comparable businesses and updated estimated future cash flows. A pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $769million was recorded for the year ended August31, 2013 which relates to the Wheels, Repair Parts segment. 
The Companys goodwill balance as of August31, 2013 and 2012 related to our Wheels, Repair Parts segment. The gross
goodwill balance before accumulated goodwill impairment losses and other reductions was

The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report Table of Contents
Convertible senior notes, due 2018, bear interest at a fixed rate of
35%, paid semi-annually in arrears on April1st and
October1st. The convertible notes will mature on
April1, 2018, unless earlier repurchased by Greenbrier or converted in accordance with their terms. The convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with other senior unsecured debt. The convertible notes are convertible
into shares of the Companys common stock, at an initial conversion rate of 262838 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of $3805 per share. The initial conversion rate and conversion
price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, such as distributions, dividends or stock splits. There were $79 million in original debt issuance costs, included in Intangibles and other assets on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, which will be amortized using the effective interest method. The amortization expense is being included in Interest and foreign exchange on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Convertible senior notes, due 2026, bear interest at a fixed rate of 2375%, paid semi-annually in arrears on
May15th and November15th. In May 2013, the Company retired $529 million of its then $677
million outstanding notes pursuant to a scheduled put option. The Company may be required to also pay contingent interest of 0375% on the notes in certain circumstances. Greenbrier may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. On May15, 2016 and May15, 2021 or in the event of certain fundamental changes, holders can require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their
notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest. Payment on the convertible notes is guaranteed by substantially all of the Companys material domestic subsidiaries. The convertible senior
notes are convertible upon the occurrence of specified events into cash and shares, if any, of Greenbriers common stock at an initial conversion rate of 208125 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes which is equal to an initial
conversion price of $4805per share. The initial conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined. The value of the equity component was $149 million as of August31, 2013 and 2012. The debt
discount associated with the convertible senior notes was fully accreted using the effective interest rate method through May 2013 and the accretion expense was included in Interest and foreign exchange on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The pre-tax accretion of the debt discount was $25 million, $32 million and $30million for the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. Term loans are primarily composed of:  A senior term note with an initial balance of $1000 million, secured by a pool of leased railcars, maturing in March 2014. The note bears a
floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 1% with principal of $07 million paid quarterly in arrears and a balloon payment of $818 million due at maturity. The principal balance as of August31, 2013 was $831 million. An interest rate swap
agreement was entered into, on fifty percent of the initial balance, to swap the floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 1% to a fixed rate of 524%. At August31, 2013, the notional amount of the agreement was $416 million and matures in March
2014.  A senior term note with an initial balance of $500 million, secured by a pool of leased railcars, maturing in May 2015. The note bears a floating
interest rate of LIBOR plus 1% with principal of $03 million paid quarterly in arrears and a balloon payment of $412 million due at maturity.

Other term loans with an aggregate balance of $24 million as of August31, 2013 and maturity dates ranging from October 2013 to February 2018.
The notes payable, along with the revolving and operating lines of credit, contain certain covenants with
respect to the Company and various subsidiaries, the most restrictive of which, among other things, limit the ability to: incur additional indebtedness or guarantees; pay dividends or repurchase stock; enter into sale leaseback transactions; create
liens; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates, including joint ventures and non U.S. subsidiaries, including but not limited to loans, advances, equity investments and guarantees; enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of
substantially all the Companys assets; and enter into new lines of business. The covenants also require certain maximum ratios of debt to total capitalization and minimum levels of fixed charges interest and rent coverage.

The repayment of the $149 million of Convertible senior notes due 2026 is assumed to occur in 2016, which is the next date holders can require the
Company to repurchase all or a portion of the notes. 
Note 15 - Derivative Instruments 
Foreign operations give rise to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with established financial institutions are utilized to hedge a portion of that risk in Euro. Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on certain debt. The Companys foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges, and therefore the effective portion of unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
At August31, 2013 exchange rates, forward exchange contracts for the purchase of Polish Zloty and the sale of Euro aggregated $534
million. Adjusting the foreign currency exchange contracts to the fair value of the cash flow hedges at August31, 2013 resulted in an unrealized pre-tax loss of $03 million that was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The fair
value of the contracts is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities when there is a loss, or Accounts receivable when there is a gain, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the contracts mature at various dates through June 2014, any
such gain or loss remaining will be recognized in manufacturing revenue along with the related transactions. In the event that the underlying sales transaction does not occur or does not occur in the period designated at the inception of the hedge,
the amount classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be reclassified to the current years results of operations in Interest and foreign exchange. At August31, 2013, an interest rate swap agreement had a notional amount of $416 million and matures March 2014. The fair value of this cash flow hedge at August31, 2013 resulted in an
unrealized pre-tax loss of $13million. The loss is included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and the fair value of the contract is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As interest
expense on the underlying debt is recognized, amounts corresponding to the interest rate swap are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and charged or credited to interest expense. At August31, 2013 interest rates,
approximately $13 million would be reclassified to interest expense in the next 12 months. Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

On December16, 2010, the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of its common stock in an underwritten at-the-market
public offering at $2106 per share, less expenses resulting in net proceeds of $628 million. In January 2011, the
stockholders approved the 2010 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan formerly known as the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan as amended. This plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted shares,
restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights. There are no stock options or stock appreciation rights outstanding as of August31, 2013. The Company currently grants restricted shares and restricted stock units. Restricted share grants
are considered outstanding shares of common stock at the time they are issued. The holders of unvested restricted shares are entitled to voting rights and participation in dividends. The dividends are not forfeitable if the awards are later
forfeited prior to vesting. The Company began granting restricted stock units during the year ended August31, 2013. Shares associated with restricted stock unit awards are not considered legally outstanding shares of common stock until
vesting. Restricted stock unit awards, including performance based awards, are entitled to participate in dividends and these awards are considered participating securities and are considered outstanding for earnings per share purposes when the
effect is dilutive. In January 2013, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 2010 Amended and Restated Stock Incentive
Plan to increase the total number of shares reserved for issuance by 1,500,000 shares. As a result, the maximum aggregate number of the Companys common shares authorized for issuance is 4,325,000. On August31, 2013 there were 1,384,997
shares available for grant compared to 259,650 and 720,047 shares available for grant as of the years ended August31, 2012 and 2011. During the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company awarded restricted share and restricted stock unit grants totaling 387,986, 466,680 and 309,380 shares which include performance
based grants. As of August31, 2013, there were a total of 516,495 shares associated with unvested performance based grants. The actual number of shares that will vest associated with performance based grants will vary depending on the
Companys performance. Approximately 535,945 additional shares may be granted if performance based

restricted share and restricted stock unit awards vest at stretch levels of performance. These additional shares are associated with restricted share and restricted stock unit awards granted
during the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The fair value of awards granted was $92 million, $95 million and $72 million for the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 
The value, at the date of grant, of stock awarded under restricted share grants and restricted stock unit grants are amortized as
compensation expense over the lesser of the vesting period of one to five years or to the recipients eligible retirement date. Compensation expense recognized related to restricted share grants and restricted stock unit grants for the years ended
August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $63 million, $88 million and $71 million and was recorded in Selling and administrative on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Unamortized compensation cost related to restricted stock grants was
$125 million as of August31, 2013. The unvested restricted share and restricted stock unit grants were 913,918 and
903,554 as of August31, 2013 and 2012.

Restricted stock grants and restricted stock units, including some grants
subject to certain performance criteria, are included in weighted average basic common shares outstanding when the Company is in a net earnings position. Weighted average basic common shares outstanding exclude 09million shares of unvested
restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended August31, 2013 as they are anti-dilutive due to a net loss. No restricted stock or warrants were anti-dilutive for the years ended August31, 2012 and 2011. 2
The dilutive effect of common stock equivalents is excluded from the share calculations for the year ended August31, 2013 due to a net loss. 3
In 2012, the dilutive effect of the 2018 Convertible notes are included
as they were considered dilutive under the if converted method. In 2011, the dilutive effect of the 2018 Convertible Notes was excluded from the share calculation as it was the less dilutive of the two approaches further discussed below.
The dilutive effect of the 2026 Convertible notes was excluded from the share calculations as the stock price for each year presented was less than the initial conversion price of $4805 and therefore considered anti-dilutive.
Dilutive EPS for the years ended August31, 2012 and 2011 was calculated using the more dilutive of
two approaches. The first approach includes the dilutive effect of outstanding warrants and shares underlying the 2026 Convertible notes in the share count using the treasury stock method. The second approach supplements the first by including the
if converted effect of the 2018 Convertible notes issued in March 2011. Under the if converted method debt issuance and interest costs, both net of tax, associated with the convertible notes are added back to net earnings and
the share count is increased by the shares underlying the convertible notes. The 2026 Convertible notes would only be included in the calculation of both approaches if the current stock price is greater than the initial conversion price of $4805
using the treasury stock method.

contract placement fee is accounted for under the equity method and is recorded in Intangibles and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result of losses experienced by WLR-GBX the carrying value of the investment is zero as of
August31, 2013. The Company also leases approximately 400 railcars from the WLR-GBX lease fleet. The Company has paid $32 million, $31 million and $28 million in lease expense for the years ended August31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively and has future lease commitments totaling $61 million. In March 2012, the Company purchased a 1% interest in
three trusts the Trusts. The company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company sold a total of $385 million and $611million to the Trusts for the years ended August31, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. See Note 26 Variable Interest Entities for additional information. In May 2013, the Company purchased an
8% interest in an entity that owns a portfolio of railcar assets that is leases to third parties. The company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company sold a total of $232 million to this entity for the year
ended August31, 2013. See Note 26 Variable Interest Entities for additional information. William Furman,
Director, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, also serves as director of Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Schnitzer. In the normal course of business, the Company sells scrap metal to Schnitzer. During the years ended

Mr.Furman is the owner of private aircraft managed by a private independent management company. From time to time, the Companys business requires charter use of privately-owned aircraft. In
such instances, it is possible that charters may be placed with the company that manages Mr.Furmans aircraft. The Company placed charters with the company that manages Mr.Furmans aircraft aggregating $02 million for each of
the years ended August31, 2013 and 2012 and $10 thousand for the year ended August31, 2011.

that will begin to expire in 2015, $13 million of state credit carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2017, and $66million of foreign NOL carryforwards that will begin to expire in 2014. The Company uses tax law ordering for purposes of
determining when excess tax benefits have been realized. During the current year the Company recognized excess tax benefits
of $03 million from the vesting of restricted stock awards. In addition, previously unrecognized NOL carryforwards created by excess tax benefits of $17million reduced taxes payable in the current year. The utilization of these carryforwards
resulted in an increase to stockholders equity of $06 million. 
The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report 59 Table of Contents
The net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended August31, 2013 was
approximately $45 thousand. The increase in the valuation allowance is primarily due to the increase in state tax credits for which no benefit is provided. No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes on approximately $318 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as the Company plans to reinvest these earnings
indefinitely in operations outside the U.S. Generally, such amounts become subject to U.S. taxation upon the remittance of dividends and under certain other circumstances. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability
related to investments in foreign subsidiaries. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits for the years presented:  In thousands

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is
no longer subject to U.S. Federal examination for tax years before 2010, to state and local examinations before 2008, or to foreign examinations before 2007. Unrecognized tax benefits at August31, 2013 were $11 million of which $07 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits at August31, 2012 were
$27 million. Accrued interest on reserves for uncertain tax positions as of August31, 2013 and 2012 were $02 million and $10 million, respectively. The Company recorded an interest benefit of $08 million for changes in the reserves during
the year ended August31, 2013 and interest expense of $01 million for changes during the year ended August31, 2012. The Company had not accrued any penalties on the reserves. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are not
classified as a component of income tax expense. Benefits from the realization of unrecognized tax benefits for deductible differences attributable to ordinary operations will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. The Company does not
anticipate a significant decrease in the reserves for uncertain tax positions during the next twelve months. 
Note 20 - Segment Information 
Greenbrier operates in three reportable segments: Manufacturing; Wheels, Repair Parts; and
Leasing Services. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Performance is evaluated based on margin. The Companys integrated business model results in
selling and administrative costs being intertwined among the segments. Currently, Greenbriers management does not allocate these costs for either external or internal reporting purposes. Intersegment sales and transfers are valued as if the
sales or transfers were to third parties. Related revenue and margin is eliminated in consolidation and therefore are not included in consolidated results in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Companys Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. The Company
has entered into a Voluntary Cleanup Agreement with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality DEQ in which the Company agreed to conduct an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present operations at the Portland
property may have released hazardous substances to the environment. The Company is also conducting groundwater remediation relating to a historical spill on the property which preceded its ownership. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA has classified portions of the river bed of the Portland Harbor, including the portion
fronting the Companys manufacturing facility, as a federal National Priority List or Superfund site due to sediment contamination the Portland Harbor Site. The Company and more than 140other parties
have received a General Notice of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised the Company that it may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation which liability may be joint
and several with other potentially responsible parties as well as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. At this time, ten private and public entities, including the Company the Lower
Willamette Group or LWG, have signed an Administrative Order on Consent AOC to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study RI/FS of the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several
additional entities have not signed such consent, but are nevertheless contributing money to the effort. The EPA-mandated RI/FS is being conducted by the LWG and has cost over $100million during a 13-year period. The Company has agreed to
initially bear a percentage of the total costs incurred by the LWG in connection with the investigation. The Companys aggregate expenditure has not been material during the 13-year period. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from
other responsible parties. The investigation is expected to continue for at least one more year. Eighty-three parties,
including the State of Oregon and the federal government, have entered into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs associated with the Portland Harbor site. Approximately 110 additional parties have signed tolling agreements
related to such allocations. On April23, 2009, the Company and the other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema Inc. et al v. A C Foundry Products, Inc.et al,
US District Court, District of Oregon, Case#3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice, and
the case has now been stayed by the court, pending completion of the RI/FS. Although, as described below, the draft feasibility study has been submitted, the RI/FS will not be complete until the EPA approves it, which is not likely to occur until at
least 2015. A draft of the remedial investigation study was submitted to the EPA on October27, 2009. The draft
feasibility study was submitted to the EPA on March30, 2012. The draft feasibility study evaluates several alternative cleanup approaches. The approaches submitted would take from 2 to 28 years with costs ranging from $169million to $18
billion for cleanup of the entire Portland Harbor Site, depending primarily on the selected remedial action levels. The draft feasibility study suggests costs ranging from $9 million to $163 million for cleanup of the area of the Willamette River
adjacent to the Companys Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility, depending primarily on the selected remedial action level. 
The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report 63 Table of Contents
The draft feasibility study does not address responsibility for the costs of clean-up or
allocate such costs among the potentially responsible parties, or define precise boundaries for the cleanup. Responsibility for funding and implementing the EPAs selected cleanup will be determined after the issuance of the Record of Decision.
Based on the investigation to date, the Company believes that it did not contribute in any material way to the damage of natural resources in the Portland Harbor Site and that the damage in the area of the Portland Harbor Site adjacent to its
property precedes its ownership of the Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility. Because these environmental investigations are still underway, sufficient information is currently not available to determine the Companys liability, if any, for
the cost of any required remediation of the Portland Harbor Site or to estimate a range of potential loss. Based on the results of the pending investigations and future assessments of natural resource damages, the Company may be required to incur
costs associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, the Company may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels
from its launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River, and the rivers classification as a Superfund site could result in some limitations on future dredging and launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect the
Companys business and Consolidated Financial Statements, or the value of its Portland property. We have also signed an
Order on Consent with DEQ to finalize the investigation of potential onsite sources of contamination that may have a release pathway to the Willamette River. Interim precautionary measures are also required in the order and those are in the process
of being completed. Our aggregate expenditure has not been material during the 13-year period. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. 
From time to time, Greenbrier is involved as a defendant in litigation in the ordinary course of business, the outcome of which cannot be
predicted with certainty. While the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be determined at this time, management believes that the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys Consolidated
Financial Statements. In accordance with customary business practices in Europe, the Company has $22 million in bank and
third party performance and warranty guarantee facilities, all of which have been utilized as of August31, 2013. To date no amounts have been drawn under these guarantee facilities. 
At August31, 2013, the Mexican joint venture had $504 million of third party debt outstanding, for which the Company has
guaranteed approximately $402 million. In addition, the Company, along with its joint venture partner, has committed to contributing $100 million to fund the capital expenditures to expand production capacity, of which the Company and its joint
venture partner will each contribute 50%. These amounts will be contributed at various intervals from May31, 2012 to October31, 2013. As of August31, 2013, the Company and the joint venture partner have each contributed $46
million. As of August31, 2013 the Company had outstanding letters of credit aggregating $68 million associated with
facility leases and workers compensation insurance.

Certain assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value, for
this disclosure, is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring a fair value as follows:  Level 1 observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments Level2 inputs, other than the quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments, which are observable, either directly or indirectly;
and
Level3 unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions.

March 2012 Agreement In March 2012, the Company purchased a 1% interest in three trusts the Trusts which are 99% owned by a third party. As of August31, 2013, the Company had completed the sale of 1,163
railcars to the Trusts for an aggregate value of $996 million. Gains and losses are allocated between the Company and the
third party equal to their respective ownership interest in the Trusts, with the exception that the Company may be entitled to receive a small portion of excess rent if the actual performance of the Trusts exceeds a target rate of return.
The Company contributed $69 million of cash collateral into restricted cash accounts to support the railcar portfolio
meeting a target minimum rate of return. If the actual return is less than the target return, the third party may withdraw amounts in the restricted cash accounts at certain intervals based on predetermined criteria. This obligation expires in March
2033. This $69 million, which is held in restricted cash, was recorded as a reduction in revenue on the sale of 1,020 new railcars and a reduction in gain on sale on the sale of the 143 used railcars with a credit to deferred revenue. 
In connection with this transaction, the Company entered into an agreement to provide administrative and remarketing services to the
Trusts. The agreement is currently set to expire in March 2033. The Company also entered into an agreement to provide maintenance services to the Trusts during the initial lease term of the railcars. The Company will receive management and
maintenance fees under each of the aforementioned agreements. The Company has evaluated this relationship under ASC 810-10
and has concluded that the Trusts qualify as variable interest entities and that the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company will not consolidate the Trusts and will account for the investments under the equity method of accounting.
As of August31, 2013, the carrying amount of the Companys investment in the Trust is $10 million which is
recorded in Intangibles and Other Assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. May 2013 Agreement 
In May 2013, the Company purchased an 8% interest in an entity that owns a portfolio of railcar assets that it leases to third parties
which is 92% owned by a third party. As of August31, 2013, the Company has sold 264railcars manufactured by the Company and subject to operating leases, for $232 million to this entity. 
Gains and losses will be allocated between the Company and the third party equal to their respective ownership interest in this entity.
In connection with this transaction, the Company entered into an agreement to provide administrative and remarketing services
to this entity and will earn a management fee for these services. The agreement is currently set to expire in May 2033. The
Company has evaluated this relationship under ASC 810-10 and has concluded that this entity qualifies as a variable interest entity and that the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company will not consolidate this entity and will account
for the investment under the equity method of accounting. The Company will eliminate 8% of the revenue and margin on railcars that were manufactured by the Company and sold to this entity. 
As of August31, 2013, the carrying amount of the Companys investment in this entity is $19 million which is recorded in
Intangibles and Other Assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In April 2010, WLRGreenbrier Rail Inc. WLR-GBX was formed and acquired a lease fleet of nearly 4,000 railcars
valued at approximately $2560 million. WLR-GBX is wholly owned by affiliates of WL Ross Co., LLC WL Ross. The Company paid a $61 million contract placement fee to WLR-GBX for the right to perform certain management and advisory
services and in exchange will receive management and other fee income and incentive compensation tied to the performance of WLR-GBX. The contract placement fee is accounted for under the equity method and was recorded in Intangibles and other assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recorded its share of losses of $21 million and $25 million for the years ended August31, 2012 and 2011 against the investment, reducing the investment balance to zero in 2012. While the Company
acts as asset manager to WLR-GBX, it is not the primary beneficiary. The Company has no authority to make decisions regarding key business activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance, such as asset re-marketing
and disposition activities, which requires the approval of affiliates of WL Ross.  As of August31 In thousands

In October 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million of the Companys
common stock. Under the share buyback program, shares of common stock may be purchased on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time-to-time. The timing and amount of purchases will be based upon market conditions,
securities law limitations and other factors. The share buyback program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares in any period.The share buyback program expires April30, 2015, but may be modified, suspended
or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company operates two manufacturing facilities in Sahagun,
Mexico, one of which the Company owns and one which is leased. In September 2013, the Company was notified by the landlord of its leased facility that the landlord does not intend to renew the lease following the expiration of the lease term in
November 2014. While the Company continues to discuss the potential extension of the lease, the Company is also planning for alternatives to replace the manufacturing capacity of such facility, including potentially through expanding production
capacity at the Companys owned facility in Sahagun, Mexico or at other manufacturing sites.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of
our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to Rule 13a-15b under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is 1recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and 2accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in
Internal Controls There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended August31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries the Company, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As of the end of the Companys 2013 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Companys internal control
over financial reporting as of August31, 2013 is effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG
LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their attestation report, which is included at the end of Part II, Item9A of this Form 10-K. 
The Greenbrier Companies 2013 Annual Report 83 Table of Contents
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
The Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion
of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. We have audited The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.
and subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August31, 2013 based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income loss, equity and cash flows for the three years ended August31, 2013, and our report dated October31, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
