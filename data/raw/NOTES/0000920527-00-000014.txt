To PSS World Medical, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PSS World
Medical, Inc. a Florida corporation and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and
April 2, 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31,
2000. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of PSS World Medical, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and April 2, 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective April 3, 1999, the
Company changed certain of its accounting principles for revenue recognition as
a result of the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue
Recognition.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to the
consolidated financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with
the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2000, APRIL 2, 1999 AND APRIL 3, 1998
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Data, Unless Otherwise Noted 1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company and Nature of Business
Physician Sales & Service, Inc. was incorporated in 1983 in Jacksonville,
Florida. On March 26, 1998, the corporate name of Physician Sales & Service,
Inc. was changed to PSS World Medical, Inc. the Company or PSS.
The Company, through its Physician Sales & Service, Inc. division Physician
Supply Business is a distributor of medical  supplies,  equipment and
pharmaceuticals to primary care and other office-based physicians in the United
States. As of March 31, 2000, the Company operated 51 service centers
distributing to over 100,000 physician office sites in all 50 states.
In November 1996, PSS established a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Diagnostic
Imaging, Inc. DI or Imaging Business. DI is a distributor of medical
diagnostic imaging supplies, chemicals, equipment, and service to the acute and
alternate care markets in the United States. As of March 31, 2000, DI operated
34 imaging division service centers distributing to approximately 45,000
customer sites in 42 states.
In March 1996, PSS established two new wholly-owned subsidiaries, WorldMed
International, Inc. WorldMed Int'l and WorldMed, Inc. These subsidiaries
were established to manage and develop PSS' European medical equipment and
supply distribution market. As of March 31, 2000, the European operation
included two service centers distributing to acute and alternate care sites in
Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg.
In March 1998, the Company  entered the long-term care market for the
distribution of medical supplies and other products with its acquisition of Gulf
South Medical Supply, Inc. Gulf South or Long-Term Care Business. As of
March 31, 2000, Gulf South, a wholly owned subsidiary of PSS, operated 14
long-term care distribution service centers serving over 14,000 long-term care
accounts in all 50 states.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries using the year-ends  discussed below. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Results of
operations of companies acquired in purchase business transactions are included
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the dates of
acquisition.
Fiscal Year
The Company fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to March 31 of each year.
Prior to April 4, 1998, Gulf South which was acquired in a business
combination accounted for as a pooling-of-interest, refer to Note 2, Business
Acquisitions year-end was December 31. The fiscal 1998 consolidated financial
statements combine the December 31, 1997 financial statements of Gulf South with
the April 3, 1998 financial statements of PSS. Effective April 4, 1998, Gulf
South fiscal year-end was changed to conform to the Company year-end. As
such, Gulf South results of operations for the period January 1, 1998 to April
3, 1998 are not included in any of the periods presented in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. Accordingly,  Gulf South results of
operations for the three months ended April 3, 1998 are reflected as an
adjustment to shareholders' equity of the Company as of April 4, 1998. The
Company fiscal 1999 consolidated financial statements include the combined
results of operations for the period from April 4, 1998 to April 2, 1999, of
both PSS and Gulf South.
F-7 Fiscal years 2000, 1999, and 1998 consist of 52, 52, and 53 weeks, respectively.
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, including cash and
cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term trade receivables, and
accounts payable approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of
these assets and liabilities. The fair value of the senior subordinated debt is
estimated using quoted market prices. The carrying value of the Company senior
subordinated debt at March 31, 2000 and April 2, 1999 was $125,000 and the
market value was $114,675 and $120,925, respectively. The carrying value of the
Company other long-term debt was $134,233 and $28,504, at March 31, 2000 and
April 2, 1999, respectively, which approximates fair value.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash held at banks, short-term
government obligations, commercial paper, and money market instruments. The
Company invests its excess cash in high-grade investments and, therefore, bears
minimal risk. These instruments have original maturity dates not exceeding three
months.
Marketable Securities
The Company  holds  investments  classified  as trading  securities  and
available-for-sale securities. Trading securities are reported at fair value,
with  unrealized  holding  gains or losses  reported in  earnings,  and
available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses excluded from earnings but reported in other comprehensive income,
net of the effect of income taxes, until sold. At the time of sale, any gains or
losses are recognized as a component of operating results. Gains and losses are
based on the specific identification method of determining cost.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company trade accounts receivables are exposed to credit risk. Although
the majority of the market served by the Company is comprised of numerous
individual accounts, none of which is individually significant to the Company.
The Company Gulf South subsidiary depends on a limited number of large
customers, and Gulf South customers have been experiencing significant
financial difficulty since the advent of the Prospective Payment System PPS
and their difficulties  worsened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.
Approximately 34% and 38% of Gulf South revenues for the years ended March 31,
2000 and April 2, 1999, respectively, represented sales to its top five
customers. Receivables for these five customers represented 316% of Gulf
South gross accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2000, before reserves,
and 340% of Gulf South net accounts receivable, after reserves. The Company
monitors the creditworthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis and provides
reserves for estimated bad debt losses and sales returns.
The Company had allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $10,839 and
$6,918 as of March 31, 2000 and April 2, 1999, respectively, of which $7,524 and
$3,552, respectively, related to Gulf South. Provisions for doubtful accounts
were approximately $15,812, $5,181, and $5,707, for fiscal years ended 2000,
1999, and 1998,  respectively,  of which $11,193,  $2,485,  and $4,422,
respectively, related to Gulf South.
Inventories
Inventories are comprised principally of medical and related products and are
stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market. Market is defined
as net realizable value. A companywide physical inventory observation is
performed semiannually. Any inventory that is impaired for any reason is
disposed of or written down to fair market value at this time. Management
reviews all branch inventory valuations and makes further adjustment if
necessary.
F-8 Slow moving inventory is tracked using a report that details items that have not
moved in the last 60, 90, or 120 days and an appropriate reserve is established.
Once slow moving inventory has been identified, the branches transfer inventory
to other branches with a market for that inventory. If management determines the
inventory is not saleable, the inventory is written off against the inventory
obsolescence reserve.
The Company allows the customers to return products under its no hassle
customer guarantee, and customers are issued credit memos. The Company records
an allowance for estimated sales returns and allowances at the end of each
period. Sales returns and allowances are estimated based on past history.
Property and Equipment
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to 30 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lease terms or the estimated useful lives,
whichever is shorter. Gain or loss upon retirement or disposal of property and
equipment is recorded in other income in the accompanying  consolidated
statements of income.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale
by measuring the carrying  amount of the assets  against the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows. At the time such evaluations indicate that the
future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient
to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their
fair values.
The DI division began implementing the JD Edwards OneWorld ERP System the JDE
Project in fiscal 1998 and is nearly complete as of March 31, 2000. During
fiscal 1999, the Company began implementing the JDE Project at the PSS and GSMS
divisions.  The Company  capitalizes the following costs associated with
developing  internal-use computer software: i external direct costs of
materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use computer
software; ii payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly
associated with and who devote time to the JDE Project, to the extent of the
time spent directly on the project; and iii interest costs incurred while
developing internal-use computer software.
Intangibles
Noncompete agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of
the agreements, which range from 3 to 15 years. The Company has classified as
goodwill the cost in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets
purchased in business  acquisitions  that are accounted for as purchase
transactions. Goodwill is being amortized over 15 to 30 years using the
straight-line method.
The Company periodically evaluates intangible assets to determine if there is
impairment. Based on these evaluations, there was an adjustment to the carrying
value of certain intangible assets in fiscal year 1998 refer to Note 4, Charges
Included in General and Administrative Expenses.
Self-Insurance Coverage
The Company has a self-funded program for employee & dependent health coverage.
This program includes an administrator, a large provider network and stop loss
reinsurance to cover individual claims in excess of $150 up to $2,000 per person
as well as receiving coverage on an aggregate basis. Claims that have been
incurred but not reported are recorded based on estimates of claims provided by
the third party administrator and are included in the accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Contingent Loss Accruals
In determining the accrual necessary for probable loss contingencies as defined
by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies, the Company includes estimates for professional fees, such as
engineering, legal, accounting, and consulting, and other related costs to be
incurred, unless such fees and related costs are not probable of being incurred
or are not reasonably estimable.
F-9 Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes.
Deferred income taxes result primarily from the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Shareholders' Equity
The Company realizes an income tax benefit from the exercise or early
disposition of certain stock options. This benefit results in a decrease in
current income taxes payable and a direct increase in additional paid-in capital
refer to Note 10, Income Taxes.
Other Comprehensive Income
Cumulative other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income has been
separately  disclosed  in the  accompanying  consolidated  statements  of
shareholders' equity.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the sale of products and equipment with no installation and
training requirements, is recognized when products are shipped. Revenue from the
sale of equipment with installation and training requirements is recognized when
installation and training are complete. Revenue from service contracts are
recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
The Company earns incentive rebates from its vendors if certain performance
goals are achieved. Incentive rebate income is recognized in the accounting
period in which the Company meets the performance measure.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements for the Company subsidiaries outside the United States
are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates for assets and
liabilities and weighted average exchange rates for income and expenses. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the other comprehensive income
component of shareholders' equity.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. The Company adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In accordance with SFAS No. 123,
for footnote disclosure purposes only, the Company computes its earnings and
earnings per share on a pro forma basis as if the fair value method had been
applied.
Earnings Per Common Share
Basic and diluted earnings per common share are presented in accordance with
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per common share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of stock options
refer to Note 11, Earnings Per Share.
Statements of Cash Flows
The Company noncash investing and financing activities were as follows                    F-10                         2000     1999     1998

Change in Accounting Principle
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff SEC staff
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition SAB 101,
which provides additional guidance in applying generally accepted accounting
principles for revenue recognition in consolidated financial statements. Areas
of SAB 101 relevant to the Company include the timing of recognizing 1
contingent revenue and 2 revenue derived from equipment sales that involve
installation and training of the equipment occurring after shipment and transfer
of title.
The Company sells equipment which falls into three broad categories: 1
equipment with no installation or training requirements, such as plug-and-play
units, 2 equipment with basic installation requirements, and 3 equipment
with complex installation and training requirements, such as large x-ray
equipment. With the exception of type 1 equipment, most installations include
a training component. Prior to the implementation of SAB 101, the Company
revenue recognition policy for type 1 and type 2 equipment was to recognize
revenue at the time the customer took title of the product, generally at the
time of shipment. The Company previously considered the related installation and
training  requirements to be perfunctory,  as it had routinely met its
installation and training obligations shortly after the ship date. Prior to the
implementation of SAB 101, the Company revenue recognition policy for type 3
equipment was to recognize revenue at the date installation was complete, but
prior to the completion of training, as the Company considered the related
training to be perfunctory.
The Company interpretation of the requirements of SAB 101 results in changes
to the Company accounting policies for revenue recognition for equipment since
the installation and training requirements are no longer considered perfunctory
based on the customer perspective. Revenue will be recognized for type 1
equipment sales on the date of shipment. Revenue will be recognized for type 2
and 3 equipment after the completion of installation and training.
The Company pre- and post- SAB 101 equipment sales recognition policies are
illustrated below        Point at which Company recognizes sale of equipment, by type
Type 1      Type 2       Type 3
Pre SAB 101   When shipped    When shipped   After completion of
installation
Under SAB 101  When shipped   After completion  After completion of
of installation   installation and
and training    training
The Company also participates in a variety of incentive rebate programs with its
vendors in which the Company receives rebates once certain volume thresholds
have been met. Prior to the adoption of SAB 101, the Company incentive rebate
recognition policy was to accrue for the estimated amount of rebate income
earned during the period, using current financial information, historical
experience, and projected results of the specific rebate program. Under SAB 101,
no rebate income will be recognized until the period in which the performance
measures are achieved.
F-11 As permitted, the Company has decided to early adopt SAB 101 for the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2000. The Company has changed its method of accounting for
equipment sales and contingent rebate income effective April 3, 1999. The
cumulative effect of this accounting change reduced net income for the year
ended March 31, 2000 by $14 million $24 pre-tax. The cumulative after tax
effect on both the basic and diluted earnings per share was a reduction of
$002. The effect of SAB 101, before the cumulative effect, did not have a
material impact on fiscal 2000, and would not have been material to fiscal 1999
or 1998. The quarterly information for fiscal 2000, presented in Note 17, have
been presented as if the Company adopted SAB 101 with a cumulative catch up
effective April 3, 1999.
Pending Recent Accounting Pronouncement
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In June
1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement 133, which
delays the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2000. The Company plans to adopt the provisions of this statement in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2002. The Company expects the impact of adopting
SFAS No. 133 will be immaterial.
2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS
On March 26, 1998, the Company completed its merger with Gulf South. The Company
issued 28,810,747 shares of its common stock for all of the outstanding common
stock of Gulf South, which was valued at $6626 million at the time of merger.
Each share of Gulf South common stock was exchanged for 175 shares of PSS
common stock. In addition, outstanding Gulf South stock options were converted
at the same exchange factor into stock options to purchase 2,206,461 shares of
PSS common stock. This merger constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests.
On September 23, 1997, the Company acquired S in a merger pursuant to which
the Company issued 1,737,458 shares of common stock to the former shareholders
of S in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of S
valued at $260 million at the time of the merger. The merger constituted a
tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.
Other Pooled Entities
The Company merged with certain other medical supply and equipment distributors
and imaging supply and equipment distributors in stock mergers accounted for
under the pooling-of-interests method of accounting. Due to the aggregate impact
of these individually immaterial pooling-of-interest  transactions on the
Company prior period financial statements,  the consolidated  financial
statements have been retroactively restated to include the pooling-of-interest
transactions as if the companies had operated as one entity since inception, as
shown below. The number of companies acquired and the number of shares of common
stock issued are as follows                          1999       1998

During fiscal 2000, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of 6 medical supply and equipment distributors, 12 imaging supply
and equipment distributors, and 2 long-term health care distributors. In
addition, the Company acquired the common stock of 4 imaging supply and
equipment distributors. A summary of the details of the transactions follow                            Fiscal Year

the beginning of the year in which the acquisition was made, and assuming
the acquisitions were made at the beginning of the immediately preceding year,
is included below. The unaudited pro forma selected financial data does not
purport to represent what the Company results of operation would actually have
been had the transactions in fact occurred as of an earlier date or project the
results for any future date or period.

Earnings per share:

$031     $069     $027 These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting,
and accordingly, the assets of the acquired companies have been recorded at
their estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions. The value of the
common stock issued in connection with these purchases is generally determined
based on an average market price of the shares over a ten-day period before a
definitive agreement is signed and the proposed transaction is announced. The
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and is amortized over
15 to 30 years.
F-13 The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the preliminary
allocation of the purchase price of the purchase acquisitions consummated in
fiscal 2000. The allocation of the purchase price, performed using values and
estimates available as of the date of the financial statements, has not been
finalized due to certain pre-acquisition contingencies identified by the Company
and the nature of the estimates required in the establishment of the Company
merger integration  plans.  Accordingly,  goodwill  associated with these
acquisitions may increase or decrease in fiscal 2001.
Merger costs and expenses
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded approximately $595 and $545,
respectively, of merger integration costs and expenses directly to goodwill as
incurred as these costs were contemplated at the time of acquisition. In
addition, during these fiscal years, the Company recorded approximately $489 and
$493, respectively, of merger costs and expenses related to other acquisitions
directly to goodwill for costs that were in excess of the original integration
plan accrual estimated by management. Such merger costs and expenses are
recorded directly to goodwill only if it is within one year from the date of the
acquisition and such expenses were contemplated at the time of the acquisition.
If merger costs and expenses are incurred subsequent to one year from the date
of the acquisition, or were not contemplated at the time of the acquisition,
such expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
Reversal of excess accrued merger costs and expenses
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company reversed approximately $767 and $1,343,
respectively, of certain accrued merger costs and expenses that management
determined to be unnecessary due to changes in integration plans or estimates.
Management evaluates integration plans at each period end and determines if
revisions to the accruals are appropriate. Such revisions to the original
estimates are recorded directly to goodwill.
Deferred tax assets of acquired companies
During fiscal 1999, the Company reduced goodwill by $2,644, to reflect a true-up
of the deferred tax assets and liabilities per the financial statements and the
tax return, as a result of additional information received on the deductibility
of certain pre-acquisition expenditures.
As a result of the above adjustments goodwill was increased by $317 during
fiscal 2000 and reduced by $2,949 during fiscal 1999, excluding the original
set-up of the plan. There were no such adjustments in fiscal 1998.
In addition, the terms of certain of the Company recent acquisition agreements
provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired entity results
of operations exceed certain targeted levels. Targeted levels are generally set
above the historical experience of the acquired entity at the time of
acquisition. Such additional consideration is to be paid in cash or with shares
of the Company common stock and is recorded when earned as additional purchase
price. The maximum amount of remaining contingent consideration is approximately
$135 million payable through fiscal 2001 and no earn-out payments have been
made prior to March 31, 2000.
3. GULF SOUTH'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 3, 1998
As discussed in Note 1, Background and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies, due to the Company consolidation method and the differing year-ends
of PSS and Gulf South, Gulf South results of operations for the three months
ended April 3, 1998 are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income for any periods presented. Rather, the results of
operations have been recorded as an adjustment to shareholders' equity during
the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Therefore, the results of Gulf South
operations for the period January 1, 1998 to April 3, 1998 are summarized below
for additional disclosure.                    F-14                                 Three Months

During the three months ended April 3, 1998, Gulf South recorded $24,825 of
charges  related to the  disposition of reconciling  items,  merger and
restructuring costs and expenses,  goodwill impairment charge, and other
operating charges. These charges are included in cost of goods sold and general
and administrative expenses above. The following table summarizes the components
of the $24,825 in charges.                                   Three Months

Cost of Goods Sold Reconciling Items
During the quarter ending April 3, 1998, a $56 million charge was recorded in
general and administrative expenses. Through a review of accounting records,
management believes this charge is appropriately related to cost of goods sold.
Increase Allowance for Obsolete Inventory
The charge relates directly to a change of plans, uses, and disposition efforts
which new Gulf South management had as compared to prior management. This
decision to significantly alter Gulf South inventory retention and buying
policies, and, therefore, to dispose of the related inventories, resulted in a
change in the ultimate valuation of the impacted inventories. This charge was
recognized in the period in which management made the decision to dispose of the
affected inventory, which was Gulf South quarter ended April 3, 1998.
General and Administrative Expenses Direct Transaction Costs Related to the Merger
Direct transaction costs primarily consist of professional fees, such as
investment banking, legal, and accounting, for services rendered through the
date of the merger. As of April 2, 1999, all direct transaction costs were paid.
Due to subsequent negotiations and agreements between the Company and its
service provider, actual costs paid were less than costs originally billed and
recorded. As a result, approximately $777 of costs were reversed against general
and administrative expenses during the quarter ended September 30, 1998.
F-15 Restructuring Costs and Expenses
In order to improve customer service, reduce costs, and improve productivity and
asset utilization, the Company decided to realign and consolidate its operations
with Gulf South. The restructuring costs and expenses, which directly relate to
the merger with PSS, were recorded during the three months ended April 3, 1998.
During this time period, management approved and committed to a plan to
integrate and restructure the business of Gulf South.
The Company recorded restructuring costs and expenses for costs for lease
terminations, severance and benefits to terminate employees, facility closure,
and other costs to complete the consolidation of the operations. The following
table summarizes the components of the restructuring charge.
Involuntary employee termination    $ 1,879
Lease termination      977
Branch shutdown      885
Other exit      540
$ 4,281
Refer to Note 5, Accrued Merger and Restructuring Costs and Expenses, and Note
17, Quarterly Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion regarding
accrued restructuring costs and expenses.
Legal Fees and Settlements
Gulf South recorded a $2,000 accrual for legal fees specifically related to
class action lawsuits, which Gulf South, the Company, and certain present and
former directors and officers were named as defendants. These lawsuits are
further discussed in Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies. In addition, Gulf
South recorded $700 in charges related to a customer supply agreement.
Operational Tax Charge
Gulf South recorded an operational tax charge of $9,492, of which $2,772 was
recorded in the quarter ended April 3, 1998, for state and local, sales and use,
and property taxes that are normally charged directly to the customer at no cost
to the Company. Penalties and interest are included in the above charge as Gulf
South did not timely remit payments to tax authorities. The Company reviewed all
available information, including tax exemption notices received, and recorded
charges to expense during the period in which the tax noncompliance issues
arose. See Note 4, Charges Included in General and Administrative Expenses, for
a more detailed discussion related to this issue.
Goodwill Impairment Charge
The $1,664 goodwill impairment charge relates primarily to a prior Gulf South
acquisition. During the quarter ended April 3, 1998, a dispute with the acquired
company prior owners and management resulted in the loss of key employees and
all operational information related to the acquired customer base. This
ultimately affected Gulf South ability to conduct business related to this
acquisition, and impacted Gulf South ability to recover the value assigned to
the goodwill asset.
4.  CHARGES INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
In addition to typical general and administrative expenses, this line includes
charges related to merger activity, restructuring activity, and other special
items. The following table  summarizes  charges included in general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income                    F-16                                        2000     1999     1998

Merger Costs and Expenses
The Company policy is to accrue merger costs and expenses at the commitment
date of an integration plan if certain criteria under EITF 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity EITF 94-3 or 95-14, Recognition of Liabilities in Anticipation of a
Business Combination EITF 95-14, are met. Merger costs and expenses recorded
at the commitment date primarily include charges for direct transaction costs,
involuntary  employee  termination  costs,  branch shut-down costs, lease
termination costs, and other exit costs.
If the criteria described in EITF 94-3 or EITF 95-14 are not met, the Company
records merger costs and expenses as incurred. Merger costs expensed as incurred
include the following: 1 costs to pack and move inventory from one facility to
another or within a facility in a consolidation of facilities, 2 relocation
costs paid to employees in relation to an acquisition accounted for under the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting, 3 systems or training costs to
convert the acquired companies to the current existing information system, and
4 training costs related to conforming the acquired companies operational
policies to that of the Company operational policies. In addition, amounts
incurred in excess of the original amount accrued at the commitment date are
expensed as incurred.
Merger costs and expenses for fiscal 2000 include $2,300 of charges for merger
costs expensed as incurred. In addition, during fiscal 2000, the Company
reversed approximately $1,602 of merger costs and expenses into income, of which
$1,437 related to accrued lease termination costs.
Effective February 1, 2000, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the PSS
World Medical, Inc. Officer Retention Bonus Plan and the PSS World Medical, Inc.
Corporate Office Employee Retention Bonus Plan collectively the Retention
Plans. As part of the Company strategic alternatives process see Note 20,
Subsequent Event, management put these plans in place to retain certain
officers and key employees during the transition period. The total costs related
to these plans is approximately $10,110 of which $1,002, $4,805, $2,872, and
$1,431 will be expensed in fiscal 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively.
Merger costs and expenses for fiscal 1999 include $2,818 of charges recorded at
the commitment date of an integration plan adopted by management and $2,481 of
charges for merger costs expensed as incurred. In addition, during fiscal 1999,
the Company reversed approximately $928 of merger costs and expenses into
income, of which approximately $777 related to direct transaction costs refer
to Note 3, Gulf South Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended April
3, 1998.
Merger costs and expenses for fiscal 1998 include $4,055 of charges recorded at
the commitment date of an integration plan adopted by management and $10,011 of
charges for merger costs expensed as incurred. The merger costs expensed as
incurred primarily relate to direct transaction costs related to the merger with
Gulf South.
Restructuring Costs and Expenses
Fiscal 2000 activity
During the quarter ended September 30, 1999, management approved and adopted a
formal plan to restructure certain operations of Gulf South Plan C, an
additional component to the previously established Plans A and B. This
restructuring plan identified five additional distribution centers and the Gulf
South corporate facility as redundant or inadequate for future operations. As a
result, these locations were closed and made permanently idle. Accordingly, the
Company recorded restructuring costs and expenses of $4,967 at the commitment
date of the restructuring plan adopted by management. Such costs include branch
shutdown costs, lease termination costs, involuntary employee termination costs
of $494, $2,915, and $1,558, respectively. Refer to Note 5, Accrued Merger and
Restructuring Costs and Expenses,  for further discussion  regarding the
restructuring plan.
F-17 Restructuring costs and expenses for the twelve months ended March 31, 2000 also
included $9,213 of charges that were expensed as incurred and primarily relate
to other exit costs. Other exit costs include costs to pack and move inventory,
costs to set up new facilities, employee relocation costs, and other related
facility  closure costs.  In addition,  the company  reversed $1,341 of
restructuring costs into income, which related to over-accrual for lease
termination costs, and involuntary employee termination costs.
During the three months ended March 31, 2000, management approved and adopted a
formal plan to restructure the Imaging Business' sales and service organization
and the shut down of two facilities Plan D. Accordingly, the Company
recorded restructuring costs and expenses of $318 at the commitment date of the
restructuring plan adopted by management. Refer to Note 5, Accrued Merger and
Restructuring Costs and Expenses,  for further discussion  regarding the
restructuring plan. Restructuring costs and expenses for the three months ended
March 31, 2000 also included $88 of charges that were expensed as incurred and
primarily relate to other exit costs. Other exit costs include costs to pack and
move inventory, costs to set up new facilities, employee relocation costs, and
other related facility closure costs.
Fiscal 1999 activity
During the quarter ended June 30, 1998, management approved and adopted Plan B,
an additional Gulf South component to the 1998 restructuring plan or Plan A.
This restructuring plan identified two additional distribution centers and two
corporate offices to be merged with existing facilities and identified three
executives to be involuntarily terminated. Accordingly, the Company recorded
restructuring costs and expenses of $1,503 at the commitment date of the
restructuring plan adopted by management. Such costs include branch shutdown
costs, lease termination costs, involuntary employee termination costs of $281 570, and $652, respectively.
The remaining $3,419 of restructuring costs recorded during fiscal 1999
represent charges expensed as incurred. Such costs include charges for training
costs related to conforming the acquired companies operational policies to that
of the Company operational policies, direct transaction costs, involuntary
employee termination costs, and other exit costs of $1,138, $227, $300, and
$1,754, respectively. Other exit costs include costs to pack and move inventory,
costs to set up new facilities, employee relocation costs, and other related
facility closure costs.
Fiscal 1998 activity
During fiscal 1998, due to the impact of the Gulf South merger, the Company
recorded restructuring costs and expenses of $3,691 related to the PSS and DI
divisions Plan A. See Note 3, Gulf South Results of Operations for the Three
Months Ended April 3, 1998, which discusses the charges recorded by the Gulf
South division. Refer to Note 5, Accrued Merger and Restructuring Costs and
Expenses, for a further discussion regarding the restructuring plan.
Information Systems Accelerated Depreciation
In connection with the Gulf South merger during fiscal 1998, management
evaluated the adequacy of the combined companies' information systems. The
Company concluded that its existing information systems were not compatible with
those of Gulf South and not adequate to support the future internal growth of
the combined companies and expected growth resulting from future acquisitions.
Pursuant to SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS No. 121, the Company evaluated
the recoverability of the information system assets. Based on the Company
analysis, impairment did not exist at the division level; therefore, management
reviewed the depreciation estimates in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB No. 20, Accounting Changes.
Effective April 4, 1998, the estimated useful lives of the PSS, DI, and GSMS
division information systems were revised to 12 to 15 months, which was the
original estimate of when the new systems implementation would be completed. The
$5,379 charge represents the incremental fiscal 1999 impact on depreciation
expense resulting from management decision to replace its information systems.
F-18 Goodwill Impairment Charges
During fiscal 2000, the Imaging Business closed their Metro New York facility.
The closure of this facility triggered an asset impairment as determined under
SFAS No. 121. As a result, goodwill of $517 was written off during fiscal 2000.
During fiscal 1998, the Company determined that goodwill related to three
foreign World Med Int'l acquired companies and one domestic PSS division
acquired company, was not recoverable. As such, the goodwill of $5,807 related
to the four entities was written-off during fiscal 1998.
Gulf South Operational Tax Charge and Professional Fee Accrual
The Company, in connection with the filing of its fiscal 1998 financial
statements, restated for certain operational tax compliance issues in the
financial statements of Gulf South for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996,
and 1995. As such, Gulf South recorded operational charges of $3,067, $1,998,
and $1,656 during fiscal 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively, primarily related
to state and local, sales and use, and property taxes that are normally charged
directly to the customer at no cost to the Company. In addition, as explained in
Note 3, Gulf South Results of Operations for Three Months Ended April 3, 1998 2,772 of such charges were recorded by Gulf South during the quarter ended
April 3, 1998. Interest is included in the above charges as Gulf South did not
timely remit payments to tax authorities. The Company reviewed all available
information, including tax exemption notices received, and recorded charges to
expense during the period in which the tax noncompliance issues arose. During
fiscal 2000, the Company performed an analysis of the estimated exposure based
on the most recent available information and reversed $1,221 of the previously
recorded operating tax charge reserve.
In addition, professional fees estimated to be incurred to resolve the tax
issues of $2,919 for fiscal 1998 were recorded in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income for the year ended April 3, 1998.
Other Charges
During fiscal 1999, the Company incurred approximately $1,010 of costs related
to acquisitions not consummated.
Other charges recorded in fiscal 1998 relate to the ESOP cost of an acquired
company. S sponsored a leveraged employee stock ownership plan S ESOP
that covered all employees with one year of service. The Company accounted for
this ESOP in accordance with SOP 93-6, Employers Accounting for Employee Stock
Ownership Plans. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP was recorded as debt of the
Company, and the shares pledged as collateral were reported as unearned ESOP
shares in the balance sheet. As shares were released from collateral, the
Company reported compensation expense equal to the then current market price of
the shares, and the shares became outstanding for the earnings-per-share EPS
computation. During fiscal 1998, the Company released the remaining shares to
the S ESOP participants. Accordingly, approximately $2,457 of related expenses
were recognized in fiscal 1998.
5. ACCRUED MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND EXPENSES
Summary of Accrued Merger Costs and Expenses
In connection with the consummation of business combinations, management often
develops formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily terminate
employees, and relocate employees of the acquired companies. Management plans
to exit an activity often include identification of duplicate facilities for
closure and  identification of facilities for  consolidation  into other
facilities.
Generally, completion of the integration plans will occur within one year from
the date in which the plans were formalized and adopted by management. However,
intervening events occurring prior to completion of the plan, such as subsequent
acquisitions or system conversion issues, can significantly impact a plan that
had been previously established. Such intervening events may cause modifications
to the plans and are accounted for on a prospective basis. At the end of each
quarter, management reevaluates its integration plans and adjusts previous
estimates.
F-19 As part of the integration plans, certain costs are recognized at the date in
which the plan is formalized and adopted by management commitment date. These
costs are generally related to employee terminations and relocation, lease
terminations, and branch shutdown. In addition, there are certain costs that do
not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date and are expensed as the
plan is implemented refer to Note 4, Charges Included in General and
Administrative Expenses. Involuntary employee termination costs are employee
severance costs and termination benefits. Lease termination costs are lease
cancellation fees and forfeited deposits. Branch shutdown costs include costs
related to facility closure costs. Employee relocation costs are moving costs of
employees of an acquired company in transactions accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting.
Accrued merger costs and expenses, classified as accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, were $1,089 and $4,084, at March 31,
2000 and April 2, 1999, respectively. The discussion and rollforward of the
accrued merger costs and expenses below  summarize the  significant and
nonsignificant integration plans adopted by management for business combinations
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and pooling-of-interests
method of accounting. Integration plans are considered to be significant if the
charge recorded to establish the accrual is in excess of 5% of consolidated
pretax income.
Significant Pooling-of-Interests Business Combination Plan
The Company formalized and adopted an integration plan in December 1997 to
integrate the operations of S with the Imaging Business. The following accrued
merger costs and expenses were recognized in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations at the commitment date. A summary of the merger
activity related to the S merger is as follows                             Involuntary

As of December 31, 1999, all of the employees have been terminated and all of
the seven identified distribution facilities had been shut down. During the
three months ended December 31, 1999, management determined that all costs
related to the merger plan had been incurred except for lease termination costs
for one location that will be paid through fiscal 2002. Therefore, an adjustment
of $413 was recorded to reverse the over-accrual of involuntary employee
termination costs and lease termination costs. Refer to Note 4, Charges Included
in General and Administrative Expenses.
Nonsignificant Poolings-of-Interests Business Combination Plans
The following accrued merger costs and expenses were recognized in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations at the date in which the
integration plan was formalized and adopted by management. A summary of the
merger activity related to eight nonsignificant pooling-of-interests business
combinations completed during fiscal 1998 through 2000, respectively, is as

F-20 The Imaging Business acquired Tristar Imaging Systems, Inc. in October 1998, and
management formalized and adopted an integration plan in late fiscal 1999 to
integrate the operations of the acquired company. Management determined that all
costs related to the merger plan had been incurred except for lease termination
costs of $545 for which payment will extend through fiscal 2007. Therefore an
adjustment of $1,189 was made to reverse the over accrual of certain costs
accrued for under the plan, the majority related to lease termination costs.
Significant Purchase Business Combination Plan
The Company formalized and adopted an integration plan in September 1997 to
integrate the operations of General X-Ray, Inc. GXI with the Imaging
Business. The following accrued merger costs and expenses were recognized and
additional goodwill was recorded at the commitment date. A summary of the GXI
merger accruals is as follows in thousands                             Involuntary

operations would be ceased due to duplicative functions. Relocation costs were
recorded related to the transfer of approximately 15 GXI employees. Involuntary
employee termination costs are costs for 19 employees, including severance and
benefits, who represent duplicative functions as service and operations leaders,
customer service representatives, and accounting personnel at locations where
facilities would be combined. As of April 2, 1999, all employees have been
terminated and relocated, and the plan has been completed.
Certain intervening events occurred that modified the execution of the GXI
integration plan. Due to growth from a subsequent acquisition and improvement in
the operating results for a distribution facility previously identified to be
closed, certain merger accruals were not utilized. Therefore, an adjustment was
recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 1999 to reverse $1,125 of excessive
accruals against goodwill.
Nonsignificant Purchase Business Combination Plans
The following accrued merger costs and expenses were recognized and additional
goodwill was recorded at the date in which the integration plans were formalized
and adopted by management. A summary of the merger activity related to six
nonsignificant purchase business combinations during fiscal 1998 through 2000 is

The Imaging Business acquired South Jersey X-Ray, Inc. in October 1998, and
management formalized and adopted an integration plan during the three months
ended June 30, 1999 to integrate the operations of the acquired company.
Approximately $328 of the $442 accrued merger costs and expenses at March 31,
2000 relate to this integration plan. As of December 31, 1999, all locations
have been shut down and all employees were terminated as a result of the plan.
However, lease termination payments will extend through fiscal 2004. The
remaining accrual of $114 relates to multiple merger plans that are immaterial.
During fiscal 2000, management determined that actual merger costs to be
incurred were less than management estimate recorded to establish the accrued
merger costs and expenses. Therefore, an adjustment to reduce goodwill of $674
was recorded to eliminate the excessive accruals.
Summary of Accrued Restructuring Costs and Expenses
Primarily as a result of the impact of the Gulf South merger, in order to
improve customer service, reduce costs, and improve productivity and asset
utilization, the Company decided to realign and consolidate its operations.
Accordingly, the Company began implementing a restructuring plan during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which impacted all divisions Plan A.
Subsequently, the Company adopted a second restructuring plan during the first
quarter of fiscal 1999 related to the Gulf South division Plan B to further
consolidate its operations.
The Company recorded a total accrual of $7,972 related to Plan A. Approximately
$3,691 of the $7,972 total restructuring charge was related to the PSS and DI
divisions and was recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations  for fiscal 1998.  The additions  from Gulf South  represent
restructuring costs and expenses of $4,281 recorded by Gulf South during the
unconsolidated period January 1 to April 3, 1998. No amounts were utilized
during this period. This charge is not included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations; rather it is included in the retained earnings
adjustment recorded on April 4, 1998. Refer to Note 1, Background and Summary of
Accounting Policies, for a discussion regarding the different year-ends of Gulf
South and the Company.
During fiscal 1999, the Company established an additional accrual of $1,503
related to Plan B. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2000, the
Company established accruals of $4,968 and $319 for Plan C and Plan D,
respectively.
Accrued restructuring costs and expenses, classified as accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, were $1,607 and $3,818 million, at
March 31, 2000 and April 2, 1999, respectively. A summary of the restructuring
plan activity is as follows                    F-22                        Involuntary

Plan A
As of December 31, 1999, all employees were terminated as a result of the plan
and the related severance payments were made in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2000. As of December 31, 1999, all of the locations were merged into existing
locations.
Plan B
As of December 31, 1999, all of the six locations had been shut down. As of
September 30, 1999, all employees were terminated as a result of the plan and
the related severance payments were made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000.
Plan C
During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, management evaluated the Company
overall cost structure and implemented cost reductions in order to meet internal
profitability  targets.  In addition,  management decided to improve its
distribution model and relocate the corporate office for the GSMS division to
Jacksonville, Florida where the corporate offices for the DI and PSS divisions
exist. The Company began implementing the restructuring plan during the second
quarter of fiscal 2000, which impacted all divisions Plan C. The total
number of employees to be terminated was 272. All employees have been terminated
at March 31, 2000. Accrued restructuring costs and expenses related to Plan C
were $1,208 at March 31, 2000, of which $668 relates to lease terminations, $166
to involuntary employee terminations, and $374 to branch shut down costs.
Plan D
During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Imaging Business' management made
a discretionary decision to change its business strategy and the way it operates
to improve future operations. These changes include restructuring the Imaging
Business sales force, terminating approximately 50 service engineers, and
closure of two distribution centers. The total number of employees to be
terminated are 87, of which 30 employees have been terminated at March 31, 2000.
Accrued restructuring costs and expenses related to this plan were $210 at March
31, 2000, all relating to involuntary employee terminations.
During fiscal 2000, management determined that all costs associated with
restructuring Plans A and B had been incurred with the exception of $189 of
lease termination costs. Therefore an adjustment of $1,692 was recorded to
reverse the over accrual of lease termination, involuntary employee termination,
and branch shutdown costs related to Plans A and B. Management also determined
that Plan C was over accrued and recorded an adjustment of $318 to reverse the
over accrual of lease termination and involuntary employee termination costs
related to Plan C. As of March 31, 2000, the Company had accrued $1,208 and $210
for restructuring Plans C and D, respectively.

Senior Subordinated Notes During October 1997, the Company issued 85% unsecured senior subordinated notes
due in 2007 the Notes in the amount of $1250 million. Interest on the Notes
accrues from the date of original issuance and is payable semi-annually on April
1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 1998, at a rate of 85% per
annum. The Notes are subject to certain covenants, including cross covenants
with the Company senior  revolving  credit  facility,  restrictions on
indebtedness, investments, payments of dividends, purchases of treasury stock,
and sales of assets and maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 to 10.
Senior Revolving Credit
The Company entered into a $1400 million senior revolving credit facility with
a syndicate of financial institutions with Bank of America, N.A. as principal
agent in February 1999. Borrowings under the credit facility are available for
working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions and are secured by the
common stock of the subsidiaries and assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The credit facility expires February 10, 2004 and borrowings bear interest at
variable rates, at the Company option, at either the lender base rate or the
LIBOR rate plus a variable spread based upon the Company leverage ratio. At
March 31, 2000, the weighted average interest rates under these borrowing
options were 925% and 73%, respectively. The amount available under the credit
facility at March 31, 2000 was $170 million, net of a $2 million stand-by
letter of credit.
On October 20, 1999, the Company amended its $1400 million senior revolving
credit facility to allow for repurchases of up to $500 million of the Company
common stock through October 31, 2000. In addition, the amendment modified the
consolidated net worth maintenance covenant to reduce the $3370 million minimum
compliance level by any repurchases made by the Company of its common stock.
F-25 The credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, the
most restrictive of which require maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio of 35
to 10, maintenance of consolidated net worth of $3370 million, and maintenance
of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 to 10. In addition, the
covenants limit additional indebtedness and asset dispositions, require majority
lender approval on acquisitions with a total purchase price greater than
$75,000, and restrict payments of dividends.
As of March 31, 2000, the Company was not in compliance with the following
covenants under the senior revolving credit facility: 1 consolidated fixed
charge coverage ratio, 2 consolidated leverage ratio, and 3 annual capital
expenditure limits. However, the Company obtained a waiver from these covenants
from the lending group for the period ended March 31, 2000. Management believes
it is probable that the Company will meet these covenants in future periods,
or that appropriate waivers will be obtained. As such, the related debt has been
classified as non-current as of March 31, 2000.
Capital Lease Obligations
As of March 31, 2000, future minimum payments, by fiscal year and in the
aggregate, required under capital leases are approximately as follows Fiscal Year:

Notes Payable to Owners of Acquired Companies Notes payable to owners of acquired companies consists of holdback agreements or
notes payable that are paid to the previous owners after certain contingencies
are met, such as collection of all acquired accounts receivable and the sale of
acquired inventory. These notes payable are due within one year of the
acquisition.
Other Notes
At March 31, 2000, other notes consist of various debt maintained by WorldMed
Int'l, including a working capital line of credit, a mortgage on facilities in
Leuven, Belgium, and debt to acquire certain international business service
centers. Interest rates on the related notes range from 49% to 62 respectively.

$471 to $1971 and the weighted-average  remaining contractual life of
outstanding options plan was 75 years.
F-32 The Company granted warrants for 787,500 shares of its common stock on January
2, 1997 at an exercise price of $1480 in connection with the purchase of
Gateway. All of the warrants were exercisable upon the date of grant and expire
January 2, 2002.
Unregistered Stock Options
During fiscal 1999, the Company issued approximately 255,000 unregistered stock
options to non-officer employees. During fiscal 2000, 90,000 of these options
were cancelled leaving 165,000 outstanding as of March 31, 2000. The exercise
price of options granted was $1300, which was equal to the fair market value of
the Company common stock on the date of grant.
Fair Value of Stock Options
Under SFAS No. 123, pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
options under the fair value method. The fair value of stock options granted has
been estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of PSS' stock options Broad-Based Employee Stock Plan, Incentive
Stock Option Plan,  Long-Term Stock Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan, and
Directors' Stock Plan granted during fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 have been
estimated based on the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free
interest rates ranging from 575% to 66%, expected option life ranging from 25
to 75 years; expected volatility of 600%, 560%, and 550%, respectively; and
no expected dividend yield. Using these assumptions, the estimated fair values
of options granted for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998 were approximately $2,842 9,091, and $4,814, respectively, and such amounts would be included in
compensation expense.
The fair value of Gulf South stock options granted during fiscal 1998 have
been estimated based on the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free
interest rates of 60%, expected option life of three years; expected volatility
of 652%, and no expected dividend yield. Using these assumptions, the estimated
fair values of options granted for fiscal 1998 were approximately $1,568, and
such amounts would be included in compensation expense.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have  characteristics  significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
Pro forma net income and net income per share for the fiscal years ended 2000,
1999, and 1998, assuming the Company had accounted for the plans under the fair
value approach, are as follows in thousands, except per share data                      2000     1999     1998
Net income:

Because the fair value method of accounting has not been applied to options
granted prior to March 31, 1996, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may
not be representative of that to be expected in future years.                    F-33 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan PSS ESOP available to
all employees with at least one year of service. Employees can invest their
contributions in various mutual funds as well as the common stock of the
Company. Employer contributions are invested in the common stock of the Company.
A company acquired in fiscal 1999 sponsored a leveraged employee stock ownership
plan Tristar ESOP. The Tristar ESOP was merged into the PSS ESOP effective
August 6, 1999 and the note payable to a third party was replaced with financing
from the holding company. As a result of the merger, the PSS ESOP became a
leveraged ESOP. In addition, subsequent to the merger, a supplemental matching
contribution is made to all employees who elect to have their salary deferrals
invested in the common stock of the Company. The supplemental match for fiscal
2000 was $234. The Company accounts for the PSS ESOP in accordance with SOP
93-6. Accordingly, the shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned
ESOP shares in the balance sheet. As shares are released from collateral, the
Company reports compensation expense equal to the then current market price of
the shares, and the shares become outstanding for the earnings-per-share EPS
computation.
The PSS ESOP owned approximately 1,606,000 and 2,123,000 shares of the Company
common stock at March 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Company contributions to
the plan, excluding the supplemental match, were approximately $1,417, $123, and
$134 for fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively, and are made at the
discretion of the Company.
The following presents the PSS ESOP share activity                                  2000       1999       1998

Approximately 29,600 shares of common stock are held in escrow. The escrow
shares will be settled in fiscal 2001. Approximately $690, $221, and $824, of
related expense was recognized in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
S sponsored a leveraged employee stock ownership plan S ESOP that
covered all employees with one year of service. The Company accounted for this
ESOP in accordance with SOP 93-6. Accordingly, the debt of the ESOP was recorded
as debt of the Company, and the shares pledged as collateral were reported as
unearned ESOP shares in the balance sheet. As shares were released from
collateral, the Company reported compensation expense equal to the then current
market price of the shares, and the shares became outstanding for the
earnings-per-share EPS computation.
The S ESOP shares were as follows                                 1998
Allocated shares       398,727

participants,  and it is management intention to terminate this plan.
Accordingly, approximately $25 million of related expense was recognized in
fiscal 1998.
The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan available to employees with
at least one year of service. The plan allows eligible employees to purchase
company stock  over-the-counter  through payroll  deductions.
F-34 PSS Deferred Compensation Program
The Company offers a deferred compensation program the Program to qualified
executives, management, and salespeople. The program, which is an unfunded plan,
includes a deferred compensation plan and a stock option program. The Company
has purchased life insurance as a means to finance the benefits that become
payable under the plan.
Under the deferred compensation plan, participants can elect to defer up to 100%
of their total compensation. The Company will make a matching contribution of up
to 10% to 15% of the participant deferral. The match contribution ranges from
25% to 125% of the participant deferral. Participants are guaranteed to earn
interest, their deferral amount and the Company match at a rate declared
annually by the Board of Directors 513% for the plan years ended March 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. The interest rate shall never be less than the
90-day U.S. Treasury Bill rate.
Under the stock option plan, participants are granted stock options to purchase
common stock of the Company. The number of stock options granted is a function
of the participant annual deferral amount plus the Company match. The grant
price of the option is determined annually to reflect an exercise price which
allows the annual deferral amount to be supplemented by the growth of the PSS
stock in excess of the declared interest rate projected to compound for four
years. Thus, the option price is not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date such option is granted.
Participant contributions are always 100% vested. The Company match and the
stock options vest as follows        # of Years in the plan          Vesting        Less than 4 years               0%

7 years                    80%
8 years                   100%
Death or disability             100 After the options are 100% vested, participants can exercise up to 25% of vested
options in any calendar year.
At age 60, or age 55 with 10 years of participation in the Program, the
retirement  benefit is distributed to participants in five equal annual
installments. The retirement benefit is distributed in a lump sum upon death and
over five years upon disability. In the event of termination of employment, 100%
of the participant  vested balance will be distributed in five equal
installments.
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company matched approximately $864 and $638,
respectively, of employee deferrals. At March 31, 2000 and April 2, 1999,
approximately $4,696 and $2,497, respectively, is recorded in other long-term
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, $5,561 and
$2,490, respectively, of deferred compensation is included in other long-term
liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
15. OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company leases various facilities and equipment under operating leases which
expire at various dates through 2009. Certain lease commitments provide that the
Company pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses related to the leased
assets.
Rent expense approximated $26,949, $19,905, and $19,019 for fiscal 2000, 1999,
and 1998, respectively. As of March 31, 2000, future minimum payments, by fiscal
year and in the aggregate, required under noncancelable operating leases are as

16. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information, which establishes the way public companies report
information about segments. SFAS No. 131 requires segment reporting in interim
periods and disclosures regarding products and services, geographic areas, and
major customers.
The Company reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer different
products and services to different segments of the health care industry, and are
based upon how management regularly evaluates the Company. These segments are
managed separately because of different customers and products. See Note 1,
Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for descriptive
information about the Company business segments. International business and
other follow the accounting policies of the segments described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. The Company primarily evaluates the operating
performance of its segments based on net sales and income from operations.

The following table presents  summarized  unaudited quarterly results of
operations for the Company for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. The Company believes
all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated below to
present fairly the following selected information when read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Future quarterly operating
results may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including the timing of
acquisitions of service centers, the timing of the opening of start-up service
centers, and changes in customer buying patterns of supplies, diagnostic
equipment and pharmaceuticals. Results of operations for any particular quarter
are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or any
other quarter.
The results of operations for quarter ended March 31, 2000 differ significantly
from the quarters ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 1999 primarily
as a result of the following. First, the long-term care business in general has
faced significant financial pressure due to PPS, resulting in bankruptcy
of certain long-term care providers. During the fourth quarter, several
of GSMS' largest customers resolved or disclosed their plans for
unsecured creditors, including the Company, at terms unfavorable to the
Company. As a result, GSMS has i recorded bad debt charges of approximately
$95 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2000, ii renegotiated
contracts with customers that decreased both sales prices and gross profit,
iii restructured facilities to more efficiently distribute products, and
iv renegotiated product costs with vendors to mitigate the impact on gross
profit resulting from customer negotiations. Overall, this has reduced the
profitability of the long-term care business. Second, the Company two
most significant equipment suppliers had manufacturing product recalls and
production issues that materially disrupted availability of products
and therefore, impacted net sales.
In addition, as discussed in Note 1, during the fourth quarter the Company
adopted SAB 101, effective April 3, 1999. The impact of this accounting
change on fiscal 2000 is shown below.

The Company has employment agreements with certain executive officers which
provide that in the event of their termination or resignation, under certain
conditions, the Company may be required to continue salary payments and provide
insurance for a period ranging from 12 to 36 months for the Chief Executive
Officer and from 3 to 12 months for other executives and to repurchase a portion
or all of the shares of common stock held by the executives upon their demand at
the fair market value at the time of repurchase. The period of salary and
insurance continuation and the level of stock repurchases are based on the
conditions of the termination or resignation.
F-38 During fiscal 2000, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the PSS World
Medical, Inc. Officer Retention Bonus Plan and the PSS World Medical, Inc.
Corporate Office Employee Retention Bonus Plan. Refer to Note 4, Charges
included in General and Administrative Expenses for further discussion.
During the second  quarter of fiscal year 2000,  the Company  received
approximately $65 million relating to a favorable medical x-ray film antitrust
settlement claim. The amount is classified as other income in the accompanying
consolidated statement of income.
PSS and certain of its current officers and directors were named as defendants
in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed on or about May 28, 1998.
The allegations are based upon a decline in the PSS stock price following
announcements by PSS in May 1998 regarding the Gulf South merger, which resulted
in earnings below analyst expectations. The Company believes that the
allegations contained in the complaints are without merit and intends to defend
vigorously against the claims. However, the lawsuits are in early stages, and
there can be no assurances that this litigation will ultimately be resolved on
terms that are favorable to the Company.
Although the Company does not manufacture products, the distribution of medical
supplies and equipment entails inherent risks of product liability. The Company
has not experienced any significant product liability claims and maintains
product liability insurance coverage. In addition, the Company is party to
various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal
course of business. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty,
management believes that the outcome of any proceedings or claims which are
pending or known to be threatened will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.
On September 30, 1999, DI entered into a three year distributorship agreement
with an imaging supply vendor. The agreement stipulates that, among other
things, in the event of termination of the agreement due to a change in control
of DI, the Company will pay liquidated damages to the vendor in the amount of
the lesser of $6 million or $250,000 times the number of months remaining under
the agreement.
19. ABBOTT LABORATORIES DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
On March 27, 1995, the Company signed a Distribution Agreement with Abbott
Laboratories  providing for the exclusive distribution of certain Abbott
diagnostic products. The Abbott Agreement, effective April 1, 1995, has a
five-year term, although it may be terminated earlier if the Company fails to
meet certain performance objectives. Simultaneous with the closing of the Abbott
Agreement, Abbott purchased 825,000 unregistered, restricted shares of PSS
common stock. A three-year irrevocable proxy to the PSS Board of Directors and a
perpetual stand still agreement were provided by Abbott in the Stock Purchase
Agreement.
The original 5 year agreement provides for an annual one year evergreen
provision. Since neither Abbott nor the Company notified the other of a
termination, the agreement extended for another year. The Company and Abbott are
negotiating a new 5 year agreement and have agreed to operating terms and
objectives for the evergreen year 6.
20. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
The Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 21, 2000
with Fisher Scientific International, Inc. Fisher, pursuant to which PSS and
Fisher will combine business operations and PSS will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Fisher. The merger is subject to various conditions, including
approval of the shareholders of PSS and Fisher, filings with and compliance with
securities and antitrust laws, the financial and operating performance of PSS
and certain other matters.                    F-39         SCHEDULE II--VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS
