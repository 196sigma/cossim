management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP Seattle, Washington October26, 2001 31 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC.

STATEMENTS 1.Description of
the Company F5 Networks, Inc. the Company was
incorporated on February26, 1996 in the State of
Washington and is a leading provider of integrated Internet
traffic and content management solutions designed to improve the
availability and performance of mission-critical Internet-based
servers and applications. The Companys proprietary
software-based solutions monitor and manage local and
geographically dispersed servers and intelligently direct
traffic to the server best able to handle a users request.
The Company purchases material component parts and certain
licensed software from suppliers and generally contracts with
third parties for the assembly of products. The Company operates
in one segment providing integrated internet traffic and content
management solutions. 2.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Sates of America.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and all majority owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
year balances to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net loss,
shareholders equity or cash flows. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements is in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates that are particularly susceptible to
changes in the near term are the adequacy of allowances for
sales returns and bad debt, inventory obsolescence, warranty
costs and deferred taxes. Cash Equivalents and Short-term
Investments Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments,
consisting of investments in money market funds and short-term
investments which are readily convertible to cash without
penalty and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
The Companys cash equivalents and short term investments
balance consists of the following in thousands September 30 2001 2000 Cash 18,321 18,596 Short-term investments 51,462 34,603 69,783 53,199 36 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Concentration of Credit Risk The Company places its temporary cash investments
with five major financial institutions. The Companys customers are from diverse
industries and geographic locations. Net revenues from
international customers are primarily denominated in U.S.
Dollars and were approximately $350million 206million and $22million for the years ended
September30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. During
fiscal 2001 no single reseller or customer exceeded 10% of the
Companys net revenue or accounts receivable balance.
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, one of the Companys
resellers, Exodus Communications, accounted for 14% and 22% of
net revenue and 8% and 16% of the Companys accounts
receivable balance, respectively. In association with Exodus
filing Chapter11 bankruptcy, the Company recorded a
non-recurring adjustment to its bad-debt expense of
$175million and $226,000 in cost of goods sold related to
the leased inventory during fiscal 2001. The Company does not
require collateral to support credit sales. Allowances are
maintained for potential credit losses and sales returns. Inventories Inventories consist of hardware and the related
component parts and are recorded at the lower of cost or market
as determined by the first-in, first-out method. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents a restricted escrow
account established in connection with a lease agreement for the
companys corporate headquarters. Under the term of the
lease, a $60million standby letter of credit is required
through November 2012, unless the lease is terminated before
then. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of
capital leases are provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets of 2 to 5years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term
of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is
charged to expense as incurred and expenditures for major
improvements are capitalized at cost. Gains or losses on the
disposition of assets in the normal course of business are
reflected in the results of operations at the time of disposal. Software Development Costs Software development costs incurred in
conjunction with product development are charged to research and
development expense until technological feasibility is
established. Thereafter, until the product is released for sale,
software development costs are capitalized and reported at the
lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value of each
product. The establishment of technological feasibility and the
on-going assessment of recoverability of costs require
considerable judgment by the Company with respect to certain
internal and external factors, including, but not limited to,
anticipated future gross product revenues, estimated economic
life and changes in hardware and software technology. The
Company amortizes capitalized software costs using the
straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the
product, generally three years. In fiscal 2001, the Company
capitalized $327,000 in software development costs, generally
representing labor costs, and recorded no related amortization. 37 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically evaluates the carrying
value of long-lived assets to be held and used, including, but
not limited to, property and equipment, other assets, and
deferred income taxes, when events and circumstances warrant
such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is
considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow
from the asset is separately identifiable and is less than its
carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the
long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the
anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with
the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of
are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are
reduced for the cost to dispose. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo48,
Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, SEC
Staff Accounting Bulleting SABNo101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,
Statement of Position SOP No97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP No98-9
Modification of SOP No97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions. The Company sells products through resellers,
original equipment manufacturers and other channel partners, as
well as to end users, under similar terms. Typically this
combines software license, installation and customer support
elements into a package with a single bundled price
and allocates a portion of the sales price to each element of
the bundled package based on their respective fair values when
the individual elements are sold separately. Revenues from the
license of software, net of an allowance for estimated returns,
are recognized when the product has been shipped and the
customer is obligated to pay for the product. Installation
revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the
customers site. Revenues for customer support are
recognized on a straight-line basis over the service contract
term. Estimated sales returns are based on historical experience
by product and are recorded at the time revenues are recognized. The following presents revenues by shipment
destination for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999 in
thousands September 30 2001 2000 1999 United States 72,406 88,047 25,672 Europe 10,004 7,029 1,655 Asia Pacific 24,957 13,569 498 107,367 108,645 27,825 Warranty Expense The Company generally offers warranties between
90days and one year depending on whether it relates to
hardware or software. Estimated future warranty obligations
related to products are provided by charges to operations in the
period in which the related revenue is recognized. These
estimates are based on historical warranty experience and other
relevant information of which the Company is aware. During the
years ended September30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 warranty
expense was $04million, $23million and
$03million, respectively. 38 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense was approximately $15million 16million and $10million for the years ended
September30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the
liability method of accounting. Under the liability method,
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between
the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
at enacted tax rates in effect in the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to
estimated amounts expected to be realized. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of F5 Networks, Ltd., F5
Networks, Singapore Pte. Ltd. and F5 Networks, Japan K.K. have
been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No52 Foreign
Currency Translation. Under the provisions of this
Statement, all assets and liabilities in the balance sheet of
the subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates, and
translation gains and losses are reported as a component of
comprehensive income lossand are accumulated in a
separate component of shareholders equity. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect
of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency, including US
dollars. Gains and losses on those foreign currency transactions
are included in determining net income or loss for the period of
exchange. Transaction losses for the fiscal years ended
September30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 of $139,000, $84,000, and
$0, respectively, were charged to operations. Comprehensive Income Loss The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income, in June 1997. This
statement establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income in the financial statements and was adopted
by the Company during the quarter ended September30, 1999.
In addition to net income loss, comprehensive income
lossincludes charges or credits to equity that are not
the result of transactions with shareholders. For the Company,
this includes foreign currency translation and unrealized gains
and losses on investments. The Company has included components
of comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of
Shareholders Equity. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and FASB interpretation No44 FIN
No44 accounting for certain transactions involving
stock compensation, and complies with the disclosure provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123
SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB No25,
compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the
date of the grant, between the deemed fair value of the
Companys stock and the exercise price of the option. The
unearned compensation is being amortized in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No28
on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the
individual options. The Company accounts for equity instruments
issued to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No123. 39 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Fair Value of Financial Instruments For certain financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, recorded amounts approximate market value,
due to the short maturities of these instruments. Earnings per Share Basic net income loss per share is computed by
dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by
the weighted average number of common and dilutive common stock
equivalent shares outstanding during the period. For periods in
which the Company incurred a net loss, dilutive common stock
equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation as their
impact would have been antidilutive. The antidilutive securities
not included in diluted net loss per share calculation totaled
1,533,386 shares. The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted net income loss per share for the years
ended September30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 in thousands,
except per share data. Year Ended September30 2001 2000 1999 Numerator Net income loss 30,790 13,650 4,344 Denominator Weighted average shares outstanding

adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS133 which establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
and for hedging activities. SFAS133 requires that an
entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on
the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. The Company designates the derivatives based upon
criteria established by SFAS133. For a derivative
designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized
in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting
loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being
hedged. For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is
initially reported as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into
earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The
ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings
immediately. The impact of derivatives on the Companys
financial position in fiscal 2001, has been insignificant. 40 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued New Accounting Pronouncements In July of 2001 the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard SFAS No141
Business Combinations which is effective for all
business combinations initiated after July1, 2001. SFAS
No141, supersedes APB Opinion No16, Business
Combinations, and FASB Statement No38, Accounting for
Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises and
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. Further, SFAS No141
requires certain intangibles to be recognized as assets apart
from goodwill if they meet certain criteria and also requires
expanded disclosures regarding the primary reasons for
consummation of the combination and the allocation of the
purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed by major balance sheet caption. The Company does not
believe the standard will have a significant impact on the
financial position of the company. In July of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001. SFAS No142 supercedes APB Opinion
No17, Intangible Assets, and addresses financial
accounting and reporting for intangible assets acquired
individually or with a group of other assets and the accounting
and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. Under the model set forth in
SFAS No142, goodwill is no longer amortized to earnings,
but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment. The
Company does not believe the standard will have a significant
impact on the financial position of the company. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
FASB143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It
applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development, and or the normal operation of a
long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. The
provisions of FAS143 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after June15, 2002, however early application is
permitted. The Company does not believe the standard will have a
significant impact its financial statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
This Statement supersedes FASB Statement No121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No30, Reporting the
Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the
disposal of a segment of a business. The provisions of
FAS144 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001. The Company is currently evaluating the
implications of adoption of FAS144 and anticipates
adopting its provisions in fiscal year 2002. 3.Inventories Inventories are comprised of the following in
thousands September30 2001 2000 Finished goods 3,283 2,045 Raw materials 1,347 3,186 Inventory provision 2,028 2,602 5,231 41 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Due to changes in current market conditions and a
revision of our sales forecast, a review was made of the
Companys inventory needs and an assessment of our future
purchase commitments during fiscal 2001. As a result, the
Company determined two provisions for excess inventory and
future purchase commitments would be recorded. The first
provision for excess inventory was charged to cost of revenues
in the amount of $39million, which consisted of a
$31million inventory valuation allowance and
approximately $800,000 of future purchase commitments. As of
September30, 2001, $15million of this reserve had
been utilized. The second provision for excess inventory was in
the amount of $10 million. This charge is associated with
charge is associated with the changes in the configuration of
the Companys EDGE-FX Cache product, which will increase
the functionality of the product. These costs are associated
with updating both existing inventory and product previously
sold to customers, as well as costs to fulfill existing purchase
commitments and have been included in cost of revenues for the
for the fiscal year ended September30, 2001. As of
September30, 2001, $232,000 of this reserve had been
utilized. 4.Property and

2001, the Company maintained a partial valuation allowance
consistent with prior year against its deferred tax assets. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, the Company re-evaluated
the need to provide a full valuation allowance. Due to changes
in the current economic environment and based on the weight of
all the available positive and negative evidence, the Company
determined that it was not more likely than not, that the
deferred taxes would be recognized and therefore, a full
valuation allowance should be provided to completely offset the
net deferred tax assets. 44 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

agreement on two buildings for a new corporate headquarters. The
lease commenced in July 2000 on the first building; and the
lease on the second building commenced in October 2000. The
lease for both buildings expires in 2012 with an option for
renewal. The Company established a restricted escrow account in
connection with this lease agreement. Under the term of the
lease, a $60million irrevocable standby letter of credit
is required through November 2012, unless the lease is
terminated before then. This amount has been included on the
Companys balance sheet as of September30, 2000 as a
component of restricted cash. The Company has surplus office
space of approximately 14,000 square feet which it subleased

subleased until 2012. On August8, 2001 a putative securities
class action, captioned Atlasv. F5Networks, Inc. et
al., Civil Action No01-CV-7342, was filed against the
firms that underwrote F5Networks initial public
offering, F5Networks, and several of its officers and
directors in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The complaint alleges violations of
Sections11 and15 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1933 and Section10b and Rule10b-5 promulgated
thereunder and Section20a of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 against the Company and its officers and directors, and
seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class that
purchased F5Networks common stock between
June4, 1999 and December6, 2000. On August15, 2001 a similar complaint,
captioned Leev. F5Networks, Inc. et al., Civil
Action No01-CV-7625, was filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The
complaint is substantially identical to the Atlas complaint: it
names the same defendants, contains the virtually identical
claims, and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported
class of purchasers of common stock during an identical class
period. Various plaintiffs have filed similar actions in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York asserting virtually identical allegations against more
than 200 other issuers. These cases have all been assigned to
the Hon.Shira A. Scheindlin for coordination and decisions
on pretrial motions, discovery, and related matters other than
trial. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to
the lawsuits and will defend itself vigorously in the
litigation. An unfavorable resolution of the actions could have
a material, adverse effect on the business, results of
operations or financial condition of the Company. 50 Table of Contents F5 NETWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The company may be subject to additional legal
proceedings, claims and litigation arising in the ordinary
course of business. Although the outcome of these matters is
currently not determinable, the Company does not expect that the
resolution of the actions could have a material, adverse effect
on the business, results of operations or financial condition of
the Company. 10.Related Party
Transactions In March 1999, the Company issued 150,000 shares
of common stock to an officer of the Company in exchange for a
note receivable. These shares were acquired by exercising stock
options that vest over a period of four years. The note bears
interest at a rate of 483%, is collateralized by the shares,
partially guaranteed by the officer and is due in 2003. In
fiscal 2000, total payments of $281,000 were received on the
loan. Under the pledge agreement, the Company has the obligation
to repurchase any remaining unvested shares, and the note
becomes due upon the officers termination. Further, the
shares may not be transferred until they are vested, and the
related portion of the loan is repaid. In fiscal 2001, the
officer left the company and returned unvested shares totaling
approximately 56,000 options to purchase shares of common stock,
which were subsequently cancelled. In fiscal 2001, total
payments of $188,000 were received on the loan. 11.Employee
Benefit Plans The Company provides a 401k savings plan
whereby eligible employees may voluntarily contribute a
percentage of their compensation. Under the provision of the
plan the Company may, at their discretion, match a portion of
the employees eligible contributions. Contributions to the
plan during the years ended September30, 2001, 2000 and
