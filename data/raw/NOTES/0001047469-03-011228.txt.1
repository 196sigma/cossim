REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS    To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity deficit and of cash flows present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
As
discussed in Note5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.

CIPHERGEN BIOSYSTEMS,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company  Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. the Company or Ciphergen develops, manufactures and sells ProteinChip Systems for life science researchers.
These systems consist of ProteinChip Readers, ProteinChip Software and related accessories which are used in conjunction with consumable ProteinChip Arrays. These products are sold primarily to
biologists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government research laboratories. The Company also provides research services through its Biomarker Discovery
Centers and chromatography sorbents used for protein purification.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company reported its ownership interest in Ciphergen Biosystems
KK, a joint venture in Japan, using the equity method of accounting through August31, 2002, at which time the Company acquired a majority interest and began consolidation of Ciphergen
Biosystems KK.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain Risks and Uncertainties  The Company products and services are currently concentrated in a single segment of the life science research field which is characterized by rapid
technological advances and changes in customer requirements. The success of the Company depends on management ability to anticipate and to respond quickly and adequately to technological
developments in its industry, changes in customer requirements and changes in industry standards. Any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or services could have a
material adverse effect on the Company business and operating results. 
The
Company licenses certain technologies that are used in products that represent substantially all of its revenues. An inability to retain such technology licenses could result in a
material adverse effect to the Company. Additionally, some of the raw materials and components used in its products are from single-source suppliers. If the Company is unable to obtain such raw
materials and components, its financial condition and operating results could be significantly impacted.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
51  Investments  Management determines the appropriate classification of the Company investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase, and
re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies all securities as available-for-sale and carries them at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses related to these securities included as a component of other comprehensive income until realized. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. 
The
Company investment objectives include the safety and preservation of invested funds and liquidity of investments that is sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. Cash, cash
equivalents and investments in debt securities are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and commercial companies and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit
exposure.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of other financial instruments approximates their fair value. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with
similar terms, the carrying value of its debt obligations approximates fair value.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Most of
the Company cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2002 were deposited with financial institutions in the United States and exceeded federally insured amounts. The Company also
maintains minimal cash deposits with banks in Western Europe, China and Japan. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. 
The
Company accounts receivable are derived from sales made to customers located in North America, Europe and Asia. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. No customer
accounted
for more than 10% of revenue in 2002 or 2001. In 2000, Ciphergen Biosystems KK, the Japanese joint venture, accounted for 11% of revenue.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value, cost being determined on the first-in, first-out method.  Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their economic life or the term of the underlying lease, machinery and equipment over two to eight years, computer equipment and
software over three to four years, and furniture and 
52  fixtures over three to ten years. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to operations as incurred. Gains and losses upon asset disposal are reflected in operations in the year of
disposition.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired in the Company
acquisitions of IllumeSys Pacific,Inc. in 1997, Ciphergen Technologies,Inc. in 1998, BioSepra S.A. in 2001 and Ciphergen Biosystems KK in 2002. Prior to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142 SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January1, 2002, goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis
over five years. 
Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment at least annually and in the interim whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. Upon
adoption of SFAS142, the Company performed a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and noted no such impairment of goodwill. 
Other
intangible assets consist of patents and developed product technology arising from the acquisition of the BioSepra business. These intangibles are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of seven years, and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may no longer be recoverable.  Long-lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability is measured by comparison of the asset carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets.  Warranty Liability  The Company generally offers a warranty on each ProteinChip System and Interface shipped. These warranties typically include coverage for parts and labor and
software bug fixes for a specified period, typically one year. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records this liability at the time product
revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. The Company
periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue from product sales is recognized upon product shipment, provided no significant obligations remain and collections of the receivables are deemed probable.
Revenue from research contracts is recognized as the work is performed, based on the achievement of substantive milestones described in the contracts. Revenue from up-front payments is
deferred and recognized ratably over the expected term of the research contract. Payments for maintenance services are usually prepaid, and the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term
of the service contract, which is generally 12months. For multiple element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each component of the contract based on the fair value of the elements. The
revenue attributable to any undelivered elements is 
53  deferred and is subsequently recognized as the Company fulfills its obligations to deliver those goods or services.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Software is an integral component of the Company ProteinChip Systems. Software
development costs incurred in the research and development of new products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established. To date, products and upgrades have generally
reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time.  Advertising Costs  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $354,000 for 2002, $313,000 for 2001 and $211,000 for 2000.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic method of accounting. Unearned compensation expense is based on
the difference, if any, on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise price. Unearned compensation is amortized and expensed using an accelerated method. The
Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees using the fair value method of accounting. 
Had
compensation expense for options granted to employees, officers and directors been determined based on fair value at the grant date, the Company net loss per share attributable to
common stockholders would have increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per share data: Years Ended December 31 2002
2001
2000 Net loss attributable to common stockholders as reported 29,072 25,812 47,532 Add: Cost recognized 2,148 4,695 7,958 Less: Assumed stock compensation cost 4,693 6,460 9,347 Pro forma net loss attributable to common stockholders 31,617 27,577 48,921 Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders As reported 108 097 409 Pro forma 117 104 420 The
value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in 2002, 2001 and 2000 with the following weighted assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2002
2001
2000 Risk-free interest rate
41 46 62 Expected average life
5 years
5 years
5 years Expected dividends Volatility
60 75 75 54 
The
expected average life is based on the assumption that stock options on average are exercised 5years after they are granted. The risk-free interest rate was
calculated in accordance with the grant date and expected average life. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $253 410 and $1232 per share, respectively.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currencies of BioSepra S.A. and Ciphergen Biosystems KK are the euro and yen, respectively. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these
operations are translated into U.S. dollars
using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and losses from
foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries' financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders' equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive
income. 
The
functional currency of all other non-U.S. operations is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated into
U.S. dollars at current period-end exchange rates and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical rates of exchange. Income and expense
elements are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are recorded as other
income or loss in the statement of operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In November2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Interpretation No45 FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor balance sheet upon issuance of a
guarantee. In addition, FIN 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued, including a reconciliation of changes in the entity product warranty liabilities. The initial
recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45
are effective for financial statements ending after December15, 2002. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, of adopting this standard. 
In
November2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on Issue No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF Issue
No00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of
EITF Issue No00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any,
of adopting this standard. 
In
December2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148 SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, Transition and
Disclosure. SFAS148 
55  provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS148 also requires that disclosures of
the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS148 requires
disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of SFAS148 are effective for fiscal years ended after December15,
2002. The interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods ending after December15, 2002. The Company has no
current plans to change its method of accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The Company has complied with the annual disclosure requirement in its 2002 consolidated financial statements. 
In
January2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No51. FIN 46
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 is effective immediately for all
new variable interest entities created or acquired after January31, 2003. For variable interest entities created or acquired prior to February1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be
applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after June15, 2003. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, of adopting this standard.

It provided
for the issuance of a total of 949,113 shares of SeriesB preferred stock upon achievement of specified development milestones. All preferred stock converted to common stock on a
one-for-one basis on September26, 2000 in conjunction with the Company initial public offering. Through December31, 1999, a total of 712,613 shares of
preferred stock were issued under the agreement. During 2000, two additional milestones were attained and 25,800 shares of preferred stock valued at $379,000 and 12,900 shares of common stock valued
at $142,000 were issued, respectively. In 2001, a total of 51,600 common shares valued at $268,000 were issued upon the attainment of four additional milestones. In 2002, 49,450 common shares valued
at $131,000 were issued upon completion of a milestone. The remaining 96,750 shares will be issued as common stock upon the achievement of additional milestones. The value of these shares was recorded
as research and development expense when the development milestones were achieved. 
61  Contingencies  The Company is currently a party to three legal proceedings. 
1Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc., Ciphergen Technologies,Inc. and IllumeSys Pacific,Inc. v. Molecular Analytical
Systems,Inc., LumiCyte,Inc. and T. William Hutchens. On July12, 2000, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California
against Molecular Analytical Systems,Inc. MAS and LumiCyte,Inc. LumiCyte requesting a declaration of Ciphergen rights, including that Ciphergen has the right to sell
information and service products, and requesting a preliminary injunction preventing MAS from terminating the sublicense agreements. In October2000, Ciphergen made additional claims against
MAS and LumiCyte, and added T. William Hutchens as an individual defendant. Hutchens is the Chief Executive Officer of both MAS and LumiCyte, as well as a former officer and director of Ciphergen. He
is presently the beneficial owner of less than 10% of Ciphergen outstanding common stock. Ciphergen action seeks, among other things, damages and injunctive relief against defendants for unfair
competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of contract, as well as an injunction precluding defendants from operating in Ciphergen licensed markets. In October2000, MAS and
LumiCyte filed a cross-complaint against Ciphergen, Ciphergen Technologies,Inc. and IllumeSys Pacific,Inc., the three plaintiffs which filed the underlying lawsuit against MAS and
LumiCyte described above. The cross-complaint alleges claims for breach of contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets
and declaratory relief regarding the rights of the parties under the two technology transfer sublicense agreements between MAS and Ciphergen. The cross-complaint also seeks to terminate the sublicense
agreements, to obtain injunctive relief, to prevent use of alleged trade secrets of MAS, and damages. Ciphergen and MAS have entered into an agreement that provides that MAS' license termination
notices are suspended pending the conclusion of this lawsuit. In May2001, the Company amended its complaint and brought additional claims against MAS, LumiCyte and Hutchens. 
2Molecular Analytical Systems,Inc. v. Ciphergen Biosystems. The proceeding was filed December9, 1999 in
the United States Trademark and Appeal Board. Ciphergen applied for registration of the term SELDI as a trademark. MAS has opposed registration of the trademark and is seeking to have the trademark
registered in its name instead. The Trademark and Appeal Board has suspended the proceeding until resolution of the lawsuit described above. 
3On
July27, 2001, the Company served a demand for arbitration on T. William Hutchens under the July28, 1998 Stock Exchange Agreement among Ciphergen,
Ciphergen Technologies,Inc., Hutchens and others. The demand for arbitration asserts that Hutchens, who was a selling shareholder of Ciphergen Technologies, made representations and warranties
to Ciphergen about the conduct of Ciphergen Technologies' business and its ownership of assets that are contrary to certain claims asserted in the cross-complaint filed by MAS and LumiCyte and,
therefore, that he must pay Ciphergen attorneys fees and indemnify Ciphergen for any losses it might incur resulting from filing of the cross-claims, regardless of their merit. The parties have
agreed to stay the arbitration until the earlier of August1, 2002, or the resolution of any of several of plaintiffs' and cross-complainants' causes of action. 
A
trial relating to these matters was scheduled to begin on March3, 2003. However, the parties agreed jointly to remove the case from the March3, 2003 trial calendar and
have been engaged in settlement discussions. The settlement terms currently under discussion involve Ciphergen receiving a grant or assignment of rights, in exchange for Ciphergen payment of
approximately $3million and approximately 125million shares of Ciphergen common stock, as well as up to $10million in royalties over a 10-year period. The parties
would also exchange mutual releases of certain claims in connection 
62  with the settlement. In light of the business opportunities presented by settlement and the risks and uncertainties and costs associated with continued litigation, management believes that settlement
on agreeable terms would enable Ciphergen to further exploit its products, technology and services, including its rapidly growing Biomarker Discovery Center services business. However, there can be no
assurance that the parties will execute and deliver definitive settlement agreements on these terms, or at all. 
9.Stockholders' Equity  Stock Split  On September26, 2000 the board of directors and stockholders approved a 043-for-1 reverse stock split of the common and preferred
stock. All share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted accordingly.  Initial Public Offering  The Company had its initial public offering IPO of 5,500,000 shares of common stock on September28, 2000 at a price of $16 per share. On
October3, 2000 the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. The IPO generated aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
$1012million for the Company. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $924million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately
$71million and expenses of the offering of approximately $17million. Concurrent with the IPO, all of the Company preferred stock and preferred stock warrants automatically
converted to common stock and common stock warrants, respectively.  Preferred Stock  In March2000, the Company issued 4,468,070 shares of SeriesE preferred stock Series E at $6395 per share resulting in net cash proceeds of
$269million. The difference between the conversion price and the fair market value per share of the common stock on the transaction date resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of
$267million which has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the SeriesE financing, the Company issued the
underwriter warrants to purchase 63,053 shares of SeriesE preferred stock for $6395 per share. The warrants had a fair value of $832 per share based on a calculation using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model at the time of issuance. The aggregate amount allocated to the warrants based on the relative value of the warrants to the SeriesE preferred stock was $213,000. In
March2000, the underwriters exercised the warrants. The resulting difference between the exercise price of the warrants and fair market value of the common stock underlying the SeriesE
preferred stock resulted in an additional beneficial conversion feature of $542,000 on the date these warrants were exercised. This has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the consolidated
financial statements. 
At
December31, 2002 and 2001, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock were authorized, but no shares were issued or outstanding. 
10.Stock Options, Warrants and Employee Stock Purchase Plan  1993 Stock Option Plan  The Company has no shares of common stock reserved for sale to employees, directors or consultants under its 1993 Stock Option Plan the 1993 Plan. Under the
1993 Plan, options were 
63  granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of the common stock for nonstatutory and statutory stock options, respectively. Options are exercisable when granted and such
unvested shares are subject to repurchase upon termination of employment. Should the employment of the holders of common stock subject to repurchase terminate prior to full vesting of the outstanding
shares, the Company may repurchase all unvested shares at a price per share equal to the original exercise price. Options generally vest monthly over a period of five years. At December31,
2002, a total of approximately 150,000 shares of common stock were subject to repurchase by the Company at a weighted average repurchase price of $250 per share. Unexercised options generally expire
ten years from the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the Company common stock. Since the Company IPO, no options have been granted under
the
1993 Plan. Options for 80,113 and 137,621 shares were cancelled during 2002 and 2001, respectively, and the shares reserved under the 1993 Plan were reduced by the same amount.  2000 Stock Plan  In April2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Stock Plan the 2000 Plan. At December31, 2002, the Company had 429,651 shares of common stock
reserved for sale to employees, directors and consultants under this stock option plan. Under the 2000 Plan, options may be granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of
the common stock for nonstatutory and statutory stock options, respectively. Options generally vest monthly over a period of five years. During 2000 there was no activity under the 2000 Plan. During
2001, options for 1,105,100 shares were granted and options for 41,517 shares were cancelled. No options were exercised in 2001. During 2002, options for 1,183,400 shares were granted, options for
2,666 shares were exercised, and options for 126,634 shares were cancelled. 
On
February13, 2003, an additional 1,100,000 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan.

During the year ended December31, 2000, the exercise prices of all options granted were less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the respective
grant dates. During the years ended December31, 2001 and 2002, the exercise prices of all options granted were equal to fair market value on the dates of grant. During the period from
April1997 through December31, 2002, the Company recorded $218million of stock-based compensation related to stock options granted to consultants and employees. For options
granted to consultants, the Company determined the fair value of the options 
65  using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected lives of five years; weighted average risk-free rate calculated using rates between 45% and 62 expected dividend yield of zero percent; volatility of 75% and deemed values of common stock between $035 and $1467 per share. Stock compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with an
accelerated amortization method, over the vesting periods of the related options, which are generally five years. 
The
allocation of stock-based compensation expense by functional area was as follows in thousands: Years Ended December 31 2002
2001
2000 Cost of revenue 124 232 269 Research and development 36 583 1,454 Sales and marketing 398 919 1,395 General and administrative 1,586 2,913 6,192 Total stock-based compensation 2,072 4,647 9,310 Warrants 
No warrants were issued or exercised in 2002. At December31, 2002, the Company had warrants to purchase 9,010 shares of common stock outstanding at a
weighted average exercise price of $354 per share. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In April2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company
through payroll deductions. Purchases are made semi-annually at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering commencement date or 85% of the closing
price at the end of the purchase period. At December31, 2002, the Company had 75,480 shares of common stock reserved for purchase by employees under this Plan. During 2002 and 2001, purchases
of 175,519 and 114,001 shares, respectively, were made under this Plan. There was no activity under this plan in 2000. 
On
February13, 2003, an additional 250,000 shares were reserved for purchase under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 11.Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the current tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts expected to be realized. 
The
provision for income taxes was due to current foreign income taxes, which were $61,000 and $143,000 for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Based
on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has
provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2002.

tax assets consisted of the following in thousands: December 31 2002

of December31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $824million for federal and $256million for state tax purposes. If not
utilized, these carryforwards will expire beginning in 2009 for federal purposes and 2003 for state purposes. 
The
Company had research credit carryforwards of approximately $21million and $19million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the
federal carryforward will expire in various amounts beginning in 2009. The California credit can be carried forward indefinitely. The
Internal Revenue Code limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event
the Company has a change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted. 
12.Net Loss per Share 
Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders
for the period by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period, if their effect is dilutive. Potential common shares include common stock subject to
repurchase, common stock issuable under the Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants.

In January1999, the Company formed Ciphergen Biosystems KK and took a 30% equity interest in this joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation to distribute
the Company products in Japan. On August31, 2002, the Company acquired an additional 40% ownership in Ciphergen Biosystems KK, bringing its total ownership to 70%. Ciphergen believes
acquiring majority control of Ciphergen Biosystems KK will facilitate expansion of the Company activities in Japan, including the establishment of a Biomarker Discovery Center and the distribution
of BioSepra sorbents. The Company paid $424,000 in cash for the additional shares of Ciphergen Biosystems KK common stock and incurred direct acquisition costs of $22,000. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Ciphergen Biosystems KK and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were
included in the Company consolidated financial statements beginning September1, 2002. The Company acquired $1,318,000 of cash with Ciphergen Biosystems KK and paid $3,960,000 to repay
working capital loans Sumitomo had provided to the joint venture. 
68  The
total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows in thousands: Tangible net assets acquired Accounts receivable, net, and other current assets 1,352 Inventories 376 Property and equipment 1,300 Other tangible assets 326 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including working capital loans 5,469 Capital lease obligations 376 2,491 Excess of purchase price over net assets acquired 1,619 Net cash acquired upon purchase of Ciphergen Biosystems KK common stock 872 The
amount of the purchase price in excess of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and will be evaluated for impairment at least annually and more often if circumstances
warrant. 
14.Acquisition of BioSepra 
On July31, 2001, the Company acquired BioSepra S.A. BioSepra and certain other assets related to BioSepra chromatography business from Invitrogen
Corporation. Located near Paris, France, BioSepra develops, manufactures and sells chromatography sorbents for large-scale purification of proteins. Ciphergen believes that BioSepra protein
chromatography products, combined with Ciphergen ProteinChip Systems, will create a novel approach to protein purification and address a significant bottleneck in the field of proteomics. The
Company paid approximately $120million in cash, net of cash acquired, while incurring direct acquisition costs of approximately $257,000. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of BioSepra and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in the Company consolidated financial
statements as of August1, 2001 through December31, 2002. The
total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on independent appraisals and management estimates as follows in
thousands: Tangible net assets acquired Accounts receivable, net, and other current assets 2,028 Inventories, net 2,067 Property and equipment, net 3,859 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,427 Capital lease obligations 2,249 4,278 Acquired in-process technology 1,000 Completed technology 5,400 Patents 400 Excess of purchase price over net assets acquired 1,179 Total purchase price 12,257 69 
In
connection with the purchase of BioSepra, the Company recorded a $10million charge to acquired in-process technology. The amount was determined by identifying
research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The value of the projects identified to be in progress was determined by
estimating the future cash flows of the product and discounting those net cash flows back to their present value at a discount rate consistent with the inherent risk of the particular project. The net
cash flows from the identified in-process projects were expected to commence at various times from 2002 to 2004 and included estimates of research and development costs needed to bring the
project from its current state of development to a point of commercial feasibility. The cash flows were based on expected future revenues, cost of revenues, selling, general and administrative costs,
research and development costs needed to maintain the project throughout its life cycle, and applicable income taxes for the projects. The discount rates used in the present value calculations were
derived from the weighted-average cost of capital of BioSepra and adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle of the
particular project. Such discount rates ranged between 19% and 25% for all projects. Development of the technologies remains a substantial risk to the Company due to factors including the remaining
effort to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets and competitive threats from other companies. Actual expenses incurred to date have not been materially different from
those used in the calculations described above. 
The
amounts allocated to completed technology and patents are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of seven years using the straight-line method. 
The
amount of the purchase price in excess of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and will be periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with FAS142. The
following pro forma summary is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations for future periods or that actually
would have been realized had the Company and BioSepra been a consolidated entity during the periods presented. The summary combines the results of operations as if BioSepra had been acquired as of the
beginning of the periods presented. The summary includes the impact of certain adjustments such as amortization of intangibles. Additionally, the in-process technology charge of
$10million discussed above has been excluded from the periods presented as it arose from the acquisition of BioSepra. Twelve Months Ended December31 2001

related to the early exercise of options become due immediately upon termination of employment. At December31, 2002, accrued interest on these notes amounted to $249,000. 
During
the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded revenue in the amount of $08million and $12million, respectively, on sales to related
parties. These sales were transactions related to the sale of equipment and consumables principally to the Company Japanese joint venture prior to August31, 2002, at which point the Company
acquired majority control. The Company also purchased $894,000 and $372,000 of inventory in 2002 and 2001, respectively, from a related party, and in 2002 and 2001 made non-cash payments
in the form of Ciphergen common stock to this related party under the terms of a joint development agreement. See Note8. 
17.Segment Information and Geographic Data 
Ciphergen revenue is derived from the sales of interrelated products and services on a worldwide basis. Although discrete components that earn revenues and
incur expenses exist, significant expenses such as sales and marketing and corporate administration are not incurred by nor allocated to these operating units but rather are employed by the entire
enterprise. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker evaluates resource allocation not on a product or geographic basis, but rather on an enterprise-wide basis. Therefore,
management has determined that Ciphergen operates in only one reportable segment, which is the protein research tools and collaborative services business.
