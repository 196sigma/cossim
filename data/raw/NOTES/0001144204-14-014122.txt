REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of
Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income loss, cash flows and shareholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule included in a2. These financial statements
and schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries
at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 Framework and our report dated March 7, 2014
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ Ernst Young LLP

in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated 1. Organization and Nature of Business Stoneridge, Inc. and its subsidiaries are global designers
and manufacturers of highly engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the commercial, automotive,
agricultural, motorcycle and off-highway vehicle markets. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Stoneridge, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company analyzes its ownership interests in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810 to determine whether they are VIEs and, if
so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary.The Companys investment in Minda Stoneridge Instruments
Ltd. Minda at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was determined under the provisions of ASC Topic 810 to be an unconsolidated
entity and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting based on our 49% noncontrolling interest. On December 31, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition
of an additional 24% controlling interest in PST Eletrnica Ltda. PST. As a result, the Company owns 74%
of the outstanding equity of PST. PSTs results for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012 were consolidated such that 100% of PSTs operations were included in each line from net sales through net income in
the Companys consolidated statements of operations with the 26% noncontrolling interest reduced increased in the net
income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest line. PSTs results for the year ended December 31, 2011 were
accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting such that our 50% portion of PSTs
after-tax earnings were included within equity in earnings of investees in the consolidated statements of operations as a controlling
interest in PST was not acquired until the close of business on December 31, 2011. Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including certain self-insured risks and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Because actual results could differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions
as new information becomes available. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companys cash and cash equivalents are actively
traded money market funds with short-term investments in marketable securities, primarily U.S. government securities. Cash and
cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the highly liquid nature and short-term duration of
the underlying securities. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk Revenues are principally generated from the commercial, automotive,
agricultural, motorcycle and off-highway vehicle markets. The Companys largest customers were Deere Company Deere
and Navistar International Corporation Navistar, primarily related to the Wiring reportable segment, and accounted
for the following percentages of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011

in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet
its financial obligations, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized
receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. Additionally, the Company reviews historical trends
for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts. If economic circumstances change substantially,
estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be reduced by a material amount. The Company does not have
collateral requirements with its customers. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost using either the
first-in, first-out FIFO or average cost methods or market. The Company evaluates and adjusts as necessary its
excess and obsolescence reserve on a quarterly basis. Excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales
or usage for a reasonable period. The Company has guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number
of months of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage. Management uses its judgment to forecast sales or usage
and to determine what constitutes a reasonable period. Inventory cost includes material, labor and overhead. Inventories consist

31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Pre-production Costs Related to Long-term Supply Arrangements Engineering, research and development and other design and
development costs for products sold on long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a contractual
guarantee for reimbursement from the customer. Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply
arrangements for which the Company either has title to the assets or has the noncancelable right to use the assets during the
term of the supply arrangement are capitalized in property, plant and equipment and amortized to cost of sales over the shorter
of the term of the arrangement or over the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically three to five years. Costs for molds,
dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee
to a lump sum reimbursement from the customer are capitalized as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets within
the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts recorded related to these pre-production costs as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were
$12,944 and $8,631, respectively.   45

shorter of lease term or 3-10 years Maintenance and repair expenditures that are not considered
improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property, plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures
for improvements and major renewals are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on the disposition is recorded in the consolidated statements
of operations as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Impairment of Long-Lived or Finite-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets
and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors the Company considers important that could trigger testing of the related asset groups for an impairment include current
period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, a projection or forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses, significant adverse changes in the business climate within a particular business or current expectations that
a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. To test for
impairment, the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and disposal of the asset or asset group
is compared to its carrying value. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the
group of assets that are largely independent of cash flows of other assets. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently
identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify
projected cash flows. If these undiscounted cash flows are less than their respective carrying values, an impairment charge would
be recognized to the extent that the carrying values exceed estimated fair values. Although third-party estimates of fair value
are utilized when available, the estimation of undiscounted cash flows and fair value requires us to make assumptions regarding
future operating results. The results of the impairment testing are dependent on these estimates which require judgment. The occurrence
of certain events, including changes in economic and competitive conditions, could impact cash flows eventually realized and managements

indicated During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
an impairment charge of $807 in its Wiring reportable segment related to certain capitalized software costs that were determined
to no longer represent a future realizable benefit. This charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a
component of selling, general and administrative expenses. No material impairment charges were recorded in 2013 or 2012 for long-lived
or finite-lived intangible assets. Acquisitions PST Eletrnica Ltda. On December 31, 2011, the Company acquired a controlling interest
in PST, by increasing its interest from 50% to 74%. Prior to the acquisition of the additional interest, the PST joint venture
was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On the date of acquisition of controlling interest, PST became a consolidated
subsidiary and a new reportable segment of the Company. PSTs results of operations were consolidated and included in the
Companys consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013
and 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2011, PSTs results of operations and cash flows were included in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows as equity in earnings of investees. PSTs financial position is included
in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2013 and 2012. As a result of obtaining a controlling interest in PST, the
Companys previously held 50% equity interest in PST of $38,746 was remeasured to an acquisition date fair value of $104,118.
The Company recognized a one-time non-cash pre-tax gain on previously held equity interest of $65,372 as a result of this remeasurment
in the fourth quarter of 2011. The acquisition date fair value of the total consideration
transferred consisted of the following   Cash

5, 2012, in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement. The fair value of the Common Shares transferred was based on
the closing market price of the Companys Common Shares on the acquisition date, less a discount for a lack of short-term
marketability as the Common Shares transferred were issued through a private placement. Goodwill of $67,118 was calculated as the excess of the fair
value of consideration transferred over the fair market value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and represents the future
economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be separately recognized. Goodwill is reported in the Companys
PST segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes. The Company identified $97,398 of intangible assets that include 47,126 assigned to customer lists with a 15 year useful life; $31,400 assigned to trademarks with a 20 year useful life; and
$18,872 assigned to technology with a 17 year weighted-average useful life. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets
was determined using an income approach.   47

and manufactures a wide variety of electrical solutions for the military, automotive, marine and specialty vehicle markets. The
Company purchased the remaining 49% noncontrolling interest in BCS in February 2013 for a nominal amount, which was treated as
an equity transaction. During the period from February 2013 through December 2013,
100% of BCS results of operations were included in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. During the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, 49% of BCSs results were included within loss attributable to noncontrolling interest
within the consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The total purchase price associated with acquisitions is allocated
to the acquisition date fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess purchase price assigned
to goodwill. In 2011, the Company recorded goodwill of $67,118 related to
the acquisition of PST see Acquisitions above. In 2009, the Company recorded goodwill of $9,118 within the Wiring segment related
to the BCS acquisition. The goodwill related to these acquisitions is not deductible for income tax purposes. The remainder of

$58,521 Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment
or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value-based test. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill
as of the beginning of the fourth quarter. The Company utilized an income approach discounted cash flow method valuation technique
in determining the fair value of the Companys applicable reporting units in the annual impairment test of goodwill. The
discounted cash flow method utilizes a market-derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. The income approach methodology is applied to the reporting
units projected future financial performance. The impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant
estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of impairment charge recorded,
if any. The discounted cash flow method is dependent upon assumption of future sales trends, market conditions and cash flows
of each reporting unit over several years. Actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted.
Other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows.   48

in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded
a goodwill impairment charge of $4,945 within the Wiring reportable segment. The goodwill impairment charge reduced the carrying
value of BCS goodwill to $4,173 and was the result of a decline in business activity due to a reduction in military and defense
related spending by customers since the Companys acquisition of BCS. No impairment was identified in the Wiring segment
for the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012. The Companys accumulated goodwill impairment loss for

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more
likely than not to occur. The Company policy is to provide for uncertain tax positions
and the related interest and penalties based upon management assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to
be sustained upon examination by tax authorities.At December 31, 2013, the Company believes it has appropriately accounted
for any unrecognized tax benefits see Note 5.To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability
for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company effective
tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected. Currency Translation The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the
local currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the period end for
assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for the results of operations. Adjustments resulting
from translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency
transactions are remeasured into the functional currency using translation rates in effect at the time of the transaction, with
the resulting adjustments included on the consolidated statements of operations within other expense, net. These foreign currency
transaction losses, including the impact of hedging activities, were $1,752, $4,275 and $106 for the years ended December 31,
2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products,
net of actual and estimated returns, at the point of passage of title, which is either at the time of shipment or upon customer
receipt based upon the terms of the sale. The Company collects certain taxes and fees on behalf of government agencies and remits
such collections on a periodic basis. The taxes are collected from customers but are not included in net sales. Estimated returns
are based on historical authorized returns. The Company often enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a
given vehicles expected production life. Once such agreements are entered into, it is the Companys obligation to
fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements are subject
to renegotiation, which may affect product pricing. Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold
on the consolidated statements of operations. Product Warranty and Recall Reserves Amounts accrued for product warranty and recall claims are
established based on the Companys best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products
sold as of the balance sheet dates. These accruals are based on several factors including past experience, production changes,
industry developments and various other considerations. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material
claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims beyond the amounts accrued or
beyond what the Company may recover from its suppliers. The current portion of the product warranty and recall reserve is included
as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Product warranty and recall
includes $1,019 and $494 of a long-term liability at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which is included as a component
of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.   50

and $35,263 in years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, or 48%, 48% and 46% of net sales for these respective
periods. Share-Based Compensation At December 31, 2013, the Company had three types of share-based
compensation plans: 1 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, 2 Directors Share Option Plan and 3 the Amended Directors
Restricted Shares Plan. One plan is for employees and two plans are for non-employee directors. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is
madeupofthe Long-Term Incentive Plan that was approved bythe Companyshareholders on September
30, 1997, whichexpired on June 30, 2007, and the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, that was approved
by shareholders on May 17, 2010,and expires on April 24, 2016. Total compensation expense recognized as a component of selling,
general and administrative on the consolidated statements of operations for share-based compensation arrangements was $4,974 4,890 and $4,423 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Of these amounts, $155, $47 and $375 for
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were related to the Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan Phantom
Shares discussed in Note 8. There was no share-based compensation expense capitalized in inventory during 2013, 2012 or
2011. Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial Instruments Financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,
held by the Company include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt, an interest rate
swap, fixed price commodity contracts and foreign currency forward contracts. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable is considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. See Note 9 for fair value disclosures of the Companys financial instruments. Common Shares Held in Treasury The Company accounts for Common Shares held in treasury under
the cost method and includes such shares as a reduction of total shareholders equity. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share was computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding for each respective period. Diluted net income per share was calculated
by dividing net income by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive Common Shares that were outstanding during the periods
presented.   51

outstanding at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These outstanding options were not included in the computation
of diluted net income per share because their respective exercise prices were greater than the average closing market price of
Company Common Shares. There were 663,750, 635,850 and 419,100 performance-based restricted
Common Shares outstanding at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These shares were not included in the computation
of diluted net income per share because all vesting conditions have not been and are not expected to be achieved as of December
31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. These shares may become dilutive based on the Companys ability to meet or exceed future performance
targets. Deferred Finance Costs Deferred finance costs are being amortized over the life of
the related financial instrument using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The 25% discount
to the initial purchasers of the Companys senior secured notes is being accreted using the effective interest rate of 100%
over the life of the senior secured notes. Deferred finance cost amortization and debt discount accretion for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $961, $862 and $875, respectively, and is included as a component of interest expense, net

credit facility the Credit Facility, which permits borrowing up to a maximum level of $100,000. The Company entered
into an Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and a Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement the
Second Amended and Restated Agreement on September 20, 2010 and December 1, 2011, respectively. The Second Amended
and Restated Agreement extended the termination date of the Credit Facility to December 1, 2016, increased the borrowing base
by increasing the sublimit on eligible inventory located at Mexican facilities and made changes to certain covenants relating
to, among other things, guarantees, investments, capital expenditures and permitted indebtedness. The Credit Facility requires
a commitment fee of 0375% on the unused balance. Interest is payable quarterly at either i the higher of the prime rate or
the Federal Funds rate plus 050%, plus a margin of 000% to 025% or ii LIBOR plus a margin of 100% to 175%, depending upon
the Companys undrawn availability, as defined. The available borrowing capacity on the Credit Facility is
based on eligible current assets, as defined. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had undrawn borrowing capacity of approximately
$71,072 and $74,060, respectively, based on eligible current assets. The Credit Facility contains financial performance covenants
which would only constrain the Companys borrowing capacity if our undrawn availability falls below $20,000. However, restrictions
include limits on capital expenditures, operating leases, dividends and investment activities in a negative covenant which limits
investment activities to $15,000 minus certain guarantees and obligations. The Company was in compliance with all Credit Facility covenants

364 The Company recognized a provision for income taxes of $4,226
or 204%, $812 or 178% and $26,105 or 364% of income before income tax for federal, state and foreign income taxes for the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared
to the same period for 2012 was related to the improved financial performance of our Swedish and Brazilian operations. The results
of our U.S. operations do not impact tax expense due to the valuation allowance. However, the income or loss of the U.S. operations
does impact the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for 2013 increased primarily due to a decline in the financial performance
of the U.S. operations. A deferred tax liability of $456 has been recorded related
to earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested related to Brazil. The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes
on the remaining undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because of managements intent and ability to indefinitely
reinvest such earnings. At December 31, 2013 the aggregate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $27,509
The Company may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if these earnings were distributed. It is not practical
to estimate the amount of taxes, if any, that may be payable on these earnings as that estimate depends upon circumstances that
would exist at the time a remittance occurs.   56

$57,711 The Company has concluded based on objective evidence that
at December 31, 2013 and 2012 it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to utilize the remaining
U.S. federal, and certain state and foreign, deferred tax assets before they expire and as such a valuation allowance has been
recorded. The valuation allowance represents the amount of tax benefit related to U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating
losses, credits and other deferred tax assets. The Company has net operating loss carry forwards of $106,637 96,260 and $22,381 for U.S. federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions, respectively. The U.S. federal net operating losses,
if unused, begin to expire in December 31, 2025, the state net operating losses expire at various times and the foreign net operating
losses expire at various times or have indefinite expiration dates. The Company has general business and foreign tax credit carry
forwards of $12,271, $2,005 and $1,908 for U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions respectively. The U.S. federal general
business credits, if unused, begin to expire in December 31, 2021, and the state and foreign tax credits expire at various times.
The Company is required to provide a deferred tax liability corresponding to the difference between the financial reporting basis
which was remeasured to fair value upon the acquisition of an additional 24% of PST in 2011 and the tax basis in the previously
held 50% ownership interest in PST the outside basis difference. This outside basis difference will generally
remain fixed until 1 dividends from the subsidiary exceed the parents share of earnings subsequent to the date it became
a subsidiary or 2 there is a transaction that affects the Companys ownership of PST. During the fourth quarter of 2010 we undertook a secondary
offering. As a result of the secondary offering a substantial change in our ownership occurred and we experienced an ownership
change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. There was no impact to current or deferred income taxes resulting from the ownership
change.   57

$3,452 At December 31, 2013 the Company has classified $639 as a noncurrent
liability and $3,329 as a reduction to non-current deferred income tax assets. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected
to change significantly during the next 12 months. Management is currently unaware of issues under review that could result in
a significant change or a material deviation in this estimate. If the Companys tax positions at December 31, 2013 are
sustained by the taxing authorities in favor of the Company, approximately $3,547 would affect the Companys effective tax
rate. Consistent with historical financial reporting, the Company
has elected to classify interest expense and, if applicable, penalties which could be assessed related to unrecognized tax benefits
as a component of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recognized approximately
$82, $64 and $67 of gross interest and penalties, respectively. The Company has accrued approximately $624 and $706 for the payment
of interest and penalties at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files
income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business
the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The following table summarizes the open tax years

the difference between the fair market value of the Companys Common Shares on the applicable date Measurement Value
and the exercise price of those options that had an exercise price that was less than the Measurement Value. The intrinsic value
of options exercised is the difference between the fair market value of the Companys Common Shares on the date of exercise
and the exercise price. There were no options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The total intrinsic
value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $117. As of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, the aggregate intrinsic
value of both outstanding and exercisable options was $0, $0, and $5, respectively. Restricted Shares The fair value of the non-vested time-based restricted Common
Share awards was calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of issuance. The weighted-average grant-date fair
value of time-based restricted Common Shares granted during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $613, $995 and
$1579, respectively. The fair value of the non-vested performance-based restricted
Common Share awards with a performance condition requiring the Company to obtain certain earnings per share targets was estimated
using the market value of the shares on the date of grant. The fair value of non-vested performance-based restricted Common Share
awards with a market condition requiring the Company to obtain a total shareholder return target relative to a group of peer companies
was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model taking into consideration the probability of achievement using multiple simulations.   60

a weighted-average period of 193 years. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the total fair value of time-based
restricted Common Share awards vested was $2,177, $4,413 and $3,743, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, total unrecognized compensation cost
related to non-vested performance-based restricted Common Share awards granted was $1,873. That cost is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 125 years dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions. As noted above, the Company
has issued and outstanding performance-based restricted Common Share awards that use different performance targets. The awards
that use earnings per share as the performance target will not be expensed until it is probable that the Company will meet the
underlying performance condition. Cash received from option exercises under all share-based payment
arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $0, $0 and $168, respectively. There was no actual tax benefit
realized for the tax deductions from the vesting of restricted Common Shares and option exercises of the share-based payment arrangements
for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. 8. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has certain defined contribution profit sharing
and 401k plans covering substantially all of its employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Company contributions are
generally discretionary. The Companys policy is to fund all benefit costs accrued. For the years ended December 31, 2013,
2012 and 2011, expenses related to these plans amounted to $1,469, $1,527 and $1,801, respectively. The Company provides matching contributions to the Companys
401k plan covering substantially all of its employees in the United States. Long-Term Cash Incentive Plans In March 2009, the Company adopted the Stoneridge, Inc. Long-Term
Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP and granted awards to certain officers and key employees. Awards under the LTCIP provided
recipients with the right to receive cash three years from the date of grant depending on the Companys actual earnings per
share performance for the defined performance period. If the participant voluntarily terminated employment or was discharged for
cause, as defined in the LTCIP, the award would be forfeited. In May 2009, the LTCIP was approved by the Companys shareholders.
At December 31, 2011, the Company had a liability recorded of $2,173, which was paid in March 2012 based on achievement of the
performance goal. As such, no liability remains for this award at December 31, 2012 or 2013. For 2010, the awards under the LTCIP provided recipients with
the right to receive an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of a specified number of Common Shares, without par value,
of the Company Phantom Shares three years from the date of grant depending on the Companys actual earnings
per share performance for each fiscal year of 2011, 2012 and 2013 within the performance period. The Company recorded an accrual
based on the fair market value of the Phantom Shares for an award to be paid in the period earned based on anticipated achievement
of the performance goals. If the participant voluntarily terminates employment or is discharged for cause, as defined in the LTCIP,
the award will be forfeited. At December 31, 2012, the Company recorded a liability of $606 for the awards granted under
the LTCIP which was included on the consolidated balance sheet as component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities.
In February 2013, the 2010 awards were paid based on achievement of the performance goal. As such, no liability remains for this
award at December 31, 2013.   61

Measurements Financial Instruments A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an
obligation to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument. The carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity
of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Companys senior secured notes with a face value of $175,000 fixed
rate debt at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $190,103 and $188,895, respectively, and was determined using market quotes classified
as Level 2 input within the fair value hierarchy. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities On December 31, 2013, the Company had open foreign currency
forward contracts, fixed price commodity contracts and an interest rate swap. These contracts are used solely for hedging and not
for speculative purposes. Management believes that its use of these instruments to reduce risk is in the Companys best interest.
The counterparties to these financial instruments are financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business internationally and therefore
is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as cash flow and fair value
hedges to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations
on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures. The currencies hedged by the Company
during 2013 include the euro and Mexican peso. In certain instances, the foreign currency forward contracts
do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market, with gains and losses recognized in the Companys consolidated
statements of operations as a component of other expense, net. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts offset
some of the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions as follows Euro-denominated and Swedish krona-denominated Foreign Currency
Forward Contracts At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company held a foreign currency
forward contract with an underlying notional amount of $13,335 and $12,643, respectively, to reduce the exposure related to the
Companys euro-denominated intercompany loans. This contract expires in March 2014. During 2012, the Company also held a
foreign currency forward contract to reduce the exposure related to the Companys Swedish krona-denominated intercompany
loans. This contract expired on November 30, 2012. The euro-denominated and Swedish krona-denominated foreign currency forward
contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized
a loss of $638 and $492, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other expense, net related
to the euro- and Swedish krona-denominated contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recognized a $225 gain
related to foreign currency forward contracts. Mexican peso-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
Cash Flow Hedge The Company holds Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency
contracts with notional amounts at December 31, 2013 totaling $45,000 which expire ratably on a monthly basis from January 2014
through December 2014. The Company held Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency contracts with notional amounts at December 31,
2012 of 36,500 which expired ratably on a monthly basis from January 2013 through December 2013.   62
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated These contracts were executed to hedge forecasted transactions
and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. As such, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported
in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The cash flow hedges
are highly effective and the Company expects them to remain highly effective in future periods. The effectiveness of the transactions
has been and will be measured on an ongoing basis using regression analysis and forecasted future Mexican peso purchases. Commodity Price Risk - Cash Flow Hedge To mitigate the risk of future price volatility and, consequently,
fluctuations in gross margins, the Company entered into fixed price commodity contracts with a financial institution to fix the
cost of a portion of the Companys copper purchases as copper is a significant raw material. The Company has fixed price commodity contracts at December
31, 2013 with an aggregate notional amount of 1,582 pounds, which expire on a monthly basis over the period from January through
December 2014, compared to an aggregate notional amount of 2,436 pounds at December 31, 2012. All of these contracts represent a portion of the Companys
forecasted copper purchases. These contracts were executed to hedge a portion of forecasted transactions and the contracts are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The unrealized gain or loss for the effective portion of the hedges is deferred and reported
in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss while the ineffective
portion, if any, is reported in the consolidated statements of operations. The effectiveness of the transactions is measured on
an ongoing basis using regression analysis and forecasted future copper purchases. Based upon the results of the regression analysis,
the Company has concluded that these cash flow hedges are highly effective. Interest Rate Risk - Fair Value Hedge The Company has a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreement
the Swap with a notional amount of $45,000 to hedge its exposure to fair value fluctuations on a portion of its
senior secured notes. The Swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed interest rate obligation under the Companys
$175,000 95% senior secured notes due October 15, 2017. The critical terms of the Swap are aligned with the terms of the senior
secured notes, including maturity of October 15, 2017, resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness. The unrealized gain or loss for the
effective portion of the hedge is deferred and reported in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability,
as applicable, with the offset to the carrying value of the senior secured notes. Under the Swap, the Company pays a variable interest rate equal

Swap requires semi-annual settlements on April 15 and October 15. The difference between amounts to be received and paid under
the Swap is recognized as a component of interest expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. The Swap reduced interest expense by $810, $736 and $473 for
the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.   63

of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement
date. The Company did not have any fair value estimates using Level 1 inputs at December 31, 2013 or 2012. BFair values estimated using Level 2 inputs, other than
quoted prices, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly and include among other things, quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active or inactive as well as inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable. For forward currency, fixed price commodity and interest rate swap contracts, inputs include foreign currency
exchange rates, commodity indexes and the six-month forward LIBOR. CFair values estimated using Level 3 inputs consist of
significant unobservable inputs. The Company did not have any fair value estimates using Level 3 inputs at December 31, 2013 or
2012. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded a
fair value adjustment of $4,945 related to the BCS goodwill. The Company utilized Level 3 inputs to estimate the fair value adjustment
for nonfinancial assets. For additional information, see the discussion of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Note 2. No adjustments
to fair value were required for nonfinancial assets for the years ended December 31, 2013 or 2012. 10. Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to
various claims and legal proceedings, workers compensation and product liability disputes. The Company is of the opinion
that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse affect on the results of operations, cash flows
or the financial position of the Company. As a result of environmental studies performed at the Companys
former facility located in Sarasota, Florida, the Company became aware of soil and groundwater contamination at the Company site.
The Company engaged an environmental engineering consultant to assess the level of contamination and to develop a remediation and
monitoring plan for the site. Soil remediation at the site was completed during the year ended December 31, 2010. Ground water
remediation will begin in the first quarter of 2014, in accordance with a remedial action plan approved by the Florida Department
of Environmental Protection. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, environmental remediation costs incurred were immaterial.
At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had accrued an undiscounted liability of $944 and $1,340, respectively, related to future
remediation. The decrease in the accrual is related to changes in assumptions used in the remedial action plan. At December 31,
2013 and 2012, $683 and $733, respectively, were recorded as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheets while the remaining amounts were recorded as a component of other long-term liabilities. A majority
of the costs associated with the recorded liability will be incurred at the start of the groundwater remediation, with the balance
relating to monitoring costs to be incurred over multiple years. The recorded liability is based on assumptions in the remedial
action plan. In December 2011, the Company sold the Sarasota facility and related property. However, the liability to remediate
the site contamination remains the responsibility of the Company. Due to the ongoing site remediation, the closing terms of the
sale agreement included a requirement for the Company to maintain a $2,000 letter of credit for the benefit of the buyer.   65
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated On May 24, 2013, the State Revenue Services of So Paulo
issued a tax deficiency notice against PST, our 74% owned consolidated subsidiary, claiming that the vehicle tracking and monitoring
services it provides should be classified as communication services, and therefore subject to the State Value Added Tax 
ICMS. The State Revenue Services assessment imposed the 250% ICMS tax on all revenues of PST related to the vehicle tracking and
monitoring services during the period from January 2009 through December 2010. The Brazilian real R$ and U.S.
dollar equivalent $ of the aggregate tax assessment is approximately R$92,500 $39,500 which is comprised of Value
Added Tax ICMS of R$13,200 $5,600, interest of R$11,400 $4,900 and penalties of R$67,900 $29,000. The Companys vehicle tracking and monitoring services
are non-communication services, as defined under Brazilian tax law, subject to the municipal ISS tax, not communication services
subject to state ICMS tax as claimed by the State Revenue Services of So Paulo. PST has, and will continue to collect the
municipal ISS tax on the vehicle tracking and monitoring services in compliance with Brazilian tax law and will defend its tax
position. PST has received a legal opinion that the merits of the case are favorable to PST, determining among other things that
the imposition on the subsidiary of the State ICMS by the State Revenue Services of So Paulo is not in accordance with
the Brazilian tax code. Management believes, based on the legal opinion of PSTs Brazilian legal counsel and the results
of the Brazil Administrative Court ruling in favor of another vehicle tracking and monitoring company related to the tax deficiency
notice it received, the likelihood of loss is not probable although it may take years to resolve. As a result of the above,
as of December 31, 2013, no provision has been made with respect to this tax assessment. An unfavorable judgment on this
issue for the years assessed and for subsequent years could result in significant costs to PST and adversely affect its results
of operations. In addition, PST has civil, labor and tributary contingencies
for which the likelihood of loss is deemed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, by its legal advisors. As a result, no
provision has been made with respect to these contingencies, which amount to $11,469 and $11,925 at December, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
An unfavorable outcome on this issue could result in significant cost to PST and adversely affect its results of operations. 11. Restructuring On October 29, 2007, the Company announced restructuring initiatives
to improve manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at its Sarasota, Florida Control Devices
reportable segment and Mitcheldean, United Kingdom Electronics reportable segment locations. During 2008 and 2009, in response
to the depressed conditions in the North American and European commercial and automotive vehicle markets, the Company continued
and expanded the restructuring initiatives in the Control Devices and Electronics reportable segments. While the initiatives were
completed in 2009 in regards to the Control Devices reportable segment, in 2010 the Company continued restructuring initiatives
within the Electronics reportable segment and recorded amounts related to its cancelled property lease in Mitcheldean, United Kingdom.
During the third quarter of 2012, the Company finalized a settlement agreement to modify the terms of and the obligation associated
with the property consistent with previous estimates. As a result of the restructuring plan approved on October 29,
2007, the manufacturing facility located in Sarasota, Florida was closed in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the
Company sold the facility and recognized a gain of $95 as a component of selling, general and administrative expense. In connection with the Electronics segment restructuring initiative,
the Company recorded lease related restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 of $469 and $256, respectively,
as part of selling, general and administrative expense. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the only remaining restructuring related
accrual relates to the cancelled property lease in Mitcheldean, United Kingdom, for which the Company has accrued $780 and $765,
respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets of which $427 and $419, respectively, is a component of other long-term liabilities.   66

incurred and paid business realignment charges of $1,646 for the year ended December 31, 2012, of which $729 was recorded in cost
of goods sold with the remainder recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The charges consist primarily of severance
costs related to workforce reductions. There were no restructuring expenses related to the PST segment during the year ended December
31, 2013. Contract termination costs represent costs associated with long-term
lease obligations that were cancelled as part of the restructuring initiatives. 12. Segment Reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
that are evaluated regularly by the Companys chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance. The Companys chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer. The Company has four reportable segments: Control Devices, Electronics,
Wiring and PST which also represents its operating segments. The Control Devices reportable segment produces sensors, switches,
valves and actuators. The Electronics reportable segment produces electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units and
driver information systems. The Wiring reportable segment produces electrical power and signal distribution systems, primarily
wiring harnesses and connectors and instrument panel assemblies. The PST reportable segment specializes in the design, manufacture
and sale of electronic vehicle security alarms, convenience accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in-vehicle
audio and video devices. The accounting policies of the Companys reportable segments
are the same as those described in Note 2. The Companys management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments
based primarily on revenues from external customers, capital expenditures and income before income taxes. Inter-segment sales are
accounted for on terms similar to those to third parties and are eliminated upon consolidation.   67
