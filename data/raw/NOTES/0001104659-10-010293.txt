48 Table of Contents Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Cornell
Companies,Inc. In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, of changes in
equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Cornell Companies,Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December31, 2009 and
2008, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2009 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As
discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for non-controlling interests beginning on
January 1, 2009. Also, as discussed in Note10 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
uncertainty in income taxes effective January1, 2007. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.
A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION
OF THE BUSINESS Cornell Companies,Inc. collectively with its
subsidiaries and consolidated special purpose entities, unless the context
requires otherwise, Cornell, the Company, we, us, or our,, a
Delaware corporation, provides integrated development, design, construction and
management of facilities to governmental agencies within three operating
segments: 1Adult Secure Services; 2Abraxas Youth and Family
Services and 3Adult Community-Based Services. 2. SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and our
activities relative to a financing of operating facilities. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Non-controlling
interest in consolidated special purpose entities represents equity that other
investors have contributed to the special purpose entities. Non-controlling
interest is adjusted for income and losses allocable to the other owners of the
special purpose entities. Cash and Cash
Equivalents We consider all highly liquid unrestricted
investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. We invest our available cash balances in short term money market
accounts, short term certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Accounts
Receivable and Related Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We extend credit to the governmental agencies and
other parties with which we contract in the normal course of business. We
regularly review our outstanding receivables and historical collection
experience, and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful
accounts. In evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts, we
make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments,
economic events and other factors. As the financial condition of these parties
change, circumstances develop or additional information becomes available,
adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may occur. If, after
reasonable collection efforts have been made, a receivable is determined to be
uncollectible, it will be written off. The
changes in allowance for doubtful accounts associated with trade accounts
receivable for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are as

Bond Fund Payment
Account and other Restricted Assets Restricted assets at December31, 2009 and 2008
include approximately $261 million and $238 million, respectively, of
Municipal Correctional Finance, LPs MCF restricted cash accounts. MCFs
restricted accounts primarily consist of a debt service reserve fund used to
segregate rental payment funds from us to MCF for MCFs semi-annual bond
interest and annual bond principal payments. MCFs funds are typically invested
in short term certificates of deposit, money market accounts and commercial
paper. They will be used to fund a portion of MCFs debt service due in the
coming year. At certain facilities, we maintain bank accounts for
restricted cash belonging to facility residents, commissary operations and
equipment replacement funds used in certain state programs. Restricted
assets at December31, 2009 and 2008 include approximately $38 million
and $34 million, respectively, for these accounts. A corresponding liability
for these obligations is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying
financial statements. 54 Table of
Contents Property and
Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Ordinary maintenance and repair costs are expensed, while renewal and
betterment costs are capitalized. Buildings and improvements are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives of 30 to 50 years using the straight-line
method. Prepaid facility use cost, which resulted from the July1996
acquisition of the Big Spring Correctional Center and the December1999
transfer of ownership of the Great Plains Correctional Facility to a leasehold
interest, is being amortized over 50 years using the straight-line method.
Furniture and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives of 3
to 10 years using the straight-line method. Amortization of
leasehold improvements including those funded by landlord incentives or
allowances is recorded using the straight-line method based upon the shorter
of the economic life of the asset or the term of the respective lease. Landlord
incentives or allowances under operating leases are recorded as deferred rent
and amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term. See Note 7 to
the consolidated financial statements for further details concerning our
property and equipment balances at December31, 2009 and 2008. We review our long-lived assets including our
facilities at a facility-by-facility level for impairment at least annually or
when changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicates that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable.Authoritative guidance
requires that long-lived assets to be held and used recognize an impairment
loss only if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable
from its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and to measure an impairment
loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the
asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale are recorded at the lower of their
carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs. We estimate
projections of undiscounted cash flows, and also fair value, based upon the best
information available, which may include expected future discounted cash flows
to be produced by the asset and/or available market prices. Factors that
significantly influence estimated future cash flows include the periods and
levels of occupancy for the facility, expected per diem or reimbursement rates,
assumptions regarding the levels of staffing, services and future operating and
capital expenditures necessary to generate forecasted revenues, related costs
for these activities and future rate of increases or decreases associated with
these factors. Information typically utilized will also include relevant terms
of existing contracts for similar services and customers, market knowledge of
customer demand both present and anticipated and related pricing, market
competitors, and our historical experience as to areas including customer
requirements, contract terms, operating requirements/costs, occupancy trends,
etc. We may also consider the results of any appraisals if a fair value is
necessary. Estimates for factors such as per diem or reimbursement rates may be
highly subjective, particularly in circumstances where there is no current
operating contract in place and changes in the assumptions and estimates could
result in the recognition of impairment charges. Capitalized
Interest We capitalize interest on facilities while under
construction. We capitalized interest of approximately $07 million in the year
ended December31, 2009 related to the 700 bed facility expansion project
at the D. Ray James Prison. Interest capitalized for the year ended December31,
2008 was approximately $29 million and related to the expansion projects at
the D. Ray James Prison and the Great Plains Correctional Facility. Interest
capitalized for the year ended December31, 2007 was approximately $12
million and related to the expansion projects at the Big Spring Correctional
Center, the D. Ray James Prison and the Great Plains Correctional Facility. Debt Service
Reserve Fund The debt service reserve fund was established at the
closing of MCFs bond issuance and is to be used solely for MCFs debt service
to the extent that funds in MCFs debt service accounts are insufficient. The
debt service reserve fund is invested principally in short term commercial
instruments. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Intangible Assets We
evaluate the carrying value of our existing intangibles which are the result
of prior acquisitions both business facilities and operating contracts for
impairment annually or when changes in circumstances or a triggering event
indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. We have
evaluated the carrying value of our existing intangibles and concluded there
has not been impairment to the carrying value of our existing intangibles as of
December31, 2009. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for
further details concerning our intangible assets. 55 Table of Contents Deferred Costs Costs incurred related to obtaining debt financing
are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related indebtedness. At December31,
2009 and 2008, we had net deferred debt issuance costs of approximately $65
million and $76 million, respectively. Revenue
Recognition Substantially all of our revenues are derived from
contracts with federal, state and local governmental agencies, which pay either
per diem rates based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the
period, on a take-or-pay basis, management fee basis, cost-plus reimbursement
or fee-for-service basis. Revenues are recognized as services are provided
under our established contractual agreements to the extent collection is
considered probable. Pre-opening and
Start-up Expenses Pre-opening and start-up expenses are charged to
operations as incurred. Pre-opening and start-up expenses include payroll,
benefits, training and other operating costs during periods prior to opening a
new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is
ramping up. These costs vary by contract. Newly opened facilities are staffed
according to applicable regulatory or contractual requirements when we begin
receiving offenders or clients. Offenders or clients are typically assigned to
a newly opened facility on a phased-in basis over a one-to-six month period.
Our start-up period for new juvenile operations is 12 months from the date we
begin recognizing revenue unless break-even occupancy is achieved before then.
Our start-up period for new adult operations is nine months from the date we
begin recognizing revenue unless break-even occupancy is achieved before then. Proposal Costs We incur various expenses in conjunction with our
participation in the proposal process with government agencies for their
procurement of our services. These costs include such items as payroll and
related employee benefits and taxes, research, consulting, legal and
reproduction costs and are expensed in the periods incurred and are included in
general and administrative expenses. Operating and
General and Administrative Expenses We incur various expenses within the normal course
of our business. Included in operating expenses are direct expense items such
as personnel/employee benefits, resident/inmate care expenses and
building/utility costs pertaining to the operations of our facilities and
programs. Included in general and administrative expenses are expense items
such as personnel/employee benefits, professional services and building/utility
costs pertaining to our corporate activities. Business
Concentration Contracts with federal, state and local governmental
agencies account for nearly all of our revenues. The loss of, or a significant
decrease in, business from one or more of these governmental agencies could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. For the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 347 342% and 326%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues were derived from
contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons BOP, the only customer
constituting more than 100% of our revenues during each of these periods. Self Insurance
Reserves We
maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations.
We retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and
retention under self-insurance programs. These programs include workers
compensation and employers liability, general liability and professional
liability, directors and officers liability and medical and dental insurance.
We maintain deductibles under these programs in amounts ranging from $05
million to $10 million. We maintain excess loss insurance for amounts
exceeding our deductibles. We
regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide
for these losses through insurance reserves. These reserves are influenced by
rising costs of health care and other costs, increases in claims, time lags in
claim information and levels of insurance coverage carried. As claims develop
and additional information becomes available to us, adjustments to the related
loss reserves may occur. Our estimated reserves for workers compensation claims
incorporate the use of a 3% discount factor. Our reserves for medical and
workers compensation claims are subject to change based on our estimate of the
number and magnitude of claims to be incurred. 56 Table of Contents Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases based on enacted tax rates. In
providing for deferred taxes, we consider tax regulations expected to be in effect
when differences reverse, estimates of future taxable income and available tax
planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to
implement tax planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of
tax assets and liabilities may occur. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements. Earnings Per
Share Basic
earnings per share EPS are computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
period. Potentially dilutive common
shares include the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options and
restricted common stock granted under our various option and other incentive
plans. As of January1, 2009, in
accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASU 260-10,
instruments with nonforfeitable dividend rights granted in share-based payment
transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need
to be included in the earnings allocation in computing EPS under the two-class
method. For our fiscal year beginning January1,
2009, since our restricted common stock grants including both vested and those
unvested due to either time or performance requirements convey nonforfeitable
rights to dividends while outstanding, they are included in both basic and
fully diluted EPS calculations. All
prior-period EPS data has been adjusted retrospectively to conform to the
calculation of EPS. For
the year ended December31, 2009, there were 101,700 shares $2216
average price of stock options that were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because to do so would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December31, 2008,
there were 64,200 shares $2324 average price of stock options that were not
included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would have been
anti-dilutive. For the year ended December31,
2007, there were 19,200 shares $2456 average price of stock options that
were not included in computation of diluted EPS because to do so would have
been anti-dilutive. The following
table summarizes the calculation of income and the weighted average common
shares and common equivalent shares outstanding for purposes of the computation

Financial
Instruments The
carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, investment securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable
and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of
these financial instruments. At December31, 2009, the carrying amount of
consolidated debt was $3033 million, and the estimated fair value was $3091
million. At December31, 2008, the carrying amount was $3205 million, and
the estimated fair value was $3080 million. The estimated fair value of
long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market prices or discounted cash
flow analysis for the same or similar issues. 57 Table of Contents Derivative
Instruments Derivatives are recognized at fair value in the
consolidated balance sheet. For
derivatives designated as hedging the exposure to changes in fair value of an
asset or liability, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings together with
the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item.
For derivatives designated as hedging the exposure of variable cash
flows, the effective portion is reported in other comprehensive income and
subsequently reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects
earnings. For derivatives not designated
or de-designated as a hedging instrument, the gain or loss is recognized in
earnings in the period of change. Use of Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect our
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on
an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the information
available. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. The significant estimates that we make in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the allowance for
doubtful accounts, accruals for insurance and legal claims, valuation allowance
for deferred tax accounts, the realizability of long-lived tangible and
intangible assets and the fair value of financial instruments. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the
prior period financial statements contained herein to conform to current year
presentation. 3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We have an employee stock purchase plan ESPP under which
employees can make contributions to purchase our common stock. Participation in
the plan is elected annually by employees. The plan year begins on January1st
the Beginning Date and ends on December31st the Ending Date.
Purchases of common stock are made at the end of the year using the lower of
the fair market value on either the Beginning Date or Ending Date, less a 15%
discount. Under
authoritative guidance our employee-stock purchase plan is considered to be a
compensatory ESPP, and therefore, we recognize compensation expense over the
requisite service period for grants made under the ESPP. Compensation expense
of approximately $01 million and $009 million was recognized in each of the
years ended December31, 2009 and 2008. Our stock incentive plans
provide for the granting of stock options both incentive stock options and
nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares
and other stock-based awards to officers, directors and employees of the
Company. Grants of stock options made to date under these plans vest over
periods up to seven years after the date of grant and expire no more than 10
years after grant. At December31,
2008, 184,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding were subject to
performance-based vesting criteria 32,500 of these restricted shares were
considered market-based restricted stock. There were also 52,700 stock options
outstanding subject to performance-based vesting criteria. We recognized $11
million of expense associated with these shares of restricted stock and stock
options during the year ended December31, 2008. At December31,
2009, 314,227 shares of restricted stock were outstanding subject to
performance-based vesting criteria 32,500 of these restricted shares were
considered market-based restricted stock. There were also 6,260 stock options
outstanding subject to performance-based vesting criteria. We recognized $13
million of expense associated with these shares of restricted stock and stock
options during the year ended December31, 2009. The amounts above relate to the impact of recognizing
compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock.
Compensation expense related to stock options 6,260 shares and restricted
stock 281,727 shares that vest based upon performance conditions is not
recorded for such performance-based awards until it has been deemed probable
that the related performance targets allowing the vesting of these options and
restricted stock will be met. We are required to periodically re-assess the
probability that these performance-based awards will vest and begin to record
expense at that point in time. During the year ended December31, 2009 it
was deemed probable that certain performance targets pertaining to certain
restricted stock and stock options would be achieved by their vesting date.
Accordingly, compensation expense of approximately $11 million was recognized
in the year ended December31, 2009 related to these performance-based
awards. 58 Table of Contents We recognize expense for our stock-based
compensation over the vesting period, or in the case of performance-based
awards, during the service period for which the performance target becomes
probable of being met, which represents the period in which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award. We recognize compensation
expense for stock-based awards immediately if the award has immediate vesting. Assumptions The
fair values for the significant stock-based awards granted during the years
ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions

The
expected volatility of stock assumption was derived by referring to changes in
the Companys historical common stock prices over a timeframe similar to that
of the expected life of the award. We do not believe that future stock
volatility will significantly differ from historical stock volatility.
Estimated forfeiture rates are derived from historical forfeiture patterns. We
believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of forfeitures
currently available. Generally
we utilized the simplified method for plain vanilla options to estimate the
expected term of options granted during the periods noted where
appropriate. For those grants during
these periods wherein we had sufficient historical or impartial data to better
estimate the expected term, we have done so. 59 Table of Contents Stock-based

The
total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $02 million, $05 million and $15 million,
respectively. Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were
approximately $03 million, $04 million and $25 million for the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
recognized $05 million of expense associated with time-based stock options
during the year ended December31, 2009. As of December31, 2009,
approximately $004 million of estimated expense with respect to nonvested
stock-based awards had yet to be recognized and will be amortized into expense
over the employees estimated remaining weighted average service period of
approximately 4 months. The

MEASUREMENTS On
January1, 2008, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard for fair
value measurements of financial assets and liabilities which did not have a
material financial impact on our consolidated results of operations or
financial condition. On January1,
2009, we adopted the provisions of this new accounting pronouncement for
applying fair value to non-financial assets, liabilities and transactions on a
non-recurring basis. Adoption of the
provisions for the fair value measurements on a non-recurring basis did not
have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. As
defined in this accounting standard, fair value is the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price. Additionally, this pronouncement requires
disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.
Additionally, it requires that fair value measurements be classified and
disclosed in one of the following categories 
Level
1
Unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date
for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level
2
Quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability; and
Level
3
Prices
or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the
fair value measurement and unobservable i.e., supported by little or no
market activity.
As
required, financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest
level of input that is significant for the fair value measurement. The following table summarizes the valuation
of our financial assets and liabilities by pricing levels as of December31,
2009

The
corporate bonds and money market funds are carried in debt service fund and
other restricted assets and the debt service reserve fund in the accompanying
balance sheet. The fair value measurements for corporate bonds and money-market
funds are based upon the quoted price for similar assets in markets that are
not active, multiplied by the number of shares owned, exclusive of any
transaction costs and without any adjustments to reflect discounts that may be
applied to selling a large block of securities at one time. We do not believe that the changes in fair
value of these assets will materially differ from the amounts that could be
realized upon settlement or that the changes in fair value will have a material
effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. This
accounting standard requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
balances for fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs. We had no such
assets or liabilities which were measured at fair value on a recurring basis
using significant unobservable inputs level 3 during the year ended December31,
2009. We evaluated our long-lived assets
for impairment using internally developed, unobservable inputs Level 3 inputs
in the fair value hierarchy of fair value accounting based on the projected
cash flows of our idle facilities. Refer
to Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting
for Long-Lived Assets for a discussion concerning the facilities we evaluated
for impairment in the year ended December31, 2009. 5. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December2007,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB revised the authoritative
guidance for business combinations which establishes principles and
requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination 1recognizes
and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, 2recognizes
and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
bargain purchase and 3determines what information to disclose to enable
users of the financial statements to evaluate the 62 Table of Contents nature and financial
effects of the business combination. This guidance applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the
beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15,
2008. Our adoption of this revised
guidance on January1, 2009 did not have any impact on our consolidated
results of operations or financial condition as we did not have any business
combination activity in the year ended December31, 2009. Additionally,
the FASB amended the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or
extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized
intangible asset to improve the consistency between the useful life of a
recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to
measure the fair value of the asset under the current guidance concerning
business combinations and other U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. This new guidance is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Our adoption of the new guidance on January1,
2009 did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In December2007,
the FASB issued authoritative guidance which established new accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The new
guidance requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority
interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from
the parents equity. The amount of net
income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. This guidance clarifies that changes in a
parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in
deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling
financial interest. In addition, it requires
that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will
be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the
deconsolidation date. Additionally,
there are expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the
parent and its noncontrolling interest.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008. We adopted the new guidance on January1,
2009 and applied the provisions to our 2009 financial statements and
retroactively to all prior periods presented. In March2008,
the FASB issued new authoritative guidance to improve financial reporting about
derivatives and hedging activities by requiring enhanced qualitative and
quantitative disclosures regarding derivative instruments, gains and losses on
such instruments and their effects on an entitys financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. Our adoption
of this new guidance on January1, 2009 did not have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May2008,
the FASB issued new authoritative guidance which establishes general standards
of accounting and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before the financial statements are issued.
This guidance sets forth 1the period after the balance sheet
date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may
occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, 2the
circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions
occurring after the balance sheet date and 3the disclosures an entity
should make about such events or transactions.
Management has performed a review of our subsequent events and
transactions through February26, 2010, which is the date the financial
statements are issued. In June2009, the
FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification Codification. The
Codification became the single source for all authoritative generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied for
financial statements issued for periods ending after September15, 2009.
The Codification does not change GAAP and did not have an affect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 6. FUTURE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS In
January2010, the FASB issued an amendment to the disclosure requirement
related to Fair Value Measurements. The
amendment requires new disclosures related to transfers in and out of Levels 1
and 2 and activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. A reporting entity is required to disclose
separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level
2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers. Additionally, in the reconciliation for fair
value measurements in Level 3, a reporting entity must present separately
information about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis
rather than a net number. The new
disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases,
sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3
fair value measurements. Those
disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We do not anticipate that our adoption of
this amendment will have a material affect on our financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. In June2009,
the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for
transfers of financial 63 Table of Contents assets. This amendment applies to the financial
reporting of a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on an
entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows; and a
transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial
assets. It eliminates 1the
exceptions for qualifying special-purpose entities from the consolidation
guidance and 2the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain
mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the
transferred financial assets. The
provisions of this amendment must be applied as of the beginning of each
reporting entitys first annual reporting period that begins after November15,
2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for
interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. The requirements in the amendment must be
applied to transfers occurring on or after the effective date. We are currently
evaluating the impact, if any, that such requirements may have on our financial
statements once adopted. In June2009, the FASB also issued an amendment to the accounting
and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities
VIEs. This amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative
analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. The amendment also requires an enterprise to
continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a VIE. Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced
disclosures about an enterprises involvement with VIEs and any significant
change in risk exposure due to that involvement, as well as how its involvement
with VIEs impacts the enterprises financial statements. Finally, an enterprise will be required to
disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not
to consolidate a VIE. This amendment is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2009. Earlier application is prohibited.
We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this amendment may have on
our financial statements once adopted. 7. PROPERTY

The
most subjective estimates made in our impairment analysis for 2009 related to
Baker Correctional Baker and the Hector Garza Residential Treatment Center
Hector Garza which are components of building and improvements,
particularly with respect to estimated timing of occupancy at Baker and
resident mix at Hector Garza. The approximate carrying values at December31,
2009 for Baker and Hector Garza were $28 million and $39 million,
respectively. The estimated undiscounted future cash flow values exceeded the
carrying values noted for the facilities, and Hector Garza had operating contracts
in place. If the underlying assumptions for the deemed subjective estimates in
the 2009 analyses were adjusted to reflect reasonable likely changes the
undiscounted cash flows would still exceed the carrying value of the assets
assessed for impairment. The
most subjective estimates made in our impairment analysis for 2008 related to
Cornell Abraxas 1 and Hector Garza, particularly with respect to estimated
occupancy. The approximate carrying values at December31, 2008 for
Cornell Abraxas 1 and Hector Garza were $104 million and $40 million,
respectively. The estimated undiscounted future cash flow values exceeded the
carrying values noted for the facilities, and all facilities had operating
contracts in place. During 2009, there were no significant events that caused
us to believe that an impairment of these facilities had occurred. As a result
of strengthened operating performance primarily due to increases in and
stabilization of its occupancy in 2009, the assumptions included in the
impairment analysis for Cornell Abraxas 1 became less subjective for the 2009
analysis. In conjunction with our
review of certain of our long-lived assets based on estimated market values
associated with these assets, we determined that our carrying value for a currently
vacant site of land was not fully recoverable and exceeded its fair value and,
as a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $03 million in the year ended
December31, 2008 none in the years ended December31, 2009 and
2007. This charge is reflected in
operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. 64 Table of Contents 8. INTANGIBLE

In 2008, we
recorded a reduction to goodwill as a result of the final release of amounts
previously placed in escrow related to the acquisition of Correctional Systems,Inc.
CSI in April2005. At December31,
2009, we performed our annual impairment test and concluded that there was no
impairment to our existing goodwill. Amortization
expense for our acquired contract value was approximately $05 million for the
year ended December31, 2009, $13 million for the year ended December31,
2008 and $11 million for the year ended December31, 2007. Amortization
expense for our acquired contract value is expected to be approximately $05
million for each of the years ended December31, 2010 and 2011 and
approximately $01 million for the year ended December31, 2012. Amortization expense for
our non-compete agreements was approximately $06 million, $08 million and
$13 million for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. At December31, 2009,

TAXES Effective
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted a new accounting standard related to
uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of adoption, we recorded a cumulative
effect adjustment of approximately $03million which increased retained
earnings at January1, 2007. As of December31,
2009 and December31, 2008, we had unrecognized tax benefits in the amount
of $26 million and $25 million, respectively. If these unrecognized tax
benefits were recognized in future periods, approximately $11 million and $09
million would reduce our income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the
years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending

interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are
classified as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and totaled
approximately $01 million in the year ended December31, 2009 and $01
million in the year ended December31, 2008. Accrued interest and penalties were
approximately $02 million at December31, 2009 and 2008. We are
subject to income tax in the United States and many of the individual states we
operate in. We currently have
significant operations in Texas, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Georgia,
Illinois and Pennsylvania. State income
tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five
years after filing. The state impact of
any changes made to the federal return remains subject to examination by
various states for a period up to one year after formal notification to the
state. We are open to United States
Federal Income Tax examinations for the tax years December31, 2005
through December2008. The audit of our 2006 federal income tax
return by the Internal Revenue Service was recently concluded without material
findings. We do
not anticipate a significant change in the balance of our unrecognized tax
benefits within the next 12 months. 66 Table of Contents The

As of December31, 2009
we have net operating losses for state income taxes of approximately $386
million on which we have provided a valuation allowance of $39 million. Our
tax returns are subject to periodic audit by the various jurisdictions in which
we operate. These audits can result in adjustments of taxes due or adjustments
of the NOLs which are available to offset future taxable income. Valuation
allowances of $39 million have been established for uncertainties in realizing
the benefit of certain state income tax loss carryforwards. For the years ended
December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, changes in our state operating loss
carryforwards decreased/increased our valuation allowance by $09 million 09 million and $04 million, respectively. In assessing the realizability
of carryforwards, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The valuation
allowance will be adjusted in the periods that we determine it is more likely
than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized. We
have federal and state income tax net operating loss carryforwards of $00
million and $386 million which will expire at various dates from 2011 through
2034. Such net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2011 and 2034 as

Long-Term Credit Facilities. Our Amended Credit
Facility provides for borrowings up to $1000 million including letters of
credit and matures in December2011.
At our election, outstanding borrowings bear interest at either the
LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 150% to 225% or a rate which ranges
from 000% to 075% above the applicable prime rate. The applicable margins are
subject to adjustments based on our total leverage ratio. The available commitment under our Amended
Credit Facility was approximately $179 million at December31, 2009. We had outstanding borrowings under our
Amended Credit Facility of $700 million and we had outstanding letters of
credit of approximately $121 million at December31, 2009. Subject to certain requirements, we have the
right to increase the commitments under our Amended Credit Facility up to
$1500 million, although the indenture for our Senior Notes limits our ability,
subject to certain conditions, to expand the Amended Credit Facility beyond
$1000 million. We can provide no
assurance that all of the banks that have made commitments to us under our
Amended Credit Facility would be willing to participate in an expansion to the
Amended Credit Facility should we desire to do so. The Amended Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including
the assets and stock of all of our subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Facility is
not collateralized by the assets of MCF. Our Amended Credit Facility contains
certain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to
engage in certain activities. Our
ability to borrow under the Amended Credit Facility is subject to compliance
with certain financial covenants, including bank leverage, total leverage and
fixed charge coverage ratios. At December31,
2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Our Amended Credit Facility includes other
restrictions that, among other things, limit our ability to: incur
indebtedness; grant liens; engage in mergers, consolidations and liquidations;
make investments, restricted payments and asset dispositions; enter into
transactions with affiliates; and engage in sale/leaseback transactions. 68 Table of Contents MCF is obligated for the outstanding
balance of its 847% Taxable Revenue Bonds, Series2001. The bonds bear interest at a rate of 847%
per annum and are payable in semi-annual installments of interest and annual
installments of principal. All unpaid
principal and accrued interest on the bonds is due on the earlier of August1,
2016 maturity or as noted under the bond documents. The bonds are limited, nonrecourse
obligations of MCF and are collateralized by the property and equipment, bond
reserves, assignment of subleases and substantially all assets related to the
facilities included in the 2001 Sale and Leaseback Transaction in which we
sold eleven facilities to MCF as identified in Item 1 Facilities of this
report. The bonds are not guaranteed
by Cornell. In June2004, we issued $1120 million in principal of 1075%
Senior Notes the Senior Notes due July1, 2012. The Senior Notes are unsecured senior
indebtedness and are guaranteed by all of our existing and future subsidiaries
collectively, the Guarantors. The
Senior Notes are not guaranteed by MCF the Non-Guarantor. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable
semi-annually on January1 and July1 of each year, commencing January1,
2005. On or after July1, 2008, we
were able to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes at the redemption
prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount listed below, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Senior Notes redeemed, to the
applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period
commencing on July1 of each of the remaining years indicated below.

As
the Senior Notes are redeemable at our option subject to the requirements
noted we anticipate we will monitor the capital markets and continue to assess
our capital needs and our capital structure, including a potential refinancing
of the Senior Notes. Upon
the occurrence of specified change of control events, unless we have exercised
our option to redeem all the Senior Notes as described above, each holder will
have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holders
Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount of the notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on the Senior Notes repurchased, to the applicable date of purchase. The Senior Notes were issued under an
indenture which limits our ability and the ability of our Guarantors to, among
other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions,
make other restricted payments and investments, create liens, incur
restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to pay dividends or other
payments to us, enter into transactions with affiliates, and engage in mergers,
consolidations and certain sales of assets. Scheduled maturities of our consolidated long-term

AND CONTINGENCIES Financial
Guarantees During the normal course of business, we enter into
contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide
general indemnifications. Our maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against us that
have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, we believe the risk of
loss to be remote. 69 Table of Contents Operating Leases We lease office space, certain facilities and
furniture and equipment under long-term operating leases. Rent expense for all
operating leases for the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
approximately $109 million, $102 million and $104 million, respectively. Landlord incentives or allowances under operating
leases are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction of rent expense
over the lease term. Those operating leases with step rent provisions or
escalation clauses that are not considered contingent rent are recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. For those leases that include an
existing index or rate, such as the consumer price index or the prime interest
rate, the related minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term and the amount of rent considered to be contingent is
recorded as incurred and is not included in the straight-line basis rent
expense. We do not receive significant sublease rentals under any of our
existing operating leases. Certain of our leases contain renewal options, which
range from additional rental periods of one to five years. Escalation clauses
are also included in certain of our leases. There are no significant
restrictions imposed by our lease agreements concerning such issues as dividend
payments, incurrence of additional debt or further leasing. As of December31, 2009, we had the following
rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases in thousands

401kPlan We have a defined contribution 401kplan. Our
matching contribution currently represents 50% of a participants contribution,
up to the first 6% of the participants salary. We recorded contribution
expense of approximately $16 million, $17 million and $13 million for each
of the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Legal Proceedings We are party to various legal proceedings, including
that noted below. While management presently believes that the ultimate outcome
of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, overall trends in results of operations or cash flows, litigation is
subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An
unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or equitable relief, and
could have a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which
the ruling occurs or in future periods. Valencia County Detention Center In
April2007, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the Federal
District Court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Joe Torres and Eufrasio Armijo,
who each alleged that he was strip searched at the Valencia County Detention
Center VCDC in New Mexico in violation of his federal rights under the
Fourth, Fourteenth and Eighth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The
claimants also alleged violation of their rights under state law and sought to
bring the case as a class action 70 Table of Contents on
behalf of themselves and all detainees at VCDC during the applicable statutes
of limitation. The plaintiffs sought damages and declaratory and injunctive
relief. Valencia County is also a named defendant in the case and
operated the VCDC for a significantly greater portion of the period covered by
the lawsuit. In
December2008, the parties agreed to a proposed stipulation of settlement
and, in July2009, the Court granted final approval of the
settlement. The settlement amount under
the terms of the agreement is $33 million.
Cornells
portion of the stipulated settlement, based on the number of inmates housed at
VCDC during the time Cornell operated the facility in comparison to the number
of inmates housed at the facility during the time Valencia County operated the
facility, is $12 million and was funded principally through our general
liability and professional liability coverage. The claims administration
process is under way and we expect it to be completed in the first half of
2010. In
the year ended December31, 2007, we previously provided insurance
reserves for this matter as part of our regular review of reported and
unreported claims totaling approximately $05 million. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we
recorded an additional settlement charge of approximately $07 million and the
related reimbursement from our general liability and professional liability
insurance. The charge and reimbursement
were recognized in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December31,
2008. The reimbursement was funded by
the insurance carrier in the first quarter of 2009 into a settlement account, where it will
remain until payments are made to the settlement class members. Other We
hold insurance policies to cover potential director and officer liability, some
of which may limit our cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to us
in the matter discussed above. However, if an adverse decision in the matter
exceeds the insurance coverage or if the insurance coverage is deemed not to
apply to the matter, it could have a material adverse effect on us, our
financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows. We
currently and from time to time are subject to claims and suits arising in the
ordinary course of business, including claims for damages for personal injuries
or for wrongful restriction of or interference with offender privileges and
employment matters. If an adverse decision in these matters exceeds our
insurance coverage, or if our coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters,
or if the underlying insurance carrier was unable to fulfill its obligation
under the insurance coverage provided, it could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. While
the outcome of such other matters cannot be predicted with certainty, based on
the information known to date, we believe that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but
could be material to operating results or cash flows for a particular reporting
period. 13. EQUITY Preferred Stock Preferred stock may be issued from time to time by
our Board of Directors, which is responsible for determining the voting,
dividend, redemption, conversion and liquidation features of any preferred
stock. Options and
Warrants Under our 2000 Broad-Based Employee Plan the 2000
Plan we may grant non-qualified stock options to our employees, directors and
eligible consultants for up to the greater of 400,000 shares or 4% of the
aggregate number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately
after grant of any option under the 2000 Plan. However, in conjunction with the
approval of the amended and restated 2006 Incentive Plan and the amendments to
the 2000 Directors Stock Plan, the Company agreed not to thereafter grant any
additional awards under the 2000 Broad-Based Employee Plan or the 1996 Stock Option
Plan. The 2000 Plan options vest up to five years and expire ten years from the
grant date. Under our 1996 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated in April1998
the 1996 Plan we may grant non-qualified and incentive stock options for up
to the greater of 1,932,119 shares or 150% of the aggregate number of shares
of common stock outstanding. The 1996 Plan options vest up to seven years and
expire seven to ten years from the grant date. The Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors, which consists entirely of independent directors, is
responsible for determining the exercise price and vesting terms for the
granted options. The 1996 Plan and 2000 Plan option exercise prices could be no
less than the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. In conjunction with the issuance of subordinated
notes in July2000 which are no longer outstanding, we issued warrants
to purchase 290,370 shares of the common stock at an exercise price of $670.
We recognized the fair value of these warrants of $11 million as additional
paid-in capital. The warrants could only be exercised by payment of the
exercise price 71 Table of Contents in
cash to us, by cancellation of an amount of warrants equal to the fair market
value of the exercise price, or by the cancellation of our indebtedness owed to
the warrant holder. During 2001, 168,292 shares of our common stock were issued
in conjunction with the exercise and cancellation of 217,778 warrants. At December31,
2006, 72,592 warrants were outstanding.
During 2007, all 72,592 warrants were exercised and canceled. For a summary of the status of our various option
plans at December31, 2009, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial
statements. Treasury Stock We did not repurchase any of our common stock in the
years ended December31, 2009 and 2008. Under the terms of our Senior
Notes and our Amended Credit Facility, we can purchase shares of our stock
subject to certain cumulative restrictions. Under
the terms of our Senior Notes and our Amended Credit Facility, we can purchase
shares of our stock subject to certain cumulative restrictions. In July2009, our Board of Directors
authorized a stock repurchase program which provides for up to $100 million in
purchases through December2010. In
September2009, we adopted a 10b5-1 Plan to facilitate purchases of our
common stock pursuant to such stock repurchase plan. The Company may also repurchase our common
stock in open market purchases. Employee Stock
Purchase Plan We have an employee stock purchase plan under which
employees can make contributions to purchase our common stock. Participation in
the plan is elected annually by employees. The plan year begins each January1stthe Exercise Date and ends on December31stthe Ending Date. Purchases of common stock are made at the end

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND GUARANTEES Debt Service
Reserve Fund and Debt Service Fund In August2001, MCF completed a bond offering
to finance the 2001 Sale and Leaseback Transaction in which we sold eleven
facilities as identified in Item 1 of this report to MCF. In connection with
this bond offering, two reserve fund accounts were established by MCF pursuant
to the terms of the indenture: 1MCFs Debt Service Reserve Fund,
aggregating $234 million at December31, 2009, was established to: amake
payments on MCFs outstanding bonds in the event we as lessee should fail to
make the scheduled rental payments to MCF or bto the extent payments
were not made under a, then to make final debt service payments on the then
outstanding bonds and 2MCFs Bond Fund Payment Account, as reported in
Bond Fund Payment Account and other restricted assets in our Consolidated
Balance Sheet aggregating $98 million at December31, 2009, was
established to accumulate the monthly lease payments that MCF receives from us
until such funds are used to pay MCFs semi-annual bond interest and annual
bond principal payments, with any excess to pay certain other expenses and to
make certain transfers. These reserve funds are invested in short-term money
markets and commercial paper. Both reserve fund accounts were subject to the
agreements with the MCF Equity Investors Lehman Brothers,Inc. Lehman
whereby guaranteed rates of return of 30% and 508%, respectively, are
provided for in the balance of the Debt Service Reserve Fund and the Bond Fund
Payment Account. The guaranteed rates of return were characterized as cash flow
hedge derivative instruments. At inception, the derivatives had an aggregate
fair value of $40 million, which has been recorded as a decrease to the equity
investment in MCF made by the MCF Equity Investors MCF non-controlling
interest and is included in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments were
recorded as an adjustment to other long-term liabilities and reported as other
comprehensive income loss in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income Loss. Due to the bankruptcy of Lehman in 2008, the
derivative instrument no longer qualified as a hedge and was de-designated.
Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified
into earnings during the same periods in which interest is earned on the debt
service funds approximately $03 million was amortized and recognized in
earnings in the year ended December31, 2009 and none in either of the
years ended December31, 2008 and 2007. Changes in the fair value of this
derivative after de-designation were recorded into earnings. At December31,
2008, the fair value was determined to be zero. The derivatives were terminated
by MCF in the first quarter of 2009 with a fair value of zero. In connection with MCFs bond offering, Lehman also
provided a guarantee of the Debt Service Reserve Fund if a bankruptcy of the
Company were to occur and a trustee for the estate of the Company were to
include the Debt Service Reserve Fund as an asset of the Companys estate. This
guarantee was characterized as an insurance contract and its fair value was
being amortized to expense over the life of the debt. Due to the bankruptcy of
Lehman in 2008, the full carrying value of the guarantee was determined to be
unrecoverable. Accordingly, we recorded
a charge of $13 million in the year ended December31, 2008. This charge
is included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. 15. RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS In
September1999, we entered into a non-compete agreement with Cornells
founder, David Cornell, who was a director of Cornell through October2003. The non-compete agreement had a term of 10
years and required us to pay a monthly fee of $10,000 for the seven-year
initial term of the consulting agreement.
We capitalized the monthly payments and amortized the amounts over the
10-year term of the non-compete agreement. Due to his death in December2008,
the remaining unamortized balance was written-off. We recognized amortization
expense related to this agreement of approximately $84,000 for each of the
years ended December31, 2008 and 2007. These expenses were included in
general and administrative expenses in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
maintained a life insurance policy for Mr.Cornell and made payments
related to this policy of approximately $02 million for each of the years
ended December31, 2008 and 2007. As a result of Mr.Cornells death
in December2008, we received a return of cash premiums previously paid of
approximately $20 million in December2008. We
entered into a consulting agreement with a former director, Arlene Lissner,
which expired in December2008.
Services rendered under this agreement included research and analysis
for various topics including data collection, support and training for program
development; performance-based contractual requirements and performance-improvement
processes, accreditations and regulatory requirements. Payments under this agreement totaled $03
million for each of the years ended December31, 2008 and 2007. The agreement concluded in 2008 and was not
renewed. 73 Table of Contents 16. SEGMENT
DISCLOSURE Our three operating divisions are our reportable
segments. The Adult Secure Services segment consists of the operations of
secure adult incarceration facilities. The Abraxas Youth and Family Services
segment consists of providing residential treatment and educational programs
and non-residential community-based programs to juveniles between the ages of
10 and 18 who have either been adjudicated or suffer from behavioral problems.
The Adult Community-Based Services segment consists of providing pre-release
and halfway house programs for adult offenders who are either on probation or
serving the last three to six-months of their sentences on parole and preparing
for re-entry into society at large as well as community-based treatment and
education programs as an alternative to incarceration. All of our customers and
long-lived assets are located in the United States of America. The accounting
policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements. Intangible assets are not included in each segments
reportable assets, and the amortization of intangible assets is not included in
the determination of a segments operating income. We evaluate performance
based on income or loss from operations before general and administrative
expenses, incentive bonuses, amortization of intangibles, interest and income
taxes. Corporate and other assets are comprised primarily of cash, investment
securities available for sale, accounts receivable, debt service fund,
deposits, property and equipment, deferred taxes, deferred costs and other assets.
Corporate and other expense from operations primarily consists of depreciation
and amortization on the corporate office facilities and equipment and specific
general and administrative charges pertaining to corporate personnel and is
presented separately as such charges cannot be readily identified for
allocation to a particular segment. 74 Table of Contents The only significant non-cash items reported in the
respective segments income from operations is depreciation and amortization
excluding intangibles and impairment of long-lived assets in thousands.

Item 5. CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information disclosed in our annual and periodic reports is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rulesand forms. In addition, we
designed these disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that this
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief
executive officer CEO and chief financial officer CFO, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosures. SEC rulesrequire that we
disclose the conclusions of our CEO and CFO about the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures. We do not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors or fraud. A control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Because of the inherent limitation in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud could occur and not be detected. Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, and as required by paragraph bof
Rules13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eof the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period required by this report. Based on
that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective as of
that date. CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING In connection with the
evaluation as required by paragraph dof Rules13a-15 and 15d-15 of
the Exchange Act, we have not identified any change in internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules13a-15fand
15d-15funder the Exchange Act that occurred during our fiscal quarter
ended December31, 2009 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of Cornell
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for Cornell. Cornells
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.
Cornells internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and, iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Due to its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We have assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2009. To make this assessment we used
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in Internal Control Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on our assessment, we have concluded that, as of December31, 2009,
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective. 85 Table of Contents The effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. REPORT
