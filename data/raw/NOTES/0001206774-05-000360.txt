39 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Avigen, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Avigen, Inc. a development stage company as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and for the period from inception October 22, 1992 through December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Avigen, Inc. at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 and for the period from inception October 22, 1992 through December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Avigen Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Avigen, Inc. was incorporated on October 22, 1992 in Delaware and is focused on developing innovative therapeutics to treat serious disorders, primarily for neurological conditions. We have developed proprietary DNA-based drug delivery technologies, including our proprietary gene-delivery platform based on adeno-associated virus AAV vectors. We are actively pursuing the acquisition or in-licensing of later-stage drug development candidates of more conventional pharmaceutical drugs that compliment our focus on neurological diseases. 
We are also currently using our DNA-based drug delivery technologies to develop a novel gene therapeutic for advanced Parkinsons disease and are enrolling subjects in a phase I/II clinical trial. Since our inception, our activities have consisted principally of acquiring product rights, raising capital, establishing facilities and performing research and development. Accordingly, we are considered to be in the development stage. We operate in a single segment.
At December 31, 2004, we had an accumulated deficit of $1566 million and expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years while we continue in this development stage. We plan to meet our capital requirements primarily through issuances of equity securities, payments under collaborative agreements with third parties, government grants, and license fees. We intend to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing, when market conditions allow. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into financing arrangements on acceptable terms in the future, if at all. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. These amounts are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value.
Available- for-Sale Securities
We invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities, primarily corporate debt securities, federal agency obligations, asset-backed securities, U.S. treasuries, and municipal bonds, with the primary investment objectives of preservation of principal, a high degree of liquidity, and maximum total return. We have classified our investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at market value and unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, if any, are excluded from earnings and are reported in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized. A decline in the market value of a security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary is charged to earnings, and would result in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security. Our available-for-sale securities consist principally of obligations with a minimum short-term rating of A1/P1 and a minimum long-term rating of A- and with effective maturities of less than three years. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included in interest income.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of our cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our loans payable is based on current interest rates available to us for debt instruments with similar terms, degrees of risk, and remaining maturities. The carrying amount of our cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and loan payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair value at December 31, 2004 and 2003. 
Restricted Investments
In June 2000, we initially entered into a financing arrangement to support construction related activities. Under this arrangement, we have pledged $100 million of our portfolio of available-for-sale securities to secure this long-term obligation. 
In January 2002, we also entered into equipment operating leases for certain research and development equipment. Under the terms of these leases, we have pledged $15 million of our portfolio of available-for-sale securities to secure these equipment operating leases. 
In May 2003, we secured two letters of credit to serve as security deposits in connection with a building lease that became effective July 1, 2003. This building lease was executed in February 2000 and replaced our previous building lease and sublease on the same premises that expired June 30, 2003 under the original terms of the agreements. Under the terms of these letters of credit, we have pledged $428,000 of our portfolio of available-for-sale securities to secure these letters of credit. 
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $119 million was classified as restricted investments in long term assets, representing the combined aggregate portion of our portfolio of available-for-sale securities that were pledged in connection with these long-term liabilities.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Cash, cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities and restricted investments consist of financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk to the extent of the value of the assets recorded on the balance sheet. We believe that we have established guidelines for investment of our excess cash that maintain safety and liquidity through our policies on diversification among asset classes and issuers, as well as across investment maturities.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment range from three to seven years. 
Expenses for repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. Upon retirement, disposition, or sale, the cost of the property and equipment disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are deducted from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to operations.
Revenue Recognition
We record revenue associated with up-front license, technology access, and research and development funding payments under collaboration agreements for the development of our product candidates ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreements, generally the development phase. The development phase can be defined as a
51 AVIGEN, INC. a development stage company
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
specified period of time, however, in certain cases, the collaborative agreement specifies a development phase that culminates with milestone objectives but does not have a fixed date, which requires us to estimate the development period of those product candidates. The estimate of the development period may be revised as additional information is received or actual results differ from expectations. For example, in March 2003, we received a $25 million payment from Bayer Corporation under the terms of our collaboration agreement for the development of Coagulin-B, our product candidate that we were developing for the treatment of hemophilia B, involving administration to the liver. This amount was recorded as deferred revenue and was being recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated development period for this product, which was determined to be five years, or approximately $125,000 per quarter. 
In May 2004, we announced the suspension of subject enrollment in our phase I clinical trial involving the administration of Coagulin-B to the liver. This resulted in the termination of the development of the liver-targeted product candidate associated with the March 2003 Bayer payment. As a result, we accelerated the recognition of the remaining $20 million of deferred revenue in our statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.
We record grant revenue in the period in which the revenue is earned as defined by the grant agreement. Since our inception, we have recognized approximately $690,000 of grant revenue, which includes amounts earned pursuant to reimbursements under government grants, of which all have come from the National Institutes of Health. 
We record royalty revenue from license agreements as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third-party results can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured. We have recorded approximately $35,000 in royalty revenue in connection with sales from a third party of products that utilize our AAV technologies over the last four years. These products are sold for research purposes only and were primarily sold within the U.S. 
Non-refundable product license fees, including fees associated with research license agreements, for which we have no further performance obligations, and no continuing involvement requirements, are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured. We have recorded approximately $220,000 in research license fees since our inception.
Comprehensive Loss
Components of other comprehensive loss, including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, were included as part of total comprehensive loss. For all periods presented, we have disclosed comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are charged to expense in the period incurred and include related salaries and benefits, laboratory materials, clinical trial and related clinical-trial-manufacturing costs, contract and outside service fees, and facilities and overhead costs. Research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for our independent, as well as our collaborative, research and development activities.
Clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with the clinical trial sites. We determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services. These estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by subject enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor clinical trial activities to the extent possible; however, if we underestimated activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time, we could record
significant research and development expenses in future periods.

Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. To date, we have no history of earnings. Therefore, our net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that realization of the related deferred tax asset is not assured.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of basic net loss per share for all periods presented is derived from the information on the face of the statement of operations, and there are no reconciling items in either the numerator or denominator. 
Diluted net loss per common share is computed as though all potential common shares that are dilutive were outstanding during the year, using the treasury stock method for the purposes of calculating the weighted-average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potential dilutive common shares consist of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants. Securities that potentially could have diluted basic earnings per common share, but were excluded from the diluted net loss per common share computation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive, were as follows

1 For purposes of computing the potential dilutive common shares, we have excluded outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase common stock whose exercise prices exceed the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ National Market for the period.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
We regularly evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is assessed using discounted cash flows. To date, we have not experienced any such losses. 
Reclassifications
We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to our current years presentation of cash flow used in investing activities for purchases of available-for-sale securities and provided by sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and our components of gross deferred tax assets in Note 11. These reclassifications had no impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or the net cash flow from investing activities reported on our statement of cash flows.

New Accounting Pronouncements
In March2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB approved Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The objective of this issue is to provide guidance for identifying other-than-temporarily impaired investments. EITF No03-1 also provides new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September2004, the FASB issued EITF No03-1-1, which delayed the effective date of EITF No03-1, with the exception of certain disclosure requirements. We do not believe that the adoption of EITF No03-1 will have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, FAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. APB 29 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. FAS 153 amends APB 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. FAS 153 becomes effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 153 to have
a material impact on our financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. 
In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123R, FAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. FAS 123R supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. FAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant i.e., pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. FAS 123R is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. The FASB believes the use of a binomial
lattice model for option valuation is capable of more fully reflecting certain characteristics of employee share options compared to the Black-Scholes options pricing model. The new standard may be adopted in one of three ways - the modified prospective transition method, a variation of the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating how we will adopt the standard. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 123R to have a material impact on our current compensation practices or our statement of cash flows.However, we do expect that our adoption of FAS 123R will significantly increase our reported operating expenses which would have a material impact on our results of operations and related financial position for all periods after adoption.

Stock-Based Compensation
We have elected to continue to follow APB 25 and related interpretations, to account for stock options granted to our employees and directors for the year ended December 31, 2004. Under APB 25, using the prescribed intrinsic value method of accounting, no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of the stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the option grant.
The information regarding net loss and loss per common share as required by FAS 123 has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method prescribed by FAS 123. The resulting effect on net loss and loss per common share pursuant to FAS 123 is not likely to be representative of the effects on net loss and loss per common share pursuant to FAS 123 in future years, since future years are likely to include additional grants and the variable impact of future years vesting. 
The following table illustrates the effect on our net loss and loss per common share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to our stock-based employee compensation in thousands, except for per share data

For purposes of disclosure pursuant to FAS 123, as amended by FAS 148, the estimated fair value of our employee stock options is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options, generally over four years. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our options on the date of grant. Options that were granted during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were valued with the following weighted average assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and warrants that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models, including Black-Scholes, require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because our stock options and warrants are not traded, they have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and warrants, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, the existing option valuation models, including Black-Scholes, do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock options and warrants. 
55 AVIGEN, INC. a development stage company
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Our employee stock options are granted at a price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of the grant. The weighted-average estimated fair values of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 as calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were $263, $260, and $649, respectively.
For equity awards to non-employees, including lenders, lessors, and consultants, we also apply the Black-Scholes method to determine the fair value of such investments in accordance with FAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods, or Services. The options and warrants granted to non-employees are re-measured as they vest and the resulting value is recognized as an expense against our net loss over the period during which the services are received or the term of the related financing.

4.Deferred Revenue 
In March 2003, we received a $25 million payment from Bayer Corporation under the terms of our collaboration agreement for the development of Coagulin-B, our product candidate that we were developing for the treatment of hemophilia B, involving administration to the liver. This amount was recorded as deferred revenue and was being recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated development period for this product, which was determined to be five years, or approximately $125,000 per quarter.
In May 2004, we announced the suspension of subject enrollment in our phase I clinical trial involving the administration of Coagulin-B to the liver. This resulted in the termination of the development of the liver-targeted product candidate associated with the March 2003 Bayer payment. As a result, we accelerated the recognition of the remaining $20 million of deferred revenue in our statements of operations during the year ended December 31, 2004.
5.Loan Payable
In June 2000, we entered into a financing arrangement to support construction related activities. Under this arrangement, we had the right to borrow up to $100 million through June 1, 2003. This revolving line of credit was amended in June 2002 to extend the expiration date to June 1, 2005, and amended again in June 2004 to extend the expiration date to June 1, 2007. Accordingly, the loan continues to be classified as long term. Amounts borrowed under this arrangement bear interest at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate plus a margin adjustment that varies between 05% and 10% on the date of each drawdown based on the market value of our investment portfolio held

with a subsidiary of Wells Fargo. This interest rate is subsequently reset every three months. The weighted average interest rate for all outstanding drawdowns on this long-term obligation was 270% at December 31, 2004 and 275% at December 31, 2003. We have pledged a portion of our portfolio of available-for-sale securities equal to the amount of outstanding borrowings to secure this long-term obligation, and have identified these pledged assets as restricted investments on our balance sheets. As of both December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had borrowed $80 million from the line of credit. Payments of interest only are due monthly through June 1, 2007, at which time a balloon payment of outstanding principal is due. In November 2000, we reserved $20 million in borrowing capacity from the line of credit to secure a letter of credit. The letter of credit was established pursuant to the terms required under a ten-year property
lease entered into in November 2000, and was issued in favor of the property owner. As a result of the cash borrowings and the establishment of the letter of credit, we did not have any remaining borrowing capacity under the line of credit at December 31, 2004.

Employee Stock Option Plans
Under the 1993 Stock Option Plan the 1993 Plan, prior to March 1996, incentive and nonqualified stock options could be granted to our key employees, directors and consultants to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock. Under the 1993Plan, options could be granted at a price per share not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. In March 1996, the Board determined to grant no further options under the 1993 Plan and adopted the 1996 Equity Incentive Plan. At December 31, 2004, there were options to purchase 27,844 shares outstanding under the 1993 Plan, with no further shares available for grant.
The 1996 Equity Incentive Plan 1996 Plan provides for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock purchase awards, stock bonuses and stock appreciation rights to our employees, directors and consultants. The Plan originally authorized the grant of options to purchase up to 600,000 shares of common stock. As a result of a series of amendments which were approved by stockholders, prior to December 31, 2004, there were 3,500,000 shares authorized for grant under the 1996 Plan. Under the 1996 Plan, incentive stock options may be granted at a price per share not less than the fair market value at the date of grant, and nonqualified stock options may be granted at a price per share not less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted generally have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and become exercisable
over four years. At December 31, 2004, there were options to purchase 1,099,559 shares outstanding under the 1996 Plan and 1,651,239 shares available for grant. 
In June 2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan 2000 Plan which provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, restricted stock purchase awards, and stock bonuses to our employees, directors and consultants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock; provided, however, that generally only up to 40% of the shares subject to grants under the 2000 Plan may be made to our directors and officers. Under the 2000 Plan, options may be granted at a price per share not less than 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted generally have a maximum term of 10 years from the grant date and become exercisable over four years. At December 31, 2004, there were options to purchase 2,539,694 shares outstanding under the 2000 Plan and 2,456,625 shares available for grant.

Non-employee Stock Options 
In July 1995, we granted the Chairman of our Board of Directors an option to purchase 515,248 shares of our common stock at $049 per share, exercisable for 10 years from the date of grant. At December 31, 2004, the option was fully vested; however, no part of this option had been exercised. Such grant was made outside of any of our stock option plans.
The 1996 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan provides for automatic grants of options to purchase shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors. The Plan originally authorized the grant of options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of common stock. As a result of a series of amendments which were approved by stockholders, prior to December 31, 2004, there were 550,000 shares authorized for grant under the Directors Plan at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, nonqualified options to purchase approximately 287,383 shares of common stock between $200 and $4075 per share, exercisable for 10 years from the date of grant, have been granted under the Directors Plan, of which options to purchase 242,383 shares remained outstanding.

In March 2004, in connection with the resignation of an executive, we modified the vesting and expiration terms, but did not extend the maximum contractual term, of certain stock options. These modifications resulted in the recognition of $220,000 in non-cash compensation expense during 2004. 
In February 2003, in connection with the resignation of two executives, we modified the vesting and expiration terms, but did not extend the maximum contractual term, of certain stock options. These modifications resulted in the recognition of $28,000 in non-cash compensation expense during 2003.
8.Employee Profit Sharing/401k Plan
In January 1996, we adopted a Tax Deferred Savings Plan under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Plan for all full-time employees. Under the Plan, our eligible employees can contribute amounts to the Plan via payroll withholding, subject to certain limitations. Our matching contributions to the Plan are discretionary and can only be made in cash. Effective July 1, 2001, we began matching 25% of an employees contributions up to $2,500 per Plan year. These matching contributions vest ratably over a five-year period based on the employees initial hire date. Our matching contributions for all employees for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $100,000, $112,000, and $134,000, respectively.
9.Collaboration Agreement
In November 2000, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer Corporation Bayer for the development of our Coagulin-B product for the treatment of hemophilia B. Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer, in collaboration with us, would conduct Phase II/III clinical trials for the product and receive exclusive worldwide marketing and distribution rights to the product. In connection with this collaboration agreement, in February 2001, we issued to Bayer AG, an affiliate of Bayer, 313,636 shares of common stock at $4782 per share, resulting in proceeds of $15 million.
64 AVIGEN, INC. a development stage company
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
In March 2003, under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we received a $25 million payment from Bayer in connection with the ongoing development of Coagulin-B, which is discussed further in Note 1 and Note 4. 
In May 2004, we announced a mutual decision to end the phase I clinical trial protocol of Coagulin-B. In August 2004, both parties agreed that Avigen had met all of its contractual obligations required under the collaboration agreement and in December 2004, Bayer terminated the collaboration agreement.
As a result of the termination, Bayer no longer has any financial obligations to finance Phase II/III development of Coagulin-B and all patent and know-how rights licensed to Bayer under the agreement completely revert back to Avigen. Since Avigen was solely responsible for funding the Phase I development, the termination of the agreement has no financial impact on Avigen. In addition, Avigen has the right to develop a product for the treatment of hemophilia B independently or in collaboration with another corporate partner in the future. 
10.Commitments
We lease our laboratory, manufacturing, and office facilities and certain equipment under multiple non-cancelable operating lease agreements, which expire at various times through November 2010. Under our two facilities operating leases, we have pledged $24 million of our available-for-sale securities to secure letters of credit that serve as deposits that are required under the terms of the leases. Under multiple equipment operating leases, we have pledged $15 million of our available-for-sale securities as collateral for the leases. These amounts are included in restricted investments on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004 and 2003. We have the option to purchase the equipment under these operating leases at the greater of their fair value at the end of the lease or 20% of the original cost.
Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands

While these contracts are cancelable, we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements, and all amounts paid when due. At December 31, 2004, the estimated costs related to these commitments totaled approximately $646,000, all of which is expected to be paid within the next twelve to twenty-four months.

No provision has been made for income taxes because we have incurred losses since our inception. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Due to our history of losses, a valuation allowance has been provided against the full amount of deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing any benefits from these assets. The valuation allowance increased by $10,000,000, $11,000,000, and $12,200,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Deferred tax assets related to carryforwards at December 31, 2004 include approximately $1,400,000 associated with stock option activity for which any subsequently recognized benefits will be credited directly to stockholders equity.
At December 31, 2004, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $149,000,000 and $31,000,000, respectively, which expire in 2005 through 2024. At December 31, 2004, we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $5,000,000 and $3,600,000, respectively, which expire in 2009 through 2024.
Because of the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilization of our tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods. As a result of the annual limitation, a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities.
During the preparation of our Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, we determined that our calculation of deferred tax assets for 2003 was underreported, primarily due to the accumulated temporary differences for the recognition of depreciation expense. Accordingly, the amounts reported in the table above for the year ended December 31, 2003 have been revised, resulting in an increase of gross deferred tax assets and offsetting increase in valuation allowance of approximately $13 million, respectively. This revision had no effect on our previously reported results of operations or financial condition.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, managements assessment that Avigen, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Avigen, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Avigen, Inc. as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 and the period from inception October 22, 1998 through December 31, 2004 of Avigen, Inc. and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo Alto, California March 10, 2005
