Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Merix Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Merix Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of May31, 2008 and May26, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, statements of shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
statements of cash flows for the years ended May31, 2008 and May26, 2007. Our audits of the basic financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under  a2. These financial

MERIX CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Business Merix Corporation, an
Oregon corporation, was formed in March 1994. Merix is a leading global manufacturing service provider for technologically advanced printed circuit boards PCBs for original equipment manufacturer OEM customers, and their electronic manufacturing
service EMS providers. The Companys principal products are complex multi-layer rigid PCBs, which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors, integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of
electronic products and systems. The market segments the Company serves are primarily in commercial equipment for the communications and networking, computing and peripherals, test, industrial and medical, defense and aerospace and automotive
markets. The Companys markets are generally characterized by rapid technological change, high levels of complexity and short product life cycles, as new and technologically superior electronic equipment is continually being developed.
The Company services its customers from its headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon and North American manufacturing facilities in Forest Grove, Oregon and San
Jose, California. The Company also maintains administrative offices in Hong Kong and manufacturing facilities in Huiyang and Huizhou, China. The Company also maintains a direct sales force located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, the Peoples Republic of China China, or the PRC, Hong Kong and Singapore. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Merix Corporation and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company. Except
for activity related to Merix Asia, for which certain intercompany amounts cannot be eliminated as discussed below, all inter-company accounts, transactions and profits have been eliminated in consolidation. The Companys financial reporting systems at Merix Asia are predominantly manual in nature which requires significant time to process and review the transactions in
order to assure the financial information is properly stated. Additionally, Merix Asia performs a complex financial consolidation of its subsidiaries prior to the Companys final consolidation. The time required to complete Merix Asias
consolidation, record intercompany transactions and properly report any adjustments, intervening and/or subsequent events requires the use of a one-month lag in consolidating the financial statements for Merix Asia with Merix Corporation.
Inter-company transactions which occurred during these periods have been eliminated in consolidation. Inter-company balances resulting from transactions with Merix Asia during the one-month lag period have been netted and presented as a current
asset or current liability on the consolidated balance sheet. The net intercompany receivable included as a component of other current assets totaled $02 million at May31, 2008. The net intercompany payable included as a component of other
accrued liabilities totaled $08 million as of May26, 2007. The Company selected a new enterprise resource planning ERP system to support its
transition to a global business in May 2006 and completed implementation for its North America operations during fiscal 2008. The Company is currently in the process of implementing the new ERP system at Merix Asia, which may eventually eliminate
the need for the one-month reporting lag for Merix Asia. 
56 Table of Contents
Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in May. Accordingly, fiscal 2008 was comprised of 53 weeks ending on May31, 2008. Fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 each comprised 52 weeks and ended on
May26, 2007 and May27, 2006, respectively. All references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted. Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. These
reclassifications had no impact on previously reported results of operations. Segment Reporting The Company has three reportable business segments defined by geographic location in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information: 1Merix Oregon, 2Merix San Jose and 3Merix Asia. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial
information is available and regularly reviewed by senior management. The Companys operating segments are evidence of the internal structure of its organization. Each segment operates in the same industry with production facilities that
produce similar customized products for its customers. The production facilities, sales management and chief decision-makers for all processes are managed by the same executive team. The Companys chief operating decision maker is its Chief
Executive Officer. Segment disclosures are presented to the gross profit level as this is the primary performance measure for which the segment managers are responsible. No other operating results information is provided to the chief operating
decision maker for review at the segment level. Managements Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those
estimates. Management believes that the estimates used are reasonable. Significant estimates and judgments made by management of the Company relate to:  the allowance for doubtful accounts;  the valuation of excess and obsolete inventories and idle facilities;  product warranty liabilities;  the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets;  the valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;  share-based compensation;  legal contingencies; and  accounting for income taxes. Fair Value of
Financial Assets and Liabilities We estimate the fair value of our monetary assets and liabilities based upon comparison of such assets and
liabilities to the current market values for instruments of a similar nature and degree of risk. Our monetary assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and long-term debt. Due to their short-term nature, we estimate that the recorded value of our monetary assets and liabilities, except long-term debt as disclosed below, approximated fair value as of May31, 2008 and May26,
2007. 
57 Table of Contents
The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market
value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise; however, the quoted market price for the Companys debt is currently reflecting a significant risk premium. At May31, 2008 and
May26, 2007, respectively, the book value of our fixed rate debt and the fair value, based upon open market trades, if available, or discounted cash flows, was as follows in thousands:  2008
2007
Book value of fixed rate debt 70,000 77,594 Fair value of fixed rate debt 38,106 67,382 Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions The consolidated financial statements of the Companys foreign operations have been translated in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency
Translation, which requires that assets, liabilities and operations of a foreign entity be measured using the functional currency of that entity. The functional currency of the foreign subsidiaries is the U.S.dollar, with the exception
of the foreign sales offices, which use their respective local currencies as the functional currency. The reporting currency of the Company and its
subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For those foreign subsidiaries whose books of record are not maintained in their respective functional currency, remeasurement into the functional currency is required before translation into the reporting currency.
Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated into the U.S.dollar at weighted average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency
translation adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S.dollars are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity. Transactions involving a currency other than the functional currency generate a gain or loss from the fluctuation of the currency relative to the functional currency and
are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations during the respective period in which they occur. The Company currently does not utilize any derivative instruments to mitigate potential foreign currency transaction losses. Net foreign
currency transaction losses were $13 million during fiscal 2008 and $07 million during both fiscal 2007 and 2006 and were included as a component of other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent
cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to
the short maturities. Short-Term Investments In accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, investments in auction rate securities are classified as available-for-sale short-term investments. Available-for-sale
securities are recorded at fair value, as determined by quoted market prices, with unrealized holding gains and losses if any, net of tax, classified as a separate component of shareholders equity. Upon sale of the investments, any
previously unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. The specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold. The Company reviews short-term investments on a periodic
basis to evaluate whether such securities have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. If an other-than-temporary decline in value exists, an impairment charge is recorded within the consolidated statements of operations as the
difference between the carrying value of the impaired investments and the net realizable value of the impaired investments. 
58 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable, net The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of the accounts receivable balance and the Company maintains a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the customers to make
required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, the Company considers its historical bad debt experience, ongoing credit evaluations of customers and changes in the customers businesses. Considerable management judgment and
assumptions are necessary to identify uncollectible receivables and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their
inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. Inventories, net Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Cost is determined by standard cost, which approximates the
first-in, first-out FIFO basis. Provisions for inventories are made to reduce excess inventories to their estimated net realizable values, as necessary.
A change in customer demand for inventory is the primary indicator for reductions in inventory carrying values. The Company records inventory provisions based on historical experiences with customers, the ability to utilize inventory in other
programs, the ability to redistribute inventory back to the suppliers and current and forecasted demand for the inventory. The Company maintains finished
goods inventories on a consignment basis at certain customer locations in the U.S. and in Asia. Consignment inventory is recorded as inventory until the product is pulled from the consignment inventories by the customer and all risks and rewards of
ownership of the consignment inventory have been transferred to the customer. The Company follows the guidance of SFASNo151, Inventory
Costs An Amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized
as current-period charges. Additionally, SFAS No151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. The Company is required to estimate the
amount of idle capacity and expense amounts in the current period. Pursuant to SFAS No151, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company expensed $05 million related to abnormally low production volumes at the Companys Oregon
operation as a component of cost of sales. There were no amounts expensed related to abnormally low production volumes and related excess capacity in fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2006. Assets Held for Sale Assets held for sale are recorded on the Companys balance sheet at the lower of
book value or estimated fair market value, less applicable selling costs, and are no longer being depreciated. See Note 6. Property, Plant and
Equipment, net Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs of improvements that significantly extend the
useful life or significantly increase the capacity of assets, including major upgrades or implementations in management information systems, plus related interest and qualifying internal costs, are capitalized. Costs related to the implementation of
an ERP system that met the criteria for capitalization under Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed of Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1 totaled $70 million and $56 million, respectively,
in fiscal 2008 and 2007. Capitalized interest totaled $03 million and $02 million, respectively, in fiscal 2008 and 2007. There were no costs capitalized under SOP 98-1 or capitalized interest costs recorded in fiscal 2006. Maintenance and repair
costs are charged to expense as incurred. As property and equipment is sold or retired, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated
from the asset accounts and any gain or loss thereon is recorded. Property, plant and 
59 Table of Contents
equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets, which approximate up to 40 years for buildings
and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. For Merix Oregon and Merix San Jose, leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the economic
life of the asset or the contractual term of the lease. Optional renewal periods are included in the contractual term of the lease if renewal is reasonably assured at the time the asset is placed in service. For Merix Asias Huizhou facility, leasehold improvements are amortized over the economic useful life of ten years. Merix Asias Huizhou facility has
noncancelable operating lease agreements with lease terms ending through fiscal 2011 with no stated lease renewal options. However, as the lessor is the minority interest holder in the Asia subsidiary and it is reasonably assured that these lease
agreements will be renewed and management has intentions to operate the leased manufacturing facilities indefinitely, the tenant improvements within the leased facilities are amortized over a period longer than the current underlying contractual
lease obligations. Asset Retirement Obligations In accordance with SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, the Company recognizes the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair
value can be made. The present value of the estimated asset retirement obligation is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset. The liability is accreted at the end
of each period through charges to operating expenses. If the asset retirement obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company will recognize a gain or loss upon settlement. See Note 12 for additional
information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Companys long-lived assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an indicator of impairment is noted, assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. If the sum of expected undiscounted future cash
flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate
commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that the fair values are reduced for disposal costs. Considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify
indicators of impairment and to estimate discounted future cash flows. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. Asset
impairments, excluding goodwill impairments, related to continuing operations totaled $125 million, $266 million and $05 million, respectively, in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. See Note 17 for additional information. During fiscal 2007, the Company
also recorded a net $11 million asset impairment charge related to discontinued operations. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
In accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment, at least
annually, or when events indicate that impairment may exist. The impairment test is a two step process. The first identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill and other
identifiable intangible assets. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are not impaired and the second step is not necessary. If the carrying value exceeds the fair
value, the second step includes determining the implied fair value through further market research. The implied fair value of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets is then compared with the carrying amount to determine if an impairment
loss is recorded. The Company performed its testing in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and determined that there was no impairment in fiscal 2008 or 2006. 
60 Table of Contents
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company determined that goodwill impairment charges totaling $533 million were
required. A review of the implied fair value and related book value of the goodwill associated with the Merix San Jose and Merix Asia operations resulted in impairment charges of $142 million for Merix San Jose and $391 million for Merix Asia. See
Note 17 for additional information. Intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with SFAS No144, as discussed above. The Company reviewed these assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and
determined that no impairment existed. Leasehold Land Use Rights, Net Leasehold land use rights, net represents amounts paid to lease land in China. Amounts are paid at the beginning of the lease term and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the initial
50-year lease terms ending 2052. Deferred Financing Costs Debt issuance costs and loan origination fees paid are deferred and amortized at the rate of approximately $02 million per quarter through May 2013 as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt to
which they relate and are included on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets. See Notes 10 and 13. Warranty
The Company generally warrants its products for a period of up to twelve months from the point of sale. However, in selected circumstances, Merix
Asia grants longer warranty periods to certain customers of up to three years. The Company records a liability for the estimated cost of the warranty upon transfer of ownership of the products to the customer. Using historical data, the Company
estimates warranty costs and records the provision for such charges as an element of cost of goods sold upon recognition of the related revenue. The Company also accrues warranty liability for certain specifically identified items that are not
covered by our assessment of historical experience. Warranty activity, adjusted for discontinued operations, for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows
in thousands:  2008 2007 2006 Balance, beginning of period 2,129 2,297 1,519 Warranty accrual acquired 3,006 Provision for warranty charges 3,565 3,383 1,369 Warranty charges incurred 3,547 3,551 3,597 Balance, end of period 2,147 2,129 2,297 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of its products to the customer provided that the price is fixed, delivery has occurred and title has transferred to the customer, collection of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured, product returns are reasonably estimable, there are no further customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations. Provisions for estimated sales returns and adjustments are made at
the point of revenue recognition based on historical experience. Sales adjustments are charged against consolidated net sales. Consignment sales are
recognized at the time the consignee uses the consignment goods and all criteria of revenue recognition described above have been satisfied. 
61 Table of Contents
Shipping and Handling Charges The Company incurs costs related to shipping and handling of its manufactured products. The Company expenses these costs as incurred as a component of cost of sales. The Company also incurs shipping and handling
charges related to the receipt of raw materials, which are recorded as a cost of the related inventory. Payments received from customers for shipping and handling costs are immaterial and are included as a component of net sales upon recognition of
the related sale. Taxes Assessed by a Governmental Authority The Company accounts for all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction i.e., sales, use, value added on a net basis and those taxes are excluded from net
sales. Concentrations of Risk The Company is
subject to concentrations of credit risk, primarily associated with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company
has significant credit risk attributable to its accounts receivable. The accounts receivable are either due from an OEM customer or its electronic manufacturing service provider, depending upon the billing arrangement. At May31, 2008, five
entities represented approximately 48% of the Companys net accounts receivable balance, individually ranging from approximately 5% to 18%. At May26, 2007, five entities represented approximately 43% of the Companys net accounts
receivable balance, individually ranging from approximately 4% to 15%. Certain of the Companys products use types of laminate materials that are
only available from a single supplier that holds a patent on the material. Although other manufacturers of advanced PCBs must also use the same supplier, and the Companys OEM customers generally determine the type of laminate materials used, a
failure to obtain the material from the single supplier for any reason may cause disruption and possible cancellation of orders for PCBs using that type of laminate, which in turn would cause a decrease in the Companys consolidated net sales.
Two customers accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively, of the Companys net sales in fiscal 2008 and accounted for 15% and 11%, respectively, in
fiscal 2007. One customer accounted for 20% of the Companys net sales in fiscal 2006. No other customer comprised more than 10% of net sales in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. Legal Contingencies Reserve In accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, all
legal contingencies which are judged to be both probable and estimable are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on the Companys best estimates. The Company regularly monitors its estimates in light of current
developments and changes in circumstances and the Company adjusts its legal reserves accordingly. If no particular amount is determined to constitute the Companys best estimate of a particular legal contingency, a range of the Companys
estimate of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claim is disclosed and the Company will accrue for the low end of the range of costs, unless otherwise disclosed. Considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to
estimate legal contingency reserves. Accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. Legal fees are expensed in the period in which they occur. Environmental Contingencies Accruals for environmental matters, if any, are recorded in operating expenses
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. Accrued environmental liabilities, if any, are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted. There were no
material environmental remediation liabilities at May31, 2008 and May26, 2007. 
62 Table of Contents
In general, ongoing costs related to environmental remediation are charged to expense. Environmental costs are
capitalized if such costs increase the value of the property and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. See Note 21. Engineering Expense Expenditures for engineering of products and manufacturing processes are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the
asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. In addition, effective May27, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, which clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must
satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a companys financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company recorded a transition adjustment of $18 million to beginning accumulated deficit
and $07 million as an adjustment to goodwill. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to potential liability for uncertain tax
positions as a component of tax expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. No penalties were recognized during fiscal 2008, fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The company recorded $04 million in accrued interest on the
potential liability for uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2008. Net Income Loss Per Share Basic income loss per share EPS and diluted EPS are computed using the methods prescribed by SFAS No128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No128
requires that the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents be excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the periods in which losses are reported because the effect is antidilutive. Basic and diluted earnings per
share are the same for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 as we were in a loss position for each of those years. Following is a reconciliation of the income
loss from continuing operations and shares used for basic and diluted EPS for the fiscal year ended May27, 2006 in thousands, except per share amounts:

4,203 Share-Based Compensation Effective May28, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment. The Company elected to use the modified prospective transition method as provided by SFAS No123R and,
accordingly, financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this Form 10-K have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share-based compensation. Under this method, the provisions of SFAS No123R apply
to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption over the remainder of the
requisite service period. The Companys deferred share-based compensation balance of $11 million as of May27, 2006, which was accounted for under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, was reclassified to common stock upon the adoption of SFAS No123R. Prior to May28, 2006, the Company accounted for
share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by APB Opinion No25 and related interpretations. No share-based compensation related to option grants was reflected in earnings in fiscal 2006, as all stock options
granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, pro forma disclosures were provided for net income and net
income per share as if share-based awards to employees had been accounted for in accordance with the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. This pro forma information for fiscal 2006
is as follows in thousands, except per share data:  2006 Net income, as reported 1,432 Add share-based compensation included in results of operations, net of related tax effects 188 Deduct total share-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax

Pro forma share-based compensation expense under SFAS No123, among other computational differences, does not
consider potential pre-vesting forfeitures. Because of these differences, the pro forma share-based compensation expense presented above for fiscal 2006 under SFAS No123 and the share-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2008
and 2007 under SFAS No123R are not directly comparable. NOTE 2. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurements. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. Where applicable, this statement simplifies and codifies related guidance within
generally accepted accounting principles. SFAS No157 does not apply under SFAS No123R, does not eliminate the practicability exceptions to fair value measurements in accounting pronouncements within the scope of the statement, and
does not apply under accounting pronouncements that require or permit measurements that are similar to fair value but that are not intended to measure fair value. SFAS No157 is effective for financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. The effective date for non-financial assets and liabilities that are not required or permitted to be recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis has been deferred to fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2008. The Company is currently analyzing the effects of adopting SFAS No157. In September 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position
No. AUG AIR-1, Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities, which prohibits accruing for the future cost of periodic major overhauls and planned maintenance of plant and equipment in annual and interim periods. This Staff
Position is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006 and must be retrospectively applied. As the Company does not accrue for such future costs, the adoption of AUG AIR-1 in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 did not have any
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No159 is effective as of the beginning of an entitys
first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS No159. In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, Business Combinations, and SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS Nos. 141R and 160 require most identifiable assets, liabilities,
noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity, which
changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders. Both statements are effective for periods beginning on or after December15, 2008 and earlier adoption is prohibited. SFAS No141R will be applied to business
combinations occurring after the effective date and SFAS No160 will be applied prospectively to all noncontrolling interests, including any that arose before the effective date. The Company is currently analyzing the effects of adopting SFAS
Nos. 141R and 160. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
requires certain disclosures related to derivative instruments. SFAS No161 is effective prospectively for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the effects, if any, that
the adoption of SFAS No161 will have on its financial position and results of operations. In April 2008, FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 142-3
Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets FSP 142-3. FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
under SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The intent of this Staff Position is to improve the consistency 
65 Table of Contents
between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the
asset under SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations, and other U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. FSP 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently reviewing the effect, if any, the proposed guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2008, FASB issued Staff Position No. APB 14-1 Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial
Cash Settlement FSP 14-1. FSP 14-1 clarifies convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement are not addressed by paragraph 12 of APB Opinion No14, Accounting for
Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants. Additionally, FSP 14-1 specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entitys
nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP 14-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is not permitted. The Company currently has no convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash and, as such, the adoption is not expected to have a significant impact on its financial position and results of operations.
In May 2008, FASB issued SFAS No162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. SFAS No162 identifies the
sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the
United States the GAAP hierarchy. SFAS 162 is effective 60 days following the SECs approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles. The Company believes the adoption of SFAS No162 will not have a significant impact on its financial reporting. NOTE 3. MERIX ASIA ACQUISITION Eastern Pacific Circuits Holdings Limited and Purchase Price Allocation Adjustment 
On September29, 2005, Merix Corporation completed the acquisition of the business operations of Eastern Pacific Circuits Limited and certain of its subsidiaries
collectively referred to as Merix Asia, a Hong Kong based supplier of PCBs from Eastern Pacific Circuits Holdings Limited EPCH. Existing minority interest owners retained, subsequent to completion of the acquisition, their ownership percentage
in the four entities that hold facilities and conduct business operations in the PRC. The individual ownership percentages of these minority interest owners are 5% and 15%, respectively. The acquisition of the business operations of Merix Asia was
completed for an adjusted purchase price of $1168 million. The acquisition was financed with a combination of approximately $328 million of available cash, term loans, including the assumption of certain EPCH debt, and revolving credit borrowings
under two credit facilities totaling approximately $712 million and the issuance of an $110 million subordinated promissory note to EPCH, which was subsequently reduced to $76 million and then again to $25 million, as described below. The
purchase price included $52 million of direct acquisition costs, which were funded with available cash. The term loans and revolving credit borrowings were refinanced in May 2006 see Note 13. The purchase price did not reflect potential
additional consideration based on changes in working capital, cash and an additional earn-out payment of up to $13 million if the business met certain EBITDA targets during the calendar year 2005. During fiscal 2007, the Company and EPCH resolved several uncertainties that existed regarding the application of the post-closing working capital adjustment and EBITDA
earn-out provisions of the purchase agreement. The resolution of these values resulted in a $34 million reduction of the $110 million subordinated promissory note to $76 million. A corresponding reduction of goodwill related to this acquisition
was also recorded. In addition, no payout was made pursuant to the earn-out provisions. The adjustment to the promissory note, combined with final purchase allocation adjustments totaling $14 
66 Table of Contents
million, reduced goodwill resulting from the acquisition by $48 million. In addition, interest expense was recalculated on the note from the date of
inception as if the principal balance was always $76 million, which resulted in a $03 million offset to interest expense in fiscal 2007 to reverse previously recognized interest expense. In fiscal 2008, the Company settled certain claims outstanding against EPCH and made a payment of $25 million to settle all remaining obligations under the subordinated
promissory note. The remaining balance of $51 million outstanding on the subordinated note payable, including accrued interest, was eliminated in exchange for the Company releasing EPCH from all past and any future claims relating to the Merix Asia
acquisition. The $51 million balance including accrued interest was included as a component of gain on settlement of debt on the statement of operations in fiscal 2008. Accounting for Acquisitions In accordance with SFAS No141 Business Combinations, the
Company recorded this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price was allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The excess purchase
price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. The fair values were
based upon a valuation of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, including useful lives, as estimated by management of the Company with the assistance of an independent appraiser. The following summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, prior to the adjustment for the reduction in the subordinated promissory note
and the increase related to the adoption of FIN 48 in thousands:  Current assets 48,328 Property and equipment 46,270 Leasehold land use rights 6,547 Definite-lived identifiable intangible assets 7,268 Goodwill 64,338 Liabilities assumed 52,490 120,261 The acquisition of Merix Asia enabled the Company to better position itself to support its existing customer base,
introduce its technology to new customers in search of a lower-cost solution in Asia, offer a diverse range of products and reduce its overall cost structure. The acquisition also provided the Company with a strategic combination of well-located
manufacturing operations, a seasoned management team and established workforce and an expanded customer base that diversified its end markets, resulting in the recognition of a significant amount of goodwill. Goodwill Impairment See Notes 9 and 17 for additional
information on goodwill and goodwill impairments. Pro Forma Financial Information The following unaudited pro forma financial information, as adjusted for discontinued operations, presents the consolidated results of operations as if this acquisition
had occurred at the beginning of the fiscal year ended May27, 2006 in thousands, except per share amounts:  Net sales 357,631 Net loss 1,458 Basic and diluted net loss per share 007

NOTE 4. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS At May26, 2007, the Companys short-term investments consisted of auction rate securities with a cost basis of $90 million and there was no difference between the aggregate fair value and cost basis of
those investments. During fiscal 2008, the Company liquidated its entire portfolio of auction rate securities. All income generated from short-term
investments is recorded as interest income. There were no realized gains or losses on short-term investments during the fiscal years ended May31, 2008,May26, 2007 or May27, 2006. NOTE 5. INVENTORIES, NET Inventories, net of related reserves,

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE During fiscal 2008, the Company ceased manufacturing operations at its Hong Kong facility. The net book values of the building and
related land use rights were reduced to $0 by an impairment charge recorded in fiscal 2007 see Note 17. These assets are classified as assets held for sale at May31, 2008. In May 2006, the Company decided to sell one of its buildings and two adjacent parcels of land. The building was sold during fiscal 2007, resulting in a gain of approximately $02 million. A portion of the building
was leased back from the seller for a term of 36 months. The gain, therefore, was deferred and is being accreted into income over the life of the lease pursuant to SFAS No28, Accounting for Sales and Leasebacks. In June 2007, the Company disposed of certain equipment as a trade-in on the purchase of new equipment. The used equipment was then leased back from the vendor and the
gain on disposal of $01 million is deferred and recognized over the 20-month term of the leaseback. In accordance with SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company recorded these assets as current assets held for sale. At May31, 2008 and May26, 2007, assets held for sale included the following in thousands:

charges totaling $125 million related to the closure of our Hong Kong and Wood Village facilities. See Note 17 for additional information. In fiscal
2007, the Company recorded a net $11 million asset impairment charge related to discontinued operations and a $266 million asset impairment charge to other assets. See Notes 14 and 17 for additional information. In fiscal 2006, the Company recorded a $05 million asset impairment charge relating to the impairment of long-lived assets held for sale andcertain manufacturing
equipment that was no longer being utilized. NOTE 9. GOODWILL AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill The following is a reconciliation of changes in

its rental obligation. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is required to refurbish certain assets and, accordingly, its remaining asset retirement obligation related to this facility of $09 million was included as a component of other current
liabilities as of May31, 2008. NOTE 13. REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT, LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS $550 Million Revolving Line of Credit During fiscal 2008, the
Company terminated its previous $55 million revolving loan agreement and entered into a new loan and security agreement for a $55 million credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and lender the Credit Facility. Upon
termination of the previous $55 million revolving loan agreement, the Company recognized $05 million in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the terminated credit facility as a component of debt extinguishment costs. The Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculated using the value of accounts receivable, equipment, and real property and is reduced by a reserve for the
$12 million guarantee for the Merix Singapore Revolving Facility Agreement as defined below. The Credit Facility is secured by a lien upon substantially all of the Companys assets, including, without limitation, accounts receivable,
inventory, deposit accounts, intellectual property and real estate, but excluding a portion of the equity securities of Merix foreign subsidiaries owned by Merix or one of its domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest based, at the Companys election, on either the prime rate announced by Bank of America or LIBOR plus an
applicable margin. All amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will be due and payable on February15, 2013. The Credit Facility has usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type, including covenants limiting debt
incurrence, liens, dividends, investments, asset sales, formation of subsidiaries, mergers, restrictive agreements, hedging agreements, affiliate transactions, and material changes in business. The Credit Facility also includes a

financial covenant requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 11:1 if Excess Availability, defined in the Credit Facility agreement as a function of
outstanding borrowings and available cash, falls below $200 million. At May31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants and Excess Availability totaled $440 million. There were no amounts outstanding and there was $550
million available under the Credit Facility at May31, 2008. Merix Singapore Revolving Facility Agreement In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Merix Holding Singapore Pte Ltd MHS entered into a Letter Agreement the Merix Singapore Facility Agreement for a $120 million
credit sub-facility with Bank of America, N.A. as lender. Borrowings under the Merix Singapore Credit Facility will bear interest based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The facility is uncommitted and the lender reserves the right to vary,
reduce, cancel or terminate the facility and require full repayment of amounts outstanding. The Merix Singapore Facility Agreement has an initial term of one year. The Credit Facility and the Merix Singapore Facility Agreement are subject to a
cross-default covenant. As of May31, 2008, there were no amounts outstanding on the Merix Singapore Facility Agreement. Long-Term Debt and
Capital Lease Obligations The Companys outstanding debt at May31, 2008 and May26, 2007 consisted of the following in thousands:
2008
2007
4% Convertible debenture 70,000 70,000
Subordinated note payable 7,594
Capital lease obligations 441 70,000 78,035
Less current maturities 2,532 70,000 75,503 4% Convertible Debenture On May16, 2006, the Company completed the sale of $60 million 4% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013. On May24, 2006, the initial purchaser of these notes exercised its option to purchase an
additional $10 million principal amount, bringing the total gross proceeds to $70 million collectively referred to as the Notes due 2013. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale to:  prepay outstanding Asian revolving loans in the amount of $5 million;  prepay outstanding Asian term loans in the amount of $25 million;  reduce approximately $104 million of outstanding borrowings under domestic revolving loans; and  redeem a $25 million 65% convertible debenture due May 2007. The Asian revolving loans and Asian term loans were prepaid without penalty. The Company incurred a $06 million prepayment penalty as a result of the redemption of the $25 million 65% convertible debenture due May
2007. Upon payment of the outstanding obligations under the Companys Asian revolving loans, Asian term loans and $25 million 65% convertible debenture due May 2007, the underlying agreements were terminated. The Notes due 2013 mature on May15, 2013 and bear interest at the rate of 4%per year. Interest is payable in arrears on May15 and November15 of
each year, beginning on November15, 2006. The Notes due 2013 are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Companys common stock at any time prior to maturity, unless the notes are earlier redeemed or repurchased. The
Notes due 2013 are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 658328 shares per $1,000 principle amount, subject to certain adjustments. This is the equivalent to a conversion price of $1519 per share. The Notes due 2013 are general unsecured
obligations of the Company and are subordinate in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future senior debt and are equal with any future unsecured debt that is not senior debt. 
72 Table of Contents
Embedded Derivatives The Notes due 2013 contain a provision pursuant to which the Company may be required to issue additional shares based on a variable conversion feature if certain events occur. The Company concluded that the debentures are not conventional
convertible debt instruments. In addition, the Company concluded that the embedded conversion option qualifies as a derivative under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Furthermore, in
accordance with EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock, the Company determined that the embedded derivative would be properly classified in equity if
it were a freestanding security due to the following:  it has no net cash settlement feature;  delivery of the shares is within the control of the Company since the settlement shares were registered contemporaneously with the registration of the Notes due
2013;  the Company has sufficient authorized shares to meet the settlement requirements;  the contract has an explicit limit on the number of shares in settlement;  there are no cash payments to the counterparty in the event the Company fails to make timely filings with the SEC;  there are no required cash payments to the counterparty if the shares initially delivered upon settlement are subsequently sold by the counterparty and the sales
proceeds are insufficient to provide the counterparty with full return of the amount due;  there are no provisions in the contract that indicate that the counterparty has rights that rank higher than those of a shareholder of the stock underlying the
contract; and  there is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point or for any reason. Since the Company concluded that the embedded derivative would be properly classified in equity if it were a freestanding security, it was able to further conclude that
the embedded derivative qualifies for the scope exception set forth in SFAS No133, paragraph 11a. Accordingly, the Company is not required to bifurcate and separately account for the embedded derivative. Subordinated Note Payable On September29, 2005, the
Company issued a subordinated Promissory Note the Note to EPCH for a total of a$11 million, plus bthe amount of the earn-out consideration determined under the Master Sale and Purchase Agreement in connection with the acquisition
of Merix Asia see Note 3. The principal was to be paid in four equal installments on March1, 2007,December1, 2007,December1, 2008 and March15, 2009. The outstanding principal balance earned interest at 7%
through December1, 2006, 8% through December1, 2007 and 9% thereafter, payable quarterly. The Company was able to offset its payment obligations under the Note by the amount of warranty claims arising under the Master Sale and Purchase
Agreement. During fiscal 2007, the Company and EPCH resolved several uncertainties that existed regarding the application of the post-closing working
capital adjustment and EBITDA earn-out provisions of the purchase agreement. The resolution of these values resulted in a $34 million reduction of the Note to $76 million. A corresponding reduction of goodwill related to this acquisition was also
recorded. In addition, no payout was made pursuant to the earn-out provisions. In addition, in fiscal 2008, the Company exercised its rights under the
Noteto not make its December1, 2007 payment due to Merix claims against the seller. On January 2008, the Company settled these claims and made a payment of $25 million to settle all remaining obligations under the Note. The
remaining balance of $51 million outstanding on the Note, including accrued interest, was eliminated in exchange for the Company releasing the seller from all past and any future claims relating to the Merix Asia acquisition. The $51 million of
principal and accrued interest that was eliminated are included as a component of gain on settlement of debt on the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2008. The Company does not expect any of the other settlement terms to have a
material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

Capital Lease Obligations Capital lease obligations at May26, 2007 represent financing obligations for machinery and equipment at the Companys Asian facilities. The capital lease obligations are payable in monthly installments of
principal and interest and are collateralized by the related assets financed see Note 15. Principal Payments of Long-Term Debt 
Principal payments of long-term debt of $700 million are due in fiscal 2013. NOTE 14. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September29, 2006, Merix Asia entered into an agreement with Citi-Power Investment Limited
Citi-Power to sell Merix Hong Kongs 90% shareholding interest in the Lomber single-sided manufacturing facility located in Huizhou City in the PRC the Lomber Facility for a nominal amount. Also on September29, 2006, Merix Asia
entered into an agreement with Excel Hero China Limited EXCEL to sell its 8529% shareholding interest in its single-sided manufacturing facility located in Dongguan City in the PRC the Dongguan Facility for a nominal amount. On March31,
2007, Merix Asia sold the stock of Merix Holding Hong Kong Limited, the holding company of the Lomber Facility and Dongguan Facility to East Bridge Group Limited for an amount approximately equal to the book value of the facilities. In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company recorded the related assets and liabilities
as current assets and liabilities on its balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell, upon being classified as discontinued operations. The combined net book value of the Dongguan and Lomber facilities was
approximately $107 million upon their classification as discontinued operations and their fair value, less selling costs was determined to be approximately $120,000. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we recorded an impairment
charge of approximately $126 million, including approximately $03 million of estimated closing costs, as a component of loss from discontinued operations and reversals of a portion of this impairment charge of $158,000 and $37,000, respectively,
were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 based on changes in the net assets to be sold. The results of operations for the Dongguan
and Lomber facilities were reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Certain financial information related to discontinued operations for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 was as follows in thousands:  2007 2006 Revenue 8,597 5,004 Net impairment related to assets of discontinued operations 1,062 Pre-tax loss 470 177

Corporation 2007 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP, which was approved by shareholders, pursuant to which 750,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance to participating employees. Eligible employees may elect to contribute up
to 5% of their gross earnings and may purchase shares only through payroll deductions permitted under the ESPP. The ESPP provides for 6-month offerings commencing on July21 and January21 of each calendar year, or the immediately
preceding business day if these dates occur on a weekend. At the end of each six-month purchase period, the purchase price is determined and the accumulated funds are used to purchase shares of common stock. The purchase price per share is equal to
85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on athe first day of the offering period or bthe date of purchase. The first six-month purchase period ends on July18, 2008 and as such, there were 750,000 shares of
common stock available for issuance under the terms of the ESPP. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan The Company has the Merix Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan, which replaced its 1994 Stock Incentive Plan the 1994 Plan. The 2006 Plan permits the
granting of any or all of the following types of awards: 1incentive and nonqualified stock options, 2stock appreciation rights, 3stock awards, restricted stock and stock units, 4performance shares and performance
units conditioned upon meeting performance criteria and 5other stock- or cash-based awards. Awards may be granted under the 2006 Plan to employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors. Under the
2006 Plan, 750,000 new shares of common stock were reserved for issuance. 396,363 shares of common stock previously reserved for issuance, but not subject to outstanding awards, under the 1994 Plan as of October5, 2006 ceased to be available
for issuance under the 1994 Plan and instead became available for grant under the 2006 Plan. Additionally, shares of common stock subject to outstanding options or unvested restricted stock awards under the 1994Plan will also become available
for grant under the 2006 Plan in the future to the extent that such awards expire or otherwise terminate without shares of common stock being issued pursuant to options, or to the extent that shares issued pursuant to restricted stock awards are
forfeited. As of May31, 2008, approximately 435,000 shares of common stock were subject to outstanding options or unvested stock awards under the 1994 Plan and approximately 918,000 shares had been forfeited or otherwise terminated and became
available for grant under the 2006 Plan. 2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan The Company also has the Merix Corporation 2000 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan that did not require approval by its shareholders. The 2000 Plan, as amended, permits the grant of up to 4,000,000 shares

On January31, 2006,February24, 2006 and July14, 2006, under the terms of the 2000 Plan, the Board
of Directors granted performance-based stock options to the executive officers. Option prices for performance-based stock options are set at the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options vest over a four-year period,
contingent upon the executive officers continued employment with the Company and expire seven years from the date of grant. The performance targets set by the Board of Directors are not expected to be met in subsequent years and, as a result,
the Company is not currently recognizing any expense related to these options. In both plans, a committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to
determine option prices. To date, all options have been granted at or above the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The options vest as determined by the Human Resources Compensation Committee HRCC of the Board of Directors and
generally become exercisable ratably over a four-year period, beginning one year after the date of grant. The options may, in no event, have a term exceeding ten years from the date of grant. On February11, 2008, the Company granted performance-based stock options to certain key employees, 30,000 of which were granted under the terms of the 2006 Plan
and 510,000 of which were granted under the terms of the 2000 Plan. The options vest as to 25% on various dates in October and November 2008 if certain targets are met and as to the remaining 75% in April 2009 if the remaining targets are met. Once
vested, the options will be fully exercisable and will expire seven years from their vest date. The fair value of the performance-based stock options, utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $05 million, a portion of which is being
recognized as an expense over the respective vesting periods based on managements assessment of the probability of achieving the performance targets. At May31, 2008, there were approximately 1,400,000 shares available for grant under the 2000 Plan and the 2006 plan.

Weighted average grant-date per share fair value of shares to be issued under ESPP 245 Total fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP 278 No material amount of share-based compensation was capitalized as a part of an asset during fiscal 2008, 2007 or
2006. There was no tax deduction realized from the exercise of stock options and no tax benefit recognized in the statement of operations related to share-based compensation in fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007. The Company did not recognize a tax benefit
from the share-based compensation expense because it is believed that it was more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets, which have been reduced by a valuation allowance, will not be realized. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company presented any tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options within operating cash
flows in its consolidated statement of cash flows. SFAS No123R requires tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified and reported as both
an operating cash outflow and a financing cash inflow. The excess tax benefits that would otherwise be available to reduce income taxes payable have the effect of increasing the net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, because the Company is
not able to realize these excess tax benefits, such benefits have not been recognized in its consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal 2008 or 2007. The Companys share-based compensation expense was included in its statements of operations for fiscal 2008 and 2007 as follows in thousands:  2008

following weighted average assumptions:  2008 Risk-free interest rate
301 Dividend yield
0 Expected term
6months Volatility
81 The risk-free interest rate used is based on the implied yield on Treasury Constant Maturities with a remaining
term equal to the expected term of the stock option. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has not paid cash dividends in the past and has no expectation of paying dividends in the foreseeable future. The expected term is based on
historical stock option exercise patterns. Expected volatility is calculated based on applying historical volatility over the expected life of the stock options granted. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense using the graded vesting attribution method for stock options and the straight-line attribution method for restricted stock awards over the vesting period of the
individual award with estimated forfeitures considered. Share-based compensation for performance-based stock option awards is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The Company
does not accrue compensation expense if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved. In accordance with SFAS No123R, the Company does not reverse previously recognized compensation expense if vested awards expire
unexercised. The Company issues new shares upon the exercise of stock options. NOTE 17. SEVERANCE, IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES Total severance, impairment and restructuring charges for

operations at its Hong Kong facility, closing the facility and relocating production to other manufacturing facilities. Full closure of the facility was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. This closure was a part of the Companys
actions to consolidate its Asian operations at its lower-cost facilities in China. The Company is also expanding the facilities at its Huiyang plant to increase its manufacturing capacity in China. The Company recorded approximately $14 million in
severance and related costs in connection with closure of the Hong Kong facility, excluding amounts to be paid out to certain employees employed under a continuous contract for not less than five years the Long Service Payment Plan. The Company
expects to receive a total of approximately $23 million, $16 million of which had been received as of May31, 2008, from the Long Service Payment Plan as a refund against the cash restructuring costs.Additionally, the Company recorded
$02 million in asset impairment charges related to the closure of the Hong Kong facility and severance costs totaling $02 million due to other restructuring actions at Merix Asia in fiscal 2008. The Company has paid approximately $15 million in
severance and related costs by the end of fiscal 2008.

Remaining severance costs totaling $01 million are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at
May31, 2008 and are expected to be paid in the first six months of fiscal 2009. Wood Village, Oregon Facility In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company approved a plan to close its manufacturing facility located in Wood Village, Oregon, and relocated production to its
Forest Grove facility. This restructuring action was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Under the plan, the Company transitioned production from its Wood Village facility to its manufacturing facility located in Forest Grove, Oregon.
Overall Oregon inner layer production capacity was reduced by approximately 40% and panel capacity was reduced by approximately 20%. The decision to close the facility was brought about by a number of factors including: athe continued
migration of traditional Merix business to Merix Asia as well as other Asian based competitors; and bcontinued erosion of Merix North American gross margins, believed to result in part from the cyclicality that is part of the PCB
industry. The manufacturing operations of the Wood Village facility were ceased on March1, 2008, and the facility was fully closed in April 2008. The Company incurred charges totaling approximately $135 million in the fiscal 2008 relating to the closure of the Wood Village facility, as well as other restructuring actions, comprising approximately $123 million in asset impairments
and other costs, including lease termination costs and adjustments to the asset retirement obligation accrual for the Wood Village lease, and $12 million in severance payments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company entered into an
agreement to sublease the facility for an amount substantially equal to its rental obligation commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Pursuant to the sublease agreement, the Company is required to refurbish certain assets. Accordingly, the
asset retirement obligation related to this facility of $09 million was included as a component of other current liabilities as of May31, 2008 and all other cash expenses related to this restructuring have been paid. Executive Severance In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the
Company terminated its Executive Vice President of Global Operations. In accordance with the executive employment agreement related to this termination, the Company recorded $04 million of severance and related costs, which were paid in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2007 Severance
charges of $15 million in fiscal 2007 included the following:  a lump-sum cash payment of $06 million and non-cash share-based compensation of $01 million related to the issuance of share-based awards upon the resignation of
our former Chief Executive Officer;  the cost of $01 million for fees related to recruiting a new Chief Executive Officer;  $02 million of cash severance related to the termination of another senior manager of Merix Asia; and  $05 million of cash severance related to the resignation of Merix Asias Chief Executive Officer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $266 million impairment charge related primarily to the property, plant and
equipment and land use rights of its Hong Kong facility, which is part of its Merix Asia operating segment. Due to continuing and forecasted future operating losses, the Company performed an impairment analysis pursuant to SFAS No144. The
Company primarily utilized market value analyses to determine the fair value of the assets. In addition, the $266 million charge included $02 million related to certain assets at the Companys Oregon facility which were determined to have
limited future use. Based on the Companys fourth quarter fiscal 2007 SFAS No142 annual impairment review of the fair value of its Merix San
Jose and Merix Asia operating segment net assets and their related book value, a $533 million charge for goodwill impairment was recorded. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units net assets, the Company utilized a present value of
cash flow projections methodology. The declines in the estimated fair values of the operating segments resulted from lower historical operating 
80 Table of Contents
results than previously anticipated and lower future estimated cash flows. The $533 million charge consisted of a $142 million charge for Merix San Jose
and a $391 million charge for Merix Asia. Fiscal 2006 During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company executed cost reduction actions that included the elimination of approximately 130 employee positions across the Companys manufacturing and support organizations, predominantly in
Oregon. The Company recorded a charge of $07 million related to severance costs and $05 million for the impairment of certain fixed assets. As of May27, 2006, the Company had no accrued liability remaining related to these actions.

Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities at May31, 2008 and May26,
2007 were as follows in thousands:  2008 2007 Deferred tax assets current Inventories 1,856 1,429 Vacation accrual 481 445 Sales allowances 556 648 Other 900 880 3,793 3,402 Deferred tax assets long-term Alternative minimum tax credit 1,130 1,115 Net operating loss carryforwards 21,511 14,591 Qualified research and experimentation credits and other 6,475 5,555 29,116 21,261 Deferred tax liabilities long-term Intangible basis difference 844 1,346 Fixed asset basis difference 359 1,370 Other 461 971 946 3,687 Net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance 31,963 20,976 Valuation allowance 31,003 20,976 960 At May31, 2008, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $408 million, $536
million and $203 million for U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign income tax purposes, respectively. As of May31, 2008, the Company had unused federal and state credit carryforwards of approximately $25 million and $16 million,
respectively. Net operating losses and research and experimentation credits will expire between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2028 and certain state credits may be carried forward indefinitely until exhausted. In addition, the Company had alternative
minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately $11 million, which are available to reduce future federal regular income taxes, if any, over an indefinite period. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income before these carryforwards expire.Included in the federal net operating loss carryforward is $79 million from the exercise of employee stock options, the tax benefit of which, when recognized, will be
accounted for as an increase to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of the income tax provision. A valuation allowance was recorded against
net deferred tax assets due to cumulative losses in recent years and the lack of consistent, positive evidence to support the utilization of net operating losses and other tax attributes against future income. When realization of the deferred tax
asset is more-likely-than-not to occur, the benefit related to the deductible temporary differences attributable to ordinary operations will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. The benefit related to deductible temporary differences
attributable to purchase accounting may result in a reduction to goodwill. The cumulative change in the valuation allowance for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was an increase of approximately $100 million, an increase of approximately $45 million and
an increase of approximately $09 million, respectively.In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we reversed a net $12 million of valuation allowance against certain Merix Asia deferred tax assets.This reversal is reflected on the
consolidated financial statements as a $12 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $05 million decrease to goodwill and a $07 million decrease to tax expense. A subsidiary in China is in a tax holiday effective through December 2009, whereby the applicable statutory rate was zero through December 2006 and subject to a reduced rate of 12% through December 
83 Table of Contents
2009. The impact of the China tax holiday was to increase net income by $05 million $02 per diluted share in fiscal 2008 and $04 million $002 per
diluted share during both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The Company will provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries if foreign
subsidiaries have positive taxable earnings and they are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. The Company indefinitely reinvests the cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. At May31, 2008, the
cumulative earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries was a taxable deficit. We recorded $25 million in potential liability for uncertain tax positions
related to the adoption of FIN 48. This is reflected as a $07 million increase to goodwill and a $18 million charge to beginning accumulated deficit. All of our potential liability for uncertain tax positions would have an impact on the effective
tax rate if recognized. Interest accrued on potential liability for uncertain tax positions was $08 million at May31, 2008. Following is a
rollforward of changes in fiscal 2008 to the Companys potential liability for uncertain tax positions included as a component of other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at May31, 2008 in thousands:  Balance at May26, 2007 
Additions for tax positions taken in prior periods 2,119
Additions for tax positions taken in current period 5
Decreases for lapses in statutes of limitation Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities Balance at May31, 2008 2,124 Net Change 2,124 The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of potential liability for uncertain tax
positions may change within the next 12 months as a result of a pending tax examination but is unable to estimate the amount of the potential change. The
Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties on the potential liability for uncertain tax positions as a component of tax expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. During fiscal 2008, the Company recognized an
additional $04 million in interest and no penalties associated with the potential liability for uncertain tax positions. The Company files income tax
returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to Internal Revenue Service IRS examinations for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2001, state or local examinations
prior to fiscal 2002, and foreign income tax examinations before fiscal year 2001. The Company does not currently have any examinations in process, but has been notified of a pending examination in the PRC for calendar year 2007. NOTE 19. SEGMENT AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE DISCLOSURES The Company has
three reportable business segments defined by geographic location in accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information: 1Merix Oregon, 2Merix San Jose and
3Merix Asia. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and regularly reviewed by senior management. The Companys operating segments are evidence of the internal
structure of its organization. Each segment operates in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar customized products for its customers. The production facilities, sales management and chief decision-makers for all processes
are managed by the same executive team. The Companys chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. Segment disclosures are presented to the gross profit level as this is the primary performance measure for which the segment
managers are responsible. No other

NOTE 20.BENEFIT PLANS Defined Contribution 401k Plans The Company maintains two defined contribution plans that cover all regular U.S.-based employees,
which meet the requirements of Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401k plan for employees that reside in Oregon, the Company matches employee contributions of 100% of the first 3% of an employees base pay and Company
contributions vest at a rate of 25%per year. The Companys contributions may be made in cash or in the Companys stock. Under the 401k plan for employees that reside in California, the Company matches employee contributions of 20%
of the first 15% of an employees base pay and Company contributions vest at a rate of 20%per year after the first year. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, contribution expense for matching contributions in the Companys common stock
totaled $09 million, $12 million and $11 million related to defined contribution 401k plan. Contribution expense for matching contributions paid in cash totaled $06 million, $01 million and $01 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Long Service Payment Plan Under statutory requirement, certain Merix Asia employees are entitled to receive a long service payment if they have been employed under a continuous contract for a period of not less than five years. Upon
termination of employment, the employee is entitled to receive either the long service payment, if eligible, or a severance payment, which are calculated as the lesser of 1the employees last full months wages multiplied by
two-thirds multiplied by the employees total number of service years, or 222,500 Hong Kong dollars approximately U.S. $3,000 at May31, 2008 multiplied by two-thirds multiplied by the employees total number of service
years. The total cumulative severance and long service plan payment are subject to a maximum payment not to exceed 390,000 Hong Kong dollars approximately U.S. $50,000 at May31, 2008. The Companys Long Service Payment Plan accrual, included as a component of other long-term liabilities, at May31, 2008 and May26, 2007 was $32,000 and
$888,000, respectively, and was offset by an unrecognized actuarial gain loss of $6,000 and $149,000, respectively, which was included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, net periodic
pension expense related to this plan was $43,000, $97,000 and $59,000, respectively. Detailed information pursuant to SFAS No87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No132 Revised 2003, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, is not provided due to the immateriality of the defined benefit pension amounts. The Companys liability under the Long Service Plan was significantly reduced due to the
closure of the Hong Kong facility during fiscal 2008. In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the accrual for the Long Service Payment Plan was reduced by
$14 million with a corresponding reduction to goodwill based on an estimate prepared by an outside actuary see also Note 3. The Company engaged an outside actuary to calculate the liability in accordance with SFAS No87,
Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plansan amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106, and 132R.
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan During
fiscal 2007, Merix implemented an executive deferred compensation plan. Pursuant to the plan, certain management employees are eligible to defer up to 75% of their regular salary and 100% of their annual bonus. Each plan participant is fully vested
in all deferred compensation and credited earnings. The liability for the plan was $02 million and $01 million, respectively, at May31, 2008 and May26, 2007. Expense related to this plan was not significant in fiscal 2008 or 2007.

NOTE 21.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation The Company is, from time to time, made subject to various legal claims, actions and complaints in
the ordinary course of its business. Except as disclosed below, the Company believes that the outcome of the litigation should not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Securities Class Action Four purported class action
complaints were filed against the Company and certain of its executive officers and directors in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The complaints were consolidated in a single action entitled In re Merix Corporation Securities Litigation,
Lead Case No. CV 04-826-MO, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. After the court granted the Companys motion to dismiss without prejudice, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. That complaint alleged that the
defendants violated the federal securities laws by making certain inaccurate and misleading statements in the prospectus used in connection with the January 2004 public offering of approximately $1034 million of the Companys common stock. In
September 2006, the Court dismissed that complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In April 2008, the Ninth Circuit reversed the dismissal of the Second Amended Complaint. The Company sought rehearing
which was denied and rehearing en banc which was also denied. The Company obtained a stay of the mandate from the Ninth Circuit and will file a certiorari petition with the United States Supreme Court by September22, 2008. The plaintiffs seek
unspecified damages. A potential loss or range of loss that could arise from these cases is not estimable or probable at this time. Breach of Contract
Complaint In June 2008, a complaint was filed against Merix Caymans Trading Company Ltd. by Clark Sales, LLC, Case No2:08-CV-12551-MOR-VMM, in
the United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan. The complaint alleges breach of contract in relation to payment of post-termination commissions. The plaintiffs seek damages in excess of $4 million. The Company believes that the court
has no jurisdiction to hear the claim and that the claims have no merit and, as such, has not recorded a liability for potential loss. A hearing is scheduled for October31, 2008. Environmental Matters The process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to environmental regulations
regarding the storage, use, labeling and handling of and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes and other hazardous materials as well as air quality standards applicable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The Companys Huiyang and
Huizhou facilities in China are not currently compliant with all applicable environmental permits and requirements. The Company has worked cooperatively with regulators in China and has agreed upon a compliance plan and anticipates that this plan,
if executed, would not result in any fines, penalties or unplanned costs. In fiscal 2008 and 2007, the Company incurred $03 and $08 million, respectively, of environmental compliance costs relating to the Hiuzhou and Huiyang facilities. The
Company anticipates incurring a total of approximately $06 million in fiscal 2009 for compliance costs. Third-Party Indemnification In the normal course of business, the Company indemnifies customers with respect to certain matters. The Company has agreed, under certain conditions, to hold these third
parties harmless against specified losses, such as those arising from other third party claims that the Companys products, when used for their intended purposes, infringe the intellectual property rights of such other third parties. To date,
the Company has not recorded any material charges related to these types of indemnifications. Commitments As of May31, 2008, the Company had capital commitments of approximately $67 million, primarily relating to the purchase of manufacturing equipment. The Company
also had consignment agreements 
87 Table of Contents
with certain suppliers for raw material inventory, some of which obligate the Company to purchase inventory on hand upon termination of the agreement. As of
May31, 2008, potential commitments under these agreements were insignificant. NOTE 22.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company recorded the following amounts for transactions with Huizhou Desay Holdings Co. Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, a minority shareholder of two Merix Asia

A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In connection with managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of May26,
2007, we identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which has not been fully remediated as of May31, 2008: Merix Asia was acquired in September 2005. Upon acquisition, Merix Asia had weak internal controls over financial reporting and needed to develop processes to strengthen its accounting systems and control environment management. We have
devoted significant time and resources to improving the internal controls over financial reporting since the acquisition. However, Merix management did not maintain sufficient controls to adequately monitor the accounting and financial reporting of
our Merix Asia operations. This material weakness resulted in adjustments to our 2007 annual consolidated financial statements that were identified by management and our external auditors. Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a
material misstatement to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.
Remediation Steps to Address Material Weakness Because of the material weakness identified in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, we performed and plan to perform additional steps to enhance internal control over financial reporting. Our procedures include, but
were not limited to, the following:  We continue to work toward the implementation of our global ERP system for our Asia operations, anticipated to occur during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The
new ERP system will allow for greater consistency of accounting processes and internal controls between our US and Asia operations and it will give us greater visibility into the accounting records and accounting practices in Merix Asia.
We have performed physical inventory counts at our Asia locations at each quarter-end during fiscal 2008 and will continue to do so until our global ERP system is
in place for our Asia operations.  We have devoted time and resources to implement and improve the cost accounting systems for Merix Asia and to strengthen our analytical procedures focused on trends
and variance analysis to budgets and forecasts. In fiscal 2008, we implemented detailed periodic reviews of the results of Merix Asia with follow-up actions to improve the control currently in place. These reviews provide for more formal
communication processes related to the financial statement adjustments and changes in the internal control environment.  We have invested significant amounts of time and expense on training for financial personnel in Asia and in the US. We have also commenced more frequent oversight
trips to Asia.  We continue to reaffirm a message that compliance with our controls over financial reporting is extremely important and will continue to impress that throughout our
company.  We have realigned our organizational structure across the company along functional lines. We believe this has resulted in more accountability across the
organization and allows for sharing of best practices across all functions, improving the internal control environment. Despite the
significant improvement of internal controls over financial reporting related to our Merix Asia operations, management believes that the material weakness will not be sufficiently remediated prior to the implementation of the global ERP system for
our Asia operations. Additional remediation and controls testing will be undertaken subsequent to the ERP system implementation in Asia during fiscal 2009. Based on our assessment and as a result of the material weakness described above, our management concluded that, as of May31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May31, 2008 has been audited by Grant
Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their attestation report is set forth in ebelow in this Item9A. c Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can
be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The
design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions;
over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to
error or fraud may occur and not be detected. d Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting, except as follows: Material Weakness and Remediation Steps
After considering the errors that were detected by our internal control testing and as part of our closing process related to the reporting of the
quarterly results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, management concluded that a material weakness existed in our internal control as of March1, 2008. Specifically, we did not maintain adequate controls over the reconciliation of
inter-company accounts and certain work in process inventories. In addition, as of March1, 2008, we had not remediated a previously identified material weakness relating to the processing and recording of transactions related to customer
returns of products for warranty rework or credit. During the fiscal quarter ended May31, 2008, we took actions to remediate the material weakness
related to the reconciliation of inter-company accounts and certain work in process inventories. Among other controls we have implemented is a change in the process and documentation required to complete an account reconciliation. In addition, we
are including historical account trend and activity information to assist both the preparer and reviewer in analyzing the reasonableness of the account balance in relation to prior periods. We also initiated a more robust monthly account balance
review process to be led by senior finance personnel and accounting management. The controls implemented to remediate material weaknesses related to controls over the processing and recording of transactions related to customer returns of products
for warranty rework or credit and controls over the reconciliation of inter-company accounts and certain work-in-process inventories were determined to be operating effectively at May31, 2008.

e Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Merix Corporation We have audited Merix Corporationss internal control over financial reporting as of May31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Merix Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Merix
Corporations internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a
control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment: The Company did not maintain sufficient controls to adequately monitor the accounting and financial reporting of the Merix Asia operations. This material weakness resulted in adjustments to the Companys 2008 annual consolidated
financial statements that were identified by management and the external auditors. Additionally, this control deficiency could result in a material misstatement to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented
or detected. Accordingly, management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness.

In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of
the control criteria, Merix Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May31, 2008 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Merix
Corporation and subsidiaries as of May31, 2008 and May26, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, statements of shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and statements of cash flows for the years
ended May31, 2008 and May26, 2007. The material weakness identified above was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2008 financial statements, and this report does not affect
our report dated August6, 2008, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Portland, Oregon August 6, 2008  Item1.
