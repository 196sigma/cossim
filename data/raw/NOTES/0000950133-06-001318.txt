Item8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting We, as members of management of LCC International, Inc. the
Company, are responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and 15d-15f under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed by or
under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance to the
Companys management and board of directors regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company     
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company;and     
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the companys assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. We assessed the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in
Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
identified the following material weakness in the Companys
internal control as of December31, 2005   
The Company did not have effective policies and procedures
related to accounting for fixed-price customer contracts
accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion
method. Specifically, there was not an effective review of the
performance status of fixed-price contracts by personnel with
sufficient technical expertise related to accounting for
contracts under the
percentage-of-completion
method. As a result, material misstatements were identified in
revenues and cost of revenues in the Companys preliminary
2005 consolidated financial statements. Such misstatements were
corrected prior to the issuance of the 2005 consolidated
financial statements. Because of the material weakness described above, management
concluded that the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December31,
2005. The Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on our assessment of
the companys internal control over financial reporting,
included in Item8. 42 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that LCC International, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005,
because of the effect of the material weakness identified in
managements assessment, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment as of December31, 2005   
The Company did not have effective policies and procedures
related to accounting for fixed-price customer contracts
accounted for under the
percentage-of-completion
method. Specifically, there was not an effective review of the
performance status of fixed-price contracts by personnel with
sufficient technical expertise related to accounting for
contracts under the
percentage-of-completion
method. As a result, material misstatements were identified in
revenues and cost of revenues in the Companys preliminary
2005 consolidated financial statements. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of LCC International, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2005. 43 The aforementioned material weakness was considered in
determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests
applied in our audit of the 2005 consolidated financial
statements, and this report does not affect our report dated
March15, 2006, which expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the
Company did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. KPMG LLP McLean, Virginia March15, 2006 44 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and comprehensive loss,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December31, 2005. In connection with our audits of
the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited
financial statement ScheduleII. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of LCC International, Inc. and subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March15,
2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements
assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation
of, internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP McLean, Virginia March15, 2006 45 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 In thousands, except per share data

In May 2003, in satisfaction of the purchase agreement between
Westminster Capital, B.V. Westminster and our
company, we paid Westminster approximately $03million in
cash and assigned an intercompany note receivable due from
Detron to Westminster in the amount of approximately
$02million. As a result of the note assignment, goodwill
and other intangible assets increased, offset by an increase in
due to related parties, which is included in accounts payable on
the consolidated balance sheet.     
In December 2004, we purchased 159,209shares of our
ClassA common stock from our Chief Executive Officer for a
per share price of $554 recording treasury stock of
approximately $09million. We concurrently applied the
same amount in satisfaction of approximately $09million
of his note outstanding to us. The remaining balance on the note
of approximately $07million was deemed discharged, and is
recorded above as non-cash compensation. 50 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005

Description of Operations LCC International Inc. a Delaware Corporation
LCCI, was formed in 1983. Unless the context
indicates otherwise, the terms the Company,
we, us, and our refer herein
to LCCI. We provide integrated
end-to-end solutions
for wireless voice and data communication networks with service
offerings ranging from high level technical consulting, to
system design and deployment, to ongoing operations and
maintenance services. We operate in a highly competitive
environment subject to rapid technological change and emergence
of new technologies. Historically, the key drivers of changes in
our wireless services business have been 1the issuance
of new or additional licenses to wireless service providers;
2the introduction of new services or technologies;
3increases in the number of subscribers served by
wireless service providers, the increase in usage by those
subscribers and the scarcity of wireless spectrum; and
4the increasing complexity of wireless systems in
operation. Although we believe that our services are
transferable to emerging technologies, rapid changes in
technology and deployment could have an adverse financial impact
on us.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.   
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less and include
overnight repurchase agreements, short-term notes, and
short-term money market funds.   
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose us to
concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade
receivables. We sell our services globally. Generally, we do not
require collateral or other security to support customer
receivables. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our
customers financial condition and maintain a provision for
doubtful accounts related to potential credit losses. We had the
following significant concentrations of trade receivables from
customers located outside the United States at December31,
2004 and 2005

Our existing and potential customer base is diverse and includes
start-up companies and
foreign enterprises. We derived approximately 729%, 812% and
811% of our revenues from our ten largest customers for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
These ten largest customers constituted 812%, 733% and 707%
of our net receivable balance as of December31, 2003, 2004
and 2005, respectively. Although we believe that the diversity
of our customer base has historically minimized the risk of
incurring material losses due to concentrations of credit risk,
we may be exposed to a declining customer base in periods of
market downturns, severe competition, exchange rate fluctuations
or other international developments. 51 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In 2005, revenues from one customer were approximately
$365million or 188% of total revenues and revenues from
another customer were approximately $312million or 161%
of total revenues and revenues from a third customer were
approximately $311million or 160% of total revenues. In
2004, revenues from one customer were approximately
$398million or 206% of total revenues, revenues from
another customer were approximately $377million or 195%
of total revenues. In 2003, revenues from one customer were
approximately $165million or 152% of total revenues and
revenues from another customer were $130million or 120%
of total revenues and revenues from a third customer were
approximately $115million or 106% of total revenues.   
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, receivables, restricted cash, accrued
expenses, and accounts payable, approximated fair value as of
December31, 2004 and 2005 because of the relatively short
duration of these instruments. The carrying value of the line of
credit approximated the fair value as the instrument included a
market rate of interest.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost, less an allowance for
depreciation. Replacements and major improvements are
capitalized; maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets per the table
below.   
Computer equipment
3years   
Software
3years   
Furniture and office equipment
3 to 7years   
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of the term of the lease or estimated useful life   
Vehicles
5years   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Our policy is to review our long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance
with SFASNo144, Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We recognize an impairment
loss when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The measurement
of the impairment losses to be recognized is based upon the
difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the
assets.   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of
assets of businesses acquired. We adopted the provisions of
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, as of January1, 2002. Goodwill and intangible
assets acquired in a purchase business combination and
determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized,
but instead tested for impairment at least annually in
accordance with the provisions of SFASNo142.
SFASNo142 also requires that intangible assets with
estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with
SFASNo144. 52 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Investments in Affiliates We use the equity method to account for those investments in
which we have an ownership interest equal to or greater than 20%
or exercise significant influence. For equity method
investments, we record our proportionate share of the
investees net income or loss. Generally, we use the cost
method of accounting for our investments in which we have an
ownership interest of less than 20% and do not exercise
significant influence. Investments carried at cost are written
down if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
investment may not be recoverable.   
Revenue Recognition Our principal sources of revenues are design services and system
deployment services. We recognize revenues from long-term
fixed-price contracts using the
percentage-of-completion
method. With the
percentage-of-completion
method, we recognize revenue based on the ratio of individual
contract costs incurred to date on a project compared with total
estimated contract costs. We compare costs incurred to date to
progress achieved against project milestones to determine if the
percentage of completion is reasonable. Anticipated contract
losses are recognized as soon as they become known and
estimable. We also recognize revenues on time and materials
contracts as the services are performed. Revenues earned but not
yet billed are reflected as unbilled receivables in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We expect
substantially all unbilled and billed receivables to be
collected within one year.   
Income Taxes Income taxes are determined in accordance with
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under this statement, temporary differences
arise as a result of the differences between the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the
opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects
of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. Certain of our international operations are subject to local
income taxation. Currently, we are subject to taxation on income
from certain operations in Europe, Latin America, the Far East,
the Middle East and the
non-U.S.portions
of North America where we have subsidiaries, have established
branch offices or have performed significant services that
constitute a permanent establishment for tax
reporting purposes. The foreign taxes paid or accrued by us may
represent a potential credit for us against our
U.S.federal income taxes.   
Foreign Currency Translation Gains and losses on translation of the accounts of our foreign
operations where the local currency is the functional currency
are accumulated and included in other accumulated comprehensive
income loss within the accompanying consolidated statement of
shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are recognized currently in the consolidated
statements of operations.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates
are used in accounting for, among other things, long-term
contracts, allowance for doubtful accounts, accrual of income
taxes, recoverability of investments in affiliates and the
accrual of restructuring charges. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 53 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Stock-Based Compensation We account for equity-based compensation arrangements in
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations
including FASB Interpretation No44, and comply with the
disclosure provisions of SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. All
equity-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their
fair value in accordance with SFASNo123. Under APB
No25, compensation expense is based upon the difference,
if any, on the date of grant, between the fair value of our
stock and the exercise price. Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans and
employee stock purchase plan been determined on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards under those plans, consistent with
SFASNo123, our net loss and net loss per share
would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated

Other Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss is defined as net income plus the
changes in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. Other comprehensive income refers to revenues,
expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted
accounting principles are included in comprehensive income, but
excluded from net income. Other comprehensive income loss
consists solely of foreign currency translation adjustments in
2003, 2004 and 2005. Changes in components of other
comprehensive income loss are reported net of income tax, as

Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the
FASB issued a revision of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, Share-Based
Payment SFASNo123R. This
statement will require compensation costs related to share-based
payment transactions to be recognized in the financial
statements. SFASNo123R replaces FASB Statement
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. We 54 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued currently account for share-based compensation to employees
using APB Opinion 25s intrinsic value method and recognize
no compensation cost for employee stock options. Upon our
adoption of SFAS123R on January1, 2006, we will
begin recognizing an expense for unvested share-based
compensation that has been issued as of January1, 2006 and
equity instruments issued after that date. The adoption of
SFASNo123Rs fair value method will have a
significant impact on our results of operations and the
classification of certain cash flows. We do not expect the
adoption of SFASNo123R to have a significant impact
on our financial position. The ultimate impact of the adoption
of SFASNo123R can not be predicted at this time
because it will be dependent on levels of share-based
compensation granted in the future. However, valuation of
employee stock options under SFASNo123R is similar
to SFASNo123 with minor exceptions. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections
SFASNo154 which replaces Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No20 Accounting
Changes and SFASNo3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements-An Amendment
of APB Opinion No28. SFAS154 applies to
all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes
required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance
that the pronouncement does not include specific transition
provisions. It establishes retrospective application, or the
latest practicable date, as the required method for reporting a
change in accounting principle. SFASNo154 is
effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made
in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005 and,
accordingly, is required to be adopted by us on January1,
2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFASNo154
will have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations and financial position.

Accounts Receivable We are party to various long term contracts for which revenues
are recognized on the percentage of completion method. Certain
of these contracts have large amounts of unbilled receivables
associated with them and will be performed over a period of more
than twelve months. As of December31, 2004 and 2005 we had
$08million and $13million billed but not paid by
customers under retainage provisions in contracts. We had
$187million and $268million billed and
$69million and $133million unbilled but
anticipated to be billed within one year. We expect certain of
the retainages to be collected after one year. During 2003, we received $21million from a customer in
Algeria that had been previously reserved during 2002. The
amount was recorded as a recovery of bad debt and as a reduction
in general and administrative expense.

Restructuring Charge During 2002, we adopted a restructuring plan and recorded a
restructuring charge of $135million. The restructuring
plan was in response to the low utilization of professional
employees caused by the completion of several large fixed-price
contracts and the difficulty in obtaining new contracts as a
result of the slowdown in wireless telecommunications
infrastructure spending. The cost of the severance and
associated expenses was approximately $10million and
resulted in a work force reduction of approximately 140 people.
In addition, we had excess facility costs. In our London office,
30 employees were occupying 8,600square feet. Once the
number of employees declined to10, with consolidation to
one of the five levels of the facility, it became apparent that
the remainder of the space could not be utilized. There was no
anticipated future use for the space by the company given its
then current business projections. There was no incentive for
the landlord to modify the lease as the real estate market in
the surrounding area was soft and current rental rates were
below those we were committed to. In the McLean, Virginia
office, space requirements diminished due to the sale of our
products division, a reduction in force and the trend for our
employees to work on site with our customers. As in London,
McLean was committed to lease the whole building. From
approximately 155,000square feet, we determined that
approximately 40,000 were required. There was no anticipated
future use of the space based on the then current business
projections. There was no incentive for the landlord to modify
the lease as the real estate market in the surrounding area was
soft and current rental rates were below those we were committed
to. The charge for the excess office space was approximately
$125million, which included $20million in
written-off leasehold improvements and other assets related to
the excess space. The facility charge equals the existing lease
obligation, less the anticipated rental receipts to be received
from existing and potential subleases. This charge required
significant judgments about the length of time that space will
remain vacant, anticipated cost escalators and operating costs
associated with the leases, market rate of the subleased space,
and broker fees or other costs necessary to market the space. As
of December31, 2005, the restructuring charge calculation
assumes we will receive $83million in sublease income, of
which $67million is committed. During the first quarter of 2003, we reversed excess severance
payable of approximately $02million. During the third
quarter of 2003, we reoccupied a portion of our office space in
McLean, Virginia and reversed $04million of the payable
and recorded an increase in the restructuring payable of
$05million related to an estimated increase in the time
period expected to sublease space in our London office. During the second and fourth quarters of 2004, we reversed
$09million and $03million, respectively of the
payable due to reoccupied office space in McLean, Virginia and a
decrease in the estimated time period expected to sublease space
in our McLean and London offices. Our initial charge for London
was based on our lease commitment offset by our projected
sublease income. Subsequently, we secured a tenant both in
advance of our projections and at more favorable lease terms,
causing a recovery of $06million. Our initial charge for
McLean was based on our lease commitment offset by our projected
sublease income. Subsequently, after unsuccessful lease
attempts, we determined that approximately 2,000square
feet was unlikely to be leased due to its configuration. It was
determined that additional space was needed to accommodate two
new business ventures. Therefore, we reoccupied one wing on a
floor approximately 8,000square feet, resulting in a
recovery of approximately $06million. While there was
significant internal effort involved, the cost of reoccupying
the McLean space was limited to the time incurred by internal
facilities employees. During the second quarter of 2005, we adopted a restructuring
plan and recorded a net restructuring charge of
$08million. Included in the restructuring charge was
$08million for severance related to the elimination of 48
positions in Corporate, North America and Asia Pacific. An
additional $01million was related to costs associated
with closing facilities and disposing of assets. Because we
reoccupied some of the leased office space that had previously
been included in the reserve for restructuring in a prior
period, the reserve was reduced by $02million in the
second quarter of 2005. In the fourth quarter, we reduced the
restructuring reserve by approximately $01million due to
a recovery of sublease income. 56 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Investments As of the end of 2005, the Company has no further investments. We held 1,666,666shares of ClassB Common Stock of
NextWave Telecom, Inc. NextWave Telecom which is
the parent corporation of NextWave Personal Communications Inc.
We acquired the shares of NextWave Telecom in May 1996 for a
purchase price of $50million in connection with a series
of transactions entered into between NextWave Telecom and us
under an agreement dated March12, 1996 the March
Agreement. We also acquired warrants to purchase an
additional 123,356shares of ClassB Common Stock of
NextWave Telecom at $300per share. Under the March
Agreement, NextWave Telecom agreed to engage us to provide not
less than a$140million of radio frequency
engineering services and b$350million of system
deployment services. These services were to be provided in
increments of twenty percent 20% each year during the
five-year period following the execution of the March Agreement.
NextWave Telecom filed for bankruptcy protection on
December23, 1998. The March Agreement was rejected by
NextWave Telecom upon confirmation of its bankruptcy plan on
March2, 2005. On March23, 2005, we agreed to settle
our rejection damages claims against NextWave Telecom by
executing a Network Deployment Agreement whereby NextWave
Telecom agreed to engage us to perform $300million of
radio frequency engineering and system deployment services over
three years in future markets, commencing with Las Vegas. In the
second quarter of 2005, the Company also received a cash payment
of approximately $06million from NextWave for the
exercise of all warrants held by the Company. The exercise was
made in accordance with the terms of NextWaves
reorganization plan under bankruptcy proceedings On August4, 2003 we, through our wholly owned subsidiary
LCC China Services, L.L.C., closed an investment in a newly
created entity based in China, Beijing, LCC Bright Oceans
Communication Consulting Co. Ltd. LCC/BOCO. We
contributed approximately $11million for a 490% share of
LCC/BOCOs registered capital. Bright Oceans Inter-Telecom
Corporation, a Chinese publicly traded network management and
systems integrator BOCO, contributed approximately
$11million to hold the remaining 510% of LCC/BOCOs
registered capital. We account for the investment in LCC/BOCO using the equity
method of accounting. We recorded an equity loss of
$01million to reflect our proportionate share of
LCC/BOCOs losses through March31, 2004, and an
additional equity loss of $02million in the second
quarter of 2004 and an additional $01million in 2005, all
of which are recorded in other expense. BOCO advised us that it
made a strategic decision to exit the wireless
telecommunications infrastructure services business and we
agreed to dissolve the joint venture. We transferred selected
projects and joint venture employees to our wholly-owned Chinese
subsidiary, which continues to pursue projects independently
with customers in China. In the fourth quarter 2005, LCC
dissolved the joint venture. At December31, 2005 we have
recorded the distribution of the assets and cash remaining in
the joint venture, resulting in a net receivable of
approximately $04million recorded in other receivables. In April 2003, we formed LCC Wireless Communications Espana S.A.
LCC Espana, as a subsidiary organized under the
laws of Spain. At the time of formation, 30% of the equity
shares of LCC Espana were owned by an unaffiliated local
construction firm, Insyte Instalaciones, S.A.
Insyte. In late September 58 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 2004, we redeemed Insytes interest in LCC Espana in
consideration for approximately $17,000 in payments to Insyte.
As a result, LCC Espana became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
company.   
7
Business Combinations On July9, 2002, we acquired 51% of the outstanding shares
of Detron LCC Network Services B.V., or Detron, a newly formed
corporation organized under the laws of the Netherlands.
Westminster Capital B.V. Westminster which
transferred the remaining 49% of the shares to Detron
Corporation B.V. successor to Westminster. On June1,
2005, LCC United Kingdom Limited LCC UK, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, exercised its option to
purchase from Detron the remaining 49% interest in the share
capital of LCC Detron. LCC UK paid approximately $246,000 for
the 49% interest which included a purchase price of
approximately $126,000 plus $121,000 in management fees. In
addition, the share purchase agreement for the additional
interest included the requirement that LCC Detron repay Detron
approximately $529,000 in outstanding loans made to LCC Detron.
LCC UK currently owns 100% of LCC Detron. The acquisition has been recorded under the purchase method of
accounting, and therefore Detrons results have been
included in the consolidated financial statements since the date
of acquisition. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition amounted
to $25million. Other intangible assets acquired amounted
to $05million. Other intangible assets, including
backlog, customer relationships, and the Detron trade name, are
amortized over two to five years depending on the estimated
remaining useful lives. Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives were
evaluated at December31, 2004 and 2005 for possible
impairment under the provisions of SFASNo142. We
concluded that no adjustment was necessary at year-end and will
continue to evaluate for possible impairment annually. We recognized $03million and $02million in
amortization expense for the intangible assets, for the years
ended December31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We expect
amortization expense on the acquired intangible assets to be as

Line of Credit In 2003, Detron established a line of credit with NMB-Heller
N.V. NMB. The line of credit provides that NMB
will provide credit to Detron in the form of advance payments
collateralized by Detrons outstanding receivables. The
agreement provides for NMB to advance up to 75% of the
receivable balance. 59 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued There is no maximum on the amount of receivables Detron can
assign to NMB. Detron must repay the advances from NMB within
90days or upon customer payment whichever occurs first.
Interest on the advance payments will be calculated at a rate
equal to NMBs overdraft base rate plus 2%subject to
a minimum of 575%per year. The agreement has an initial
term of two years and can be extended. As of December31,
2003 and 2004 Detron had $18million and $01million
outstanding under the credit facility at an interest rate of
575%. This line of credit was terminated in the first quarter
of 2005. On July18, 2005, the Company, and Commerce Funding
Corporation CFC entered into an Assignment and
Transfer of Receivables Agreement the Agreement
pursuant to which the Company may elect to transfer certain of
its accounts receivable to CFC in exchange for cash. At the same
time, the Company, LCC Wireless Design Services, LLC a
subsidiary of the Company and CFC entered into a Fee Agreement
and each also entered into a General Continuing Guaranty
Agreement together collectively referred to as the
Financing Documents. Under the Financing Documents, each of the Company and LCC
Wireless Design Services, LLC may from time to time transfer to
CFC in exchange for cash certain of its accounts receivable to
be specified in its request. CFC has the right to determine in
its sole discretion the amount of cash, if any, it is willing to
advance with respect to any specified account receivable, which
amount shall not exceed 80% of the face amount of the
receivables presented. Any advances made by CFC under the
Agreement are due and payable on demand. Under the original
terms of the Agreement, the aggregate amount owed to CFC by the
Company and LCC Wireless Design Services, LLC at any time may
not exceed $3,000,000. In the event any transferred account
receivable remains unpaid for the earlier of 90days from
the date funds were advanced by CFC on that receivable or
120days from the original invoice date, the Company or LCC
Wireless Design Services, LLC , as the case may be, shall
substitute an account receivable of equal or greater value for
the unpaid account receivable or buy back the unpaid account
receivable from CFC. Outstanding advances will bear interest at
the prime rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal. CFC shall
be entitled to various fees under the Financing Documents,
including initially a monthly administrative fee of $22,500.
Each of the Company and LCC Wireless Design Services, LLC has
guaranteed to CFC the performance of the others
obligations under the Financing Documents and has pledged to CFC
its respective accounts receivables from some of its customers
to secure its respective obligations under the Financing
Documents. The initial term of the Agreement was three months, with
automatic term renewals for successive one-month periods unless
cancelled by the Company or LCC Wireless Design Services, LLC
thirty days prior to the last day of any term. In addition,
either the Company and LCC Wireless Design Services, LLC or CFC
may terminate the arrangement upon thirty days prior written
notice and CFC may terminate the arrangement at any time
following the occurrence of certain defined events of default or
if the Company or LCC Wireless Design Services, LLC do not
request any advances for a period of 90 consecutive days. On
October18, 2005, the Company extended the Agreement until
November17, 2005. On November17, 2005, the Company
extended the Agreement until December19, 2005. On
December13, 2005, the Company extended the Agreement until
January20, 2006. On January20, 2006, the Company
extended the Agreement until February20, 2006. On
February7, 2006, the Company extended the Agreement until
March7, 2006. On March15, 2006, the Company signed
an amendment to the Fee Agreement that extended the term of the
agreement for twelve months until March16, 2007. The term
shall automatically renew for successive twelve months unless
cancelled by the Company 30days prior to the end of the
term. In the event the Company terminates the Fee Agreement
before the expiration the term, the Company shall pay a
termination fee of $50,000. On September14, 2005, the Financing Documents were amended
to increase the maximum amount which the Company may owe to CFC
by an additional $1,000,000 for a total of $4,000,000. The terms
and conditions were the same as provided for in the original Fee
Agreement except that the monthly administration fee increased
from $22,500 to $30,000. On February13, 2006, the
Financing Documents were amended to 60 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued increase the maximum amount which the Company may owe to CFC by
an additional amount of $1,000,000 for a total of $5,000,000.
The Terms and Conditions were the same as provided for in the
amended Fee Agreement except that the monthly administration fee
increased from $30,000 to $37,000. Advances made to the Company or LCC Wireless Design Services,
LLC have been utilized for working capital purposes, including
the payment of amounts owed to subcontractors under certain

62 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued At December31, 2005, we had foreign tax credit
carryforward for U.S.tax purposes of $05million,
which expire between 2009 and 2010, a research and development
credit of $03million, and an alternative minimum tax
credit carryover of $03million. We had
U.S.operating loss carry-forwards of $265million
which expire beginning in 2023. We also had $239million
of foreign net operating loss carry-forwards, some of which
expire beginning in 2006 and some of which can be carried
forward indefinitely, subject to certain restrictions. Foreign income tax expense is generated from business conducted
in countries where we have subsidiaries or have established
branch offices or have performed significant services that
constitute a permanent establishment for tax
reporting purposes. In determining the tax valuation allowances, management
considers whether it is likely that some portion of the deferred
tax assets will be realized. Based on our financial results for
the year ended December31, 2005, projected future taxable
income and tax planning strategies, we increased our valuation
allowance on foreign and domestic net operating loss carry
forwards and other deferred tax assets by $33million. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
when the benefit remains available and in those countries where
the assets can be used. We consider the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Except for $02million of foreign withholding tax, no
provision was made in 2005 for United States income taxes or
foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of the
foreign subsidiaries, as it is the Companys intention to
utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an
indefinite period of time or to repatriate such earnings only
when tax effective to do so. It is not practicable to determine
the amount of income or withholding tax that would be payable
upon the remittance of those earnings. The company does not
believe that repatriating the undistributed earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries would have a material tax effect.   
10
Health and Retirement Plans We have a defined contribution profit sharing plan under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code that provides
for voluntary employee contributions of 10% to 60% of
compensation for substantially all employees. We make a matching
contribution of 500% of an employees contribution up to
60% of each employees compensation. Company contributions
and other expenses associated with the plan were approximately
$04million, $04million, and $03million for
the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005,
respectively. Our subsidiary, LCC UK Ltd., has a defined contribution pension
plan under Chapter1 PartXIV of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act, 1988. The plan provides for voluntary
employee contributions of 10% to 50% of an employees
base salary. It is available to all full-time employees who have
completed their three-month probation period. We contribute 50%
of an employees base salary and match the employees
contribution up to 50%. LCC UK Ltd., contributions and other
expenses related to the plan were approximately
$01million for each of the years ended December31,
2003, 2004 and 2005. Our subsidiary, LCC Deployment Services UK Ltd., has a defined
contribution pension plan under Chapter1 PartXIV of
the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1988. The plan provides
for voluntary employee contributions of 40% of an
employees base salary. It is available to all full-time
employees who have completed their three-month probation period.
We contribute 80% of an employees base salary.
Contributions and other expenses related to the plan were
approximately $02million for each of the years ended
December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. 63 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Our subsidiary, LCC Italia has two statutory defined
contribution pension plans and one voluntary plan for directors
of LCC Italia. The contributions are in accordance with the
National Contract Agreement. LCC Italia contributions and
related expenses to the plans were approximately
$09million, $08million and $12million for
the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005
respectively. Our subsidiary, Detron has pension plans in accordance with
statutory labor agreements. In 2004 and 2005, Detron was under
the Kleinmetaal labor agreement. This agreement provides that
all employees over the age of twenty-five and the employer are
obliged to contribute to an Old-age Scheme and to a Pre-pension
Scheme. Under the Old-age Scheme the employee and the employer
must each contribute 85% of gross salary. Under the Pre-pension
Scheme the employee and the employer must each contribute 42%
of gross salary. Company contributions to these two plans in
2004 and 2005 were approximately $05million. During 2003,
Detron was under the Zwitserleven labor agreement. This
agreement provides that all employees over the age of
twenty-five and the employer are obliged to contribute to an
Old-age Scheme. Under the Zwitserleven Old-age Scheme, the
employee and the employer must contribute between 38% and 144%
of the base salary, depending upon the employees age.
Company contributions to this plan were $02million for
the year ended December31, 2003. We are self-insured for group health benefits and claims up to
$01million in stop loss coverage.   
11
Incentive Plans At December31, 2003, 2004, and 2005, we had two employee
stock-based incentive plans, an employee stock purchase plan and
an employee stock option plan, which are described below. Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share
for stock options under the fair value method of SFAS123
is described in note2. The per share weighted-average fair
value of stock options granted during 2003, 2004 and 2005 was
$153, $246, and $181 respectively, on the date of grant using
the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following

We established our Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 1997 which
authorizes the issuance of up to 860,000shares of
classA common stock pursuant to the plan. The Employee
Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to elect to have
a portion of their pay deducted by our company in order to
purchase shares of classA common stock. Rights to purchase
shares are deemed granted to participating employees as of the
beginning of each applicable period, as specified by the
Compensation and Stock Option Committee of our board of
directors. The purchase price for each share is not less than
85% of the fair market value of the share of classA common
stock on the first or last trading day of such period, whichever
is lower. In April 2005, the companys Board of Directors
voted to terminate the Employee Stock Purchase Plan effective
December31, 2005. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
we issued 31,779shares in 2003, 28,606shares in
2004, and 42,424shares in 2005. Compensation cost of
approximately $15,000, $21,000, and $23,000, respectively, would
have been recognized under SFASNo123 for the fair
value of the employees purchase rights and is included 64 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The weighted average fair value of the purchase rights granted
in 2003, 2004, and 2005 was $050, $075, and $055 respectively. In connection with our initial public offering, we established
the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan, which currently authorizes
the issuance of up to 8,825,000shares of classA
common stock pursuant to options granted under the plan. Also in connection with our initial public offering, we
established the 1996Directors Stock Option Plan
Directors Plan. The Directors Plan currently
authorizes the issuance of up to 250,000shares of
classA common stock. The Directors Plan provides that
directors are entitled to receive options to purchase shares of
classA common stock in an amount determined at the
discretion of the board of directors. The Directors Plan also
provides for annual grants of options to purchase up to
250,000shares of classB common stock to directors
who are eligible to hold such shares. However, pursuant to the
terms of the Directors Plan, the final annual grant of such
options occurred in 2000. Options granted to directors eligible
to hold classB common stock expire no later than the fifth
anniversary of the date of grant and options granted to
directors who are not eligible to hold classB common stock
expire no later than the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Our directors are also entitled to receive option grants under
the 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan in an amount determined at
the discretion of the board of directors. In 2004, we amended our Employee Stock Option Plan and renamed
it the Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan. Our amended
and restated equity incentive plan provides for the grant of
options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options under Section422 of the Internal Revenue
Code to our employees or employees of any of our subsidiaries,
as well as the grant of cash bonuses, and restricted shares of
classA common stock, stock appreciation rights, restricted
stock, stock units, dividend equivalent rights and
non-qualifying options to employees and any other individuals
whose participation in our amended and restated equity incentive
plan is determined to be in our best interest. Our amended and
restated equity incentive plan authorizes the issuance of up to
8,825,000shares of classA common stock pursuant to
options granted under our amended and restated equity incentive
plan. The option exercise price for incentive stock options
granted under our amended and restated equity incentive plan may
not be less that 100% of the fair market value of our
classA common stock on the date of grant of the option or
110% in the case of an incentive stock option granted to an
optionee beneficially owning more that 10% of the outstanding
classA common stock. The maximum option term is ten years
or five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted
to an optionee beneficially owning more than 10% of the
outstanding classA common stock. Options may be exercised
at any time after grant, except as otherwise provided in the
particular option agreement. There is also a $100,000 limit on
the value of classA common stock determined at the time
of grant covered by incentive stock options that first became
exercisable by an optionee in any year and a 500,000share
limit as to the maximum number of shares of classA common
stock that can be awarded to an individual per calendar year
pursuant to an option. Unless otherwise provided in the option
agreement, options vest in full immediately prior to a change in
control. 65 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

During October 2005, our Chief Executive Officer was granted
a1,000,000 performance based stock options to purchase
shares of the Companys ClassA common stock, and
b500,000 restricted stock units. Half of the performance
based stock options, and all of the restricted stock units, were
granted under the amended and restated equity incentive plan.
The remaining half of the performance based stock options were
granted outside of the amended and restated equity incentive
plan. The performance based options vest in 25% increments based
on our stock price achieving four specified price levels based
on the 20day average closing price per share, provided
that only one third of the total grant will vest during the
year, with the remainder immediately vesting on the January 1 of
the following calendar year. The restricted stock units vest in
one-third increments on each of the first, second and third
anniversary of the date of grant provided our Chief Executive
remains in service with the Company or one of its affiliated
companies. 66 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Lease Commitments We lease office facilities and certain equipment, principally in
the United States, under operating leases expiring on various
dates over the next twelve years. The lease agreements include
renewal options and provisions for rental escalations based on
the Consumer Price Index and require us to pay for executory
costs such as taxes and insurance. The lease agreements also
allow us to elect an early out provision by giving notice and
paying certain lease termination penalties. Benefits associated with a rent abatement period and certain
lease incentives for office facilities are reflected ratably
over the period of the lease. For leases that have been
terminated, the applicable portion of the benefit has been
offset against the lease termination penalty. 67 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Income Loss Per Share Income loss per share is presented on both a basic and diluted
basis in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement
No128, Earnings per Share
SFASNo128. Basic earnings per share
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available
to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
common stock that shared in our earnings. The reconciliations of
the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 are as follows

the computation of diluted earnings. As a result, options to
purchase44million, 37million and
30million shares of ClassA Common Stock outstanding
during the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005,
respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted

Segment Reporting SFASNo131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information established standards for
reporting information about the operating segments in interim
and annual financial reports issued to stockholders. It also
established standards for related disclosures about products and
services and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as
components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the
chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in
deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our
chief operating decision-making group is the Executive
Committee, which comprises the Chief Executive Officer and our
senior vice presidents. Our operating segments are defined geographically by region, the
Americas region and the EMEA region. Both regions provide design
and deployment services, operations and maintenance services and
technical consulting services. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. We evaluate performance based on stand alone operating
segment profit or loss from operations before income taxes not
including nonrecurring gains and losses, and generally accounts
for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or
transfers were to third parties at current market prices.
Interdivisional transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the
location of the assignment. 69 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Related Party Transactions RF Investors, a subsidiary of Telcom Ventures, indirectly owns
the ClassB Common Stock shares outstanding, which have
ten-to-one voting
rights over the ClassA Common Stock shares and therefore
represent approximately 68% voting control. Telcom Ventures,
L.L.C., and its equity holders which include our directors
Dr.Rajendra and Neera Singh are able, without approval of
any other stockholder, to control our operations and maintenance
and the outcome of all matters that our stockholders vote upon,
including the election of directors, amendments to our
certificate of incorporation, and mergers or other business
combinations. Prior to our initial public offering, both our employees and the
employees of Telcom Ventures were eligible to participate in our
life, medical, dental and 401k plans. In connection with the
initial public offering in 1996, we agreed pursuant to an
Overhead and Administrative Services Agreement to allow the
employees of Telcom Ventures to continue to participate in our
employee benefit plans in exchange for full reimbursement of the
cash costs and expenses. We billed Telcom Ventures $71,000 77,000 and $74,000 during 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively,
for payments made by us pursuant to this agreement. We received
reimbursements from Telcom Ventures of $65,000, $82,000 and
$67,000 during 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. At
December31, 2004 and 2005, outstanding amounts associated
with payments made by us under this agreement were $1,000 and
$8,000, respectively, and are included as due from related
parties and affiliates within the consolidated balance sheets in
the accompanying financial statements. During 2005, we provided services to three customers where
Telcom Ventures has a minority investment. Revenues earned from
these customers in the year were $949,000. Billed and unbilled
receivables of $175,000 were outstanding at December31,
2005, and are included in trade accounts receivable and unbilled
receivables in the accompanying consolidated Balance Sheet.
During 2005, we provided services to Telcom Ventures directly,
generating revenues of $14,000 which have been collected. 73 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In December 1999, we issued approximately 108,000shares of
ClassA Common Stock in exchange for a $16million
note receivable from our then President and Chief Executive
Officer. The note was payable on the earlier of December 2004 or
the date he was no longer our President and Chief Executive
Officer. Interest accrued at the federal mid-term rate on the
date of the note and was payable quarterly. The note, where
outstanding, is reflected as a reduction of shareholders
equity in the accompanying statement of shareholders
equity. The note was deemed discharged in 2004. On
December10, 2004, we entered into an agreement with
Mr.Faulders, pursuant to which we purchased certain shares
that Mr.Faulders held in our company and returned these
shares to our treasury account, where they are available for
reissue. Mr.Faulders used the proceeds from his sale of
these shares, approximately $09million, to reduce his
indebtedness under the loan agreement, and we deemed the balance
of the loan, approximately $07million, to have been paid
in full. This represents non-cash compensation to
Mr.Faulders. We also paid Mr.Faulders cash
compensation in the form of a bonus of approximately
$05million to assist him in covering his tax obligations
resulting from this agreement. The total of the non-cash
compensation of $07million and the cash compensation of
$05million is included in operating expenses in 2004. As
part of this agreement, Mr.Faulders surrendered 825,000
vested options to purchase shares of our ClassA common
stock; 500,000, 150,000, 150,000 and 25,000 options at $1356 1225, $500 and $555per share, respectively. In July 2002, we acquired 51% of the outstanding shares of
Detron LCC Network Services B.V., or Detron, a newly formed
corporation in The Netherlands. We acquired the shares from
Westminster, which transferred the shares to Detron Corporation
B.V. in January 2003. Detron had certain ongoing transactions
with Westminster. Under a five-year lease agreement for office
space, Detron recorded rent expense of approximately
$01million, $02million and $01million for
the years ended December31, 2003, 2004 and 2005,
respectively. During 2003, 2004 and 2005 Detron seconded various
idle employees to Detron Telematics B.V., Westminsters
wholly-owned subsidiary and recorded revenue of approximately
$03million, $01million and $01million,
respectively. During the years ended December31, 2003 and
2004, Detron recorded approximately $03million and
$02million, respectively, of management and advisory
fees. In June 2005, LCC United Kingdom Limited, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the company, exercised its option, to purchase
formDetron the remaining 49% interest in the share capital
of Detron.

During the second quarter of 2004, we reversed approximately
$09million of accrued restructuring costs due to
reoccupied office space in McLean, Virginia and a decrease in
the estimated time period expected to sublease space in our
McLean and London offices see note5. During the second quarter of 2004, we took a charge of
approximately $02million for the anticipated dissolution
of our joint venture in China see note6. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we entered into an agreement
with our then President and Chief Executive Officer regarding
his note payable to us under which the note was deemed
discharged. As a result of this transaction we recorded
compensation expense of approximately $12million see
note16. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we reversed approximately
$02million of accrued restructuring costs due to
reoccupied office space in McLean, Virginia see note5. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a charge to our
income tax provision of approximately $41million
primarily attributable to additional valuation allowances and
other adjustments against net operating losses see note9. During the first quarter of 2005, we recorded a cumulative loss
of $142,000 on the Companys deployment contract with a
major customer in the southeastern United States. The
recognition of the cumulative loss was necessary because it was
determined that the fixed-fee contract was in a loss position
due to escalating construction costs. During the second quarter of 2005, a review of the
Companys deployment contract with a major customer in the
north central region of the United States determined that the
margin on the contract was significantly less than previously
expected primarily due to escalating construction costs. As a
result it was necessary to adjust the
inception-to-date gross
profit downward to recognize the effects of the lower margin.
This resulted in a decrease to earnings of $36million in
the second quarter. During the second quarter of 2005, we recorded a net
restructuring charge of $08million. Because the Company
reoccupied some of the leased office space that had previously
been included in the reserve for restructuring, the reserve was
reduced by $02million in the quarter and by
$01million in the fourth quarter see note5. During the third quarter of 2005, we amended two contracts with
a major customer in the north central and southeast regions of
the United States. As a result, it was necessary to adjust the
inception-to-date gross
profit for the two contracts upward to recognize the positive
benefits of the contract amendments. This resulted in an
increase to earnings of $31million in the third quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we had to lower the booking
margins for the two above-mentioned contracts in the north
central and southeast regions of the United States. This caused
earnings to be $06million lower in the fourth quarter
than it would have been if the margin adjustments had not been
made. 75 LCC INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Controls and Procedures aInternal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Managements report on internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and 15d-15f under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the related audit report of
our independent registered public accounting firm are included
under Item8 of this Annual Report on
Form10-K and are
incorporated in this Item9A by reference. bEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our
Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer,
and our Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial
officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of December31, 2005.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that, as of December31,
2005, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. cChanges in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. During the fourth quarter of 2005, management
took the following actions 1.Instituted a requirement that Company personnel
responsible for preparing an estimate of the
percentage-of-completion
of the Companys fixed price contracts for financial
reporting purposes confirm in writing to the Chief Financial
Officer on a quarterly basis that such personnel has confirmed
the accuracy of such estimate with the project managers with
firsthand knowledge of the performance status of the contracts. 2.Reassigned responsibility within the accounting
department for preparation and review of the calculation of the
percentage-of-completion
for large fixed price contracts. The person to whom the
responsibility has now been assigned is more experienced in
accounting for large fixed price contracts. This person will be
supervised by the VP Finance for the Americas who will review
the calculations monthly with the preparer and with the project
manager responsible for the project. 3.Consolidated all contract administration functions under
the Chief Financial Officer. 4.Increased the required scrutiny of revenue and cost
recognition calculations made with respect to all customer
contracts. Quarterly contract reviews of the Americas region
will be attended by the CEO, the CFO and the senior executive
responsible for the Americas. More detailed contract reporting
is being developed which will allow for more detailed review. 5.Realigned the reporting relationships of all regional
financial management such that they now report directly to the
Chief Financial Officer. Although the above actions were implemented, during the
preparation of the fourth quarter and year-end financial
statements for 2005, a member of management did not follow the
prescribed methodology used in the calculations of the
percentage of completion for the Companys largest fixed
price contract, circumventing the Companys established
controls over financial reporting. The methodology utilized in
the calculations for the fourth quarter and year end financial
statements of 2005 was inconsistent with the methodology
utilized in the calculations prepared for the restatements of
2004 and the first quarter of 2005 and the second and third
quarters of 2005. The methodology used in the calculations of
the percentage of completion for this contract have been
corrected in the financial statements contained in this Annual
Report on
Form10-K, but had
they not been corrected, could have resulted in an overstatement
of revenues of $16million and an overstatement of net
income of $01million for the fourth quarter and year end
financial statements of 2005. The action of the member of
management described above constituted a management override of
internal controls. The Company has terminated the employment of
the person who did not follow the prescribed methodology as
described above. There was no indication that fraud was involved. 76 As a result of the foregoing, subsequent to December31,
2005, we are implementing more stringent controls over the
preparation and review of the percentage of completion
calculations for long-term construction contracts in the United
States. These controls include having each project manager
complete and sign a checklist and questionnaire monthly on which
the project manager attests that he or she has reviewed the
calculation and concurs with it. The VP Finance for the Americas
and the project managers will review the calculation with the
CEO and the CFO in the monthly contract reviews. It will be a
requirement that the person serving as VP Finance have a strong
accounting background. Other than the aforementioned changes in the fourth quarter of
2005, there have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during such quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
