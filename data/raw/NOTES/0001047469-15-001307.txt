REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
California Water Service Group
San Jose, California 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of California Water Service Group and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the related
consolidated statements of income, common stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014. We also have audited the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE GROUP      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012      Amounts in thousands,
except share data     1 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS  California Water Service Group Company is a holding company that provides water utility and other related services in California, Washington, New Mexico, and Hawaii through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. California Water Service Company Cal Water, Washington Water Service Company Washington Water, New Mexico Water Service Company New Mexico Water, and Hawaii Water
Service Company,Inc. Hawaii Water provide regulated utility services under the rules and regulations of their respective state regulatory commissions jointly referred to as the
Commissions. CWS Utility Services and HWS Utility ServicesLLC provide non-regulated water utility and utility-related services. 
The
Company operates in one reportable segment, providing water and related utility services. Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America GAAP and include the Company accounts and those of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated from the consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary to provide a fair presentation of the results for the periods covered. 
The
preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the consolidated balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. These
include, but are not limited to, estimates and assumptions used in determining the Company regulatory asset and liability
balances based upon probability assessments of regulatory recovery, utility plant useful lives, revenues earned but not yet billed, asset retirement obligations, allowance for doubtful accounts,
pension and other employee benefit plan liabilities, and income tax-related assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Revenue  Revenue generally includes monthly cycle customer billings for regulated water and wastewater services at rates authorized by
regulatory commissions plus an estimate for water used between the customer last meter reading and the end of the accounting period and billings to certain non-regulated customers at rates
authorized by contract with government agencies. 
The
Company regulated water and related utility services requirements are authorized by the Commissions in the states in which we operate. The revenue requirements are intended to
provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to recover its operating costs and earn a return on investments. 
For
metered customers, Cal Water recognizes revenue from rates which are designed and authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission CPUC. Under the Water Revenue Adjustment
Mechanism WRAM, Cal Water records the adopted level of volumetric revenues, which would include recovery of cost of service and a return on investments, as established by the CPUC for metered
accounts adopted

Amounts in thousands, except share data 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
volumetric
revenues. In addition to volumetric-based revenues, the revenue requirements approved by the CPUC include service charges, flat rate charges, and other items not subject to the WRAM. The
adopted volumetric revenue considers the seasonality of consumption of water based upon historical averages. The variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for
metered accounts is recorded as a component of revenue with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each Cal Water district subject to
certain criteria under the accounting for regulated operations being met. The variance amount may be positive or negative and represents amounts that will be billed or refunded to customers in the
future. 
Cost-recovery
rates are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs allowed to be recovered by the Commissions. Cost-recovery rates such as the Modified Cost Balancing Account
MCBA provides for recovery of adopted expense levels for purchased water, purchased power and pump taxes, as established by the CPUC. In addition, cost-recovery rates include recovery of costs
related to water conservation programs and certain other operating expenses adopted by the CPUC. Variances which include the effects of changes in both rates and volumes for the MCBA between adopted
and actual costs are recorded as a component of revenue, as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to our customers at a later date. Cost-recovery expenses are generally
recognized when expenses are incurred with no markup for return or profit. 
The
balances in the WRAM and MCBA assets and liabilities accounts will fluctuate on a monthly basis depending upon the variance between adopted and actual results. The recovery or refund
of the WRAM is netted against the MCBA over- or under-recovery for the corresponding district. The recovery or refund of net WRAM and MCBA balances are interest bearing at the current 90day
commercial paper rate. At the end of any calendar year, Cal Water files with the CPUC to refund or collect the balance in the accounts. Most undercollected net WRAM and MCBA receivable balances are
collected over 12 or 18months. Cal Water defers net WRAM and MCBA operating revenues and associated costs whenever the net receivable balances are estimated to be collected more than
24months after the respective reporting periods in which it was recognized. The deferred net WRAM and MCBA revenues and associated costs were determined using forecasts of rate payer
consumption trends for future reporting periods and the timing of when the CPUC will authorize Cal Water filings to recover the undercollected balances. Deferred net WRAM and MCBA revenues and
associated costs will be recognized as revenues and costs in future periods when collection is within twenty-four months of the respective reporting period. Flat
rate customers are billed in advance at the beginning of the service period. The revenue is prorated so that the portion of revenue applicable to the current period is included in
that period revenue, with the remaining balance recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheet and recognized as revenue when earned in the subsequent accounting period. The unearned revenue
liability was $1,530 and $1,464 as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This liability is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. The allowance is based upon specific identified accounts plus an
estimate of uncollectible accounts based upon historical percentages.

The
balance of customer receivables is net of the allowance for doubtful accounts at December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 of $697, $668, and $714, respectively. 
The
activities in the allowance for doubtful accounts are as follows:

Ending Balance 697 668 714                
Non-Regulated Revenue  Revenues from non-regulated operations and maintenance agreements are recognized when services have been rendered to companies or
municipalities under such agreements. For construction and design services, revenue is generally recognized on the completed contract method, as most projects are completed in less than three months.
Other non-regulated revenue is recognized when title has transferred to the buyer, or ratably over the term of the lease. Utility Plant  Utility plant is carried at original cost when first constructed or purchased, or at fair value when acquired through acquisition. When
depreciable plant is retired, the cost is eliminated from utility plant accounts and such costs are charged against accumulated depreciation. Maintenance of utility plant is charged to operating
expenses as incurred. Maintenance projects are not accrued for in advance. Interest is capitalized on plant expenditures during the construction period and amounted to $1,535 in 2014, $2,038 in 2013,
and $3,401 in 2012. 
Intangible
assets acquired as part of water systems purchased are recorded at fair value. All other intangibles have been recorded at cost and are amortized over their useful life. The
following table represents depreciable plant and equipment as of December31: 
2014

The
provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate depreciable asset balances was 297% in 2014, 303% in 2013, and 31% 2012. For income tax purposes, as
applicable, the Company computes depreciation using the accelerated methods allowed by the respective taxing authorities. Asset Retirement Obligation  The Company has a legal obligation to retire wells in accordance with State Water Resources Control Board regulations. In addition,
upon decommission of a wastewater plant or lift station certain wastewater infrastructure would need to be retired in accordance with State Water Resources Control Board regulations. An asset
retirement cost and corresponding retirement obligation is recorded when a well or waste water infrastructure is placed into service. As of December31, 2014 and 2013 the retirement obligation
is estimated to be $18,414 and $17,036, respectively. The change only impacted the consolidated balance sheet. Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Cash
and cash equivalents was $196million and $275million as of December31, 2014 and December31, 2013, respectively. Restricted Cash  In 2014 restricted cash includes $05million of proceeds collected through a surcharge on certain customers' bills plus
interest earned on the proceeds and is used to service California Safe Drinking Water Bond obligations. All restricted cash is included in taxes, prepaid expenses, and other assets. As of
December31, 2014 and 2013, restricted cash was $872 and $1,193, respectively.

Short-term
regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from the above table. The short-term regulatory assets for 2014 and 2013 were $53,199 and $30,887, respectively. The short-term
regulatory assets were primarily interim rates and net WRAM/MCBA. The short-term portion of regulatory liabilities for 2014 and 2013 were $6,126 and $1,827, respectively. The short-term regulatory
liabilities were primarily net WRAM/MCBA liability balances and net refund balances to rate payers for conservation program from the 2009 general rate case. The
Company operates extensively in a regulated business, and as such is subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities. Utility companies defer costs and credits on the
balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period in which they
would have been reflected in income by an unregulated company. Regulatory assets other than WRAM represent deferral of costs that will be recovered in the future and do not include a return. In
determining the probability of costs being recognized in other periods, the Company considers regulatory rules and decisions, past practices, and other facts or circumstances that would indicate if
recovery is probable. In the event that a portion of the Company operations were no longer subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities, the Company would be required to write off
related regulatory assets and liabilities. If a commission determined that a portion of the Company assets were not recoverable in customer rates, the Company would be required to determine if a
disallowance of asset costs had occurred. If a disallowance had occurred, it would require a write-down in the assets' valuation.

The
Company qualified, defined-benefit, non-contributory pension plan and other postretirement plan benefit Retire Group Health regulatory asset is the amount the Company expects to
recover from ratepayers in the future for these plans at the end of the calendar year. 
The
property-related tax benefits flowed through to ratepayers relate primarily to the difference between book and federal income tax depreciation on utility plant that was placed in
service before the regulatory Commissions adopted normalization for rate making purposes. Previously, the tax benefit of tax depreciation in excess of book depreciation was passed on to customers
flow-through. For state deferred tax liabilities, the Commission continues to use the flow-through method. As such timing differences reverse, the Company will be able to include the impact of such
differences in customer rates. These federal and state tax flow-through differences will continue to reverse over the remaining book lives of the related assets. 
Other
accrued benefits are accrued benefits for vacation, self-insured workers' compensation, and directors' retirement benefits. The net WRAM and MCBA long-term accounts receivable is
the undercollected portion of recorded revenues that are not expected to be collected from ratepayers within 12months. The asset retirement obligation regulatory asset represents the
difference between costs associated with asset retirement obligations and amounts collected in rates. The health care balancing account regulatory asset is for incurred health care costs that exceeded
the cost recovery in rates and is recoverable from ratepayers as of December31, 2014. 
The
future tax benefits due to ratepayers represent regulatory liabilities for tax deductions that will be taken and flowed through to customers in the future. Regulatory liabilities
also reflect timing differences provided at higher than the current tax rate, which will flow-through to future ratepayers. The conservation program and pension balancing account regulatory
liabilities are for cost recovery in rates that exceeded incurred costs and are refundable to ratepayers as of December31, 2014. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill  The Company regularly reviews its long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually or when events or changes
in business circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully realizable. Potential impairment of assets held for use is determined by comparing the
carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the
amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. 
Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other
identifiable intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is reviewed annually at
November30thfor impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The
impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level using a two- step, fair-value based approach. The first step determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares it
to the reporting unit carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a second step is

performed
to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to the Company tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. This derives
an implied fair value for the reporting unit goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal
to the excess. 
The
recorded goodwill balance as of December31, 2014 and 2013, relate to the Hawaii Water Service Company reporting unit. Based on our annual goodwill impairment test, no
impairment was recorded in 2014 or 2013. Long-Term Debt Premium, Discount and Expense  The discount and issuance expense on long-term debt is amortized over the original lives of the related debt on a straight-line basis
which approximates the effective interest method. Premiums paid on the early redemption of certain debt and the unamortized original issuance discount and expense are amortized over the life of new
debt issued in conjunction with the early redemption. Amortization expense included in interest expense was $797, $1,081, and $1,107 for 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Advances for Construction  Advances for Construction consist of payments received from developers for installation of water production and distribution facilities
to serve new developments. Advances are excluded from rate base for rate setting purposes. Annual refunds are made to developers without interest. Advances of $182,284, and $183,393 at
December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, will be refunded primarily over a 40-year period in equal annual amounts. Estimated refunds of advances for each succeeding year are approximately
$7,587, $7,361, $7,347, $7,330, $7,325 and $145,334 thereafter. Contributions in Aid of Construction  Contributions in Aid of Construction represent payments received from developers, primarily for fire protection purposes, which are not
subject to refunds. Facilities funded by contributions are included in utility plant, but excluded from rate base. Depreciation related to assets acquired from contributions is charged to the
Contributions in Aid of Construction account. Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Measurement of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities is at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Historically
the Commissions reduced revenue requirements for the tax effects of certain originating temporary differences and allowed recovery of these tax costs as the related
temporary differences reverse. The Commissions have granted the Company rate increases to reflect the normalization of the tax benefits

the federal accelerated methods and available Investment Tax Credits ITC for all assets placed in service after 1980. ITCs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related properties for
book purposes. The commissions granted flow-through for state taxes. 
Advances
for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction received from developers subsequent to 1986 were taxable for federal income tax purposes and subsequent to 1991 were
subject to California income tax. In 1996, the federal tax law, and in 1997, the California tax law, changed and only deposits for new services were taxable. In late 2000, federal regulations were
further modified to exclude contributions of fire services from taxable income. The
accounting standards for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes allows the inclusion of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income taxes.
See note10 Income Taxes. Workers' Compensation, General Liability and Other Claims  For workers' compensation, the Company estimates the liability associated with claims submitted and claims not yet submitted based on
historical data. Expenses for workers compensation insurance are included in rates on a pay-as- you-go basis. Therefore, a corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded. For general liability
claims and other claims, the Company estimates the cost incurred but not yet paid using historical information. Collective Bargaining Agreements  As of December31, 2014, the Company had 1,105 employees, including 708 non-supervisory employees who are represented by the
Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, except certain engineering and laboratory employees who are represented by the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO. The
union agreements expire at the end of 2020. Earnings per Share  The computations of basic and diluted earnings per share are noted below. Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts were exercised or converted into common stock. Restricted Stock Awards RSAs are included in the common shares outstanding because the shares have all the same voting and dividend
rights as issued and unrestricted common stock. 
The
Company did not grant any Stock Appreciation Rights SAR in 2014, 2013, and 2012. SARs outstanding were 186,356 shares as of December31, 2014, 283,856 as of
December31, 2013 and 333,856 shares as of December31, 2012.

Stock-based Compensation  The Company follows accounting standards for stock-based compensation. Compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award. The Company recognizes compensation as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. Comprehensive Income or Loss  Comprehensive income for all periods presented was the same as net income. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income  The Company did not have any accumulated other comprehensive income or loss transactions for 2014, 2013, and 2012. Adoption of New Accounting Standards  On May28, 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. This update creates a single, principles based framework for revenue recognition and is based on principles that
govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when goods or services are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
after December15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures.

the years ended December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, amortization of intangible assets was $1,384, $1,354, and $1,298, respectively. Estimated future amortization expense
related to intangible assets for the succeeding five years is approximately $1,478, $1,277, $1,150, $1,026, 725, and $2,325 thereafter. 5 PREFERRED STOCK  The Company is authorized to issue 241,000 shares of Preferred Stock as of December31, 2014. No shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding at December31, 2014
or 2013. 6 COMMON STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  As of December31, 2014 and 2013, 47,806,190 shares and 47,740,957 shares, respectively, of common stock were issued and outstanding. In 2013, the Company sold 5,750,000 shares of
its common stock in an underwritten public offering. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Repurchase Plan  The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan DRIP Plan. Under the DRIP Plan, stockholders may reinvest dividends
to purchase additional Company common stock without commission fees. The Plan also allows existing stockholders and other interested investors to purchase Company common stock through the transfer

The Company transfer agent operates the DRIP Plan and purchases shares on the open market to provide shares for the Plan. 7 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  On June29, 2011, the Company and Cal Water entered into Syndicated Credit Agreements, which provide for unsecured revolving credit facilities of up to an initial aggregate amount
of $400million. The Syndicated Credit Facilities amend, expand, and replace the Company and its subsidiaries' existing credit facilities originally entered into on October27, 2009.
The new credit facilities extended the terms until June29, 2016, increased the Company and Cal Water unsecured revolving lines of credit, and lowered interest rates and fees. The Company
and subsidiaries which it designates may borrow up to $100million under the Company revolving credit facility. Cal Water may borrow up to $300million under its revolving credit
facility; however, all borrowings need to be repaid within twelve months unless otherwise authorized by the CPUC. The proceeds from the revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital
purposes, including the short-term financing of capital projects. The base loan rate may vary from LIBOR plus 725 basis points to LIBOR plus 95 basis points, depending on the Company total
capitalization ratio. Likewise, the unused commitment fee may vary from 8 basis points to 125 basis points based on the same ratio. 
Both
short-term unsecured credit agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for credit facilities of this type including, among other things,
limitations and prohibitions relating to additional indebtedness, liens, mergers, and asset sales. Also, these unsecured credit agreements contain financial covenants governing the Company and its
subsidiaries' consolidated total capitalization ratio and interest coverage ratio.

On
September19, 2013, the U. S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service IRS issued the final and re-proposed tangible property regulations for repairs and
maintenance deductions with an effective date of January1, 2014. These tax regulations allowed the Company to deduct a significant amount of linear asset costs previously capitalized for book
and tax purposes. During 2012, the Company filed an application for a change in tax accounting method with the IRS to implement the repairs and maintenance deduction. The Company 2014, 2013 and 2012
federal qualified repairs and maintenance deductions totaled $452million, $948million, and $1022million and created a $158million and $332million deferred
income tax liability as of December31, 2014 and December31, 2013, respectively.

The
total federal NOL carry-forward was $438million and the state NOL carry-forward was $499million as of December31, 2014 net of any unrecognized tax benefit.
The NOL carry-forward amounts are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore require no valuation allowance. The NOL carry-forward does not begin to expire until 2033. 
In
2013, the Company recorded $40million net of any unrecognized tax benefit of State of California enterprise zone EZ credits for sales and use taxes and hiring incentives
for the period from 2008 to 2013 based on an analysis of all district operations. The Company filed amended state income tax returns for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The 2013 and 2012 State of
California hiring EZ
credits were included on the Company 2012 and 2013 state income tax returns. Unused State of California EZ credits can be carried-forward ten years. The Company estimates the carry-forward portion
of its State of California EZ credits at $23million net of any unrecognized tax benefit. The
American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 provided the Company with additional 50% first-year bonus depreciation for assets placed in service from December31, 2012 to
December31, 2013. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 provided the Company with additional federal income tax deductions for assets placed in
service after September8, 2010 and before December31, 2012. On December19, 2014, President Obama signed into law Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which, among other
provisions, extended the 50-percent special allowance for depreciation bonus depreciation for qualified property through the end of 2014. The federal income tax deduction was estimated at
$204million in 2014, $161million in 2013, and $146million in 2012. As of December31, 2014 and 2013 the deferred tax liability for bonus depreciation was

WRAM/MCBA surcharge, expected to reverse in the following 12months. 
A
valuation allowance was not required at December31, 2014 and 2013. Based on historical taxable income and future taxable income projections over the period in which the
deferred assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the deductible differences.

benefit obligations of the pension plan are $390,593 and $287,894 as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The fair value of pension plan assets was $306,344 and $266,178 as of
December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

to 2010, pension payment obligations were generally funded by the purchase of an annuity from a life insurance company. In 2010, the pension plan trust paid monthly benefits to
retirees, rather than the purchase of an annuity. Payments are expected to be made in each year from 2015 to 2019 are $8,791, $10,030, $11,387, $12,840, and $14,413, respectively. The aggregate
benefits expected to be paid
in the five years 2020 through 2024 are $95,861. The expected benefit payments are based upon the same assumptions used to measure the Company benefit obligation at December31, 2014, and
include estimated future employee service. 
The
Company also maintains an unfunded, non-qualified, supplemental executive retirement plan. The unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan accumulated benefit obligations were
$40,189 and $31,360 as of December31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Benefit payments under the supplemental executive retirement plan are paid currently and are included in the preceding
paragraph. 
The
costs of the pension and retirement plans are charged to expense and utility plant. The Company makes annual contributions to fund the amounts accrued for pension cost.

Amounts in thousands, except share data 11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Continued Other Postretirement Plan  The Company provides substantially all active, permanent employees with medical, dental, and vision benefits through a self-insured
plan. Employees retiring at or after age 58, along with their spouses and dependents, continue participation in the plan by payment of a premium. Plan assets are invested in mutual funds, short-term
money market instruments and commercial paper based upon a similar asset mix to the pension plan. Retired employees are also provided with a five thousand dollar life insurance benefit. 
The
Company records the costs of postretirement benefits other than pension PBOP during the employees' years of active service. Postretirement benefit expense recorded in 2014, 2013,
and 2012, was $8,402, $8,977, and $8,131, respectively. The remaining net periodic benefit cost was $9,790 at December31, 2006, and is being recovered through future customer rates and is
recorded as a regulatory asset. The expected benefit payments, net of retiree premiums and Medicare PartD subsidies, for the years from 2015 to 2019 are $2,197, $2,402, $2,603, $2,903, and
$3,133, respectively. The Medicare PartD subsidies for the years from 2015 to 2019 are $275, $309, $347, $386, and $435. Benefit Plan Assets  The Company actively manages pensions and PBOP trust Plan assets. The Company investment objectives
are Maximize the return on the assets of the Plan, commensurate with the risk that the Company deem appropriate to, meet the obligations
of the Plan, minimize the volatility of the pension expense, and account for contingencies; 
Generate a rate of return for the total portfolio that equals or exceeds the actuarial investment rate assumption; 
Additionally, the rate of return of the total fund shall be measured periodically against a special index comprised of 35% of the
Standard Poor Index, 15% of the Russell 2000 Index, 10% of the MSCI EAFE Index, and 40% of the Lehman Aggregate Bond Index. The special index is consistent with the rate of return objective
and indicates the Company long-term asset allocation objective. The
Company applies a risk management framework for managing the risks associated with employee benefit plan trust assets. The guiding principles of this risk management framework are
the clear articulation of roles and responsibilities, appropriate delegation of authority, and proper accountability and documentation. Trust investment policies and investment manager guidelines
include provisions to ensure prudent diversification, manage risk through appropriate use of physical direct asset holdings and derivative securities, and identify permitted and prohibited
investments.

The
fixed income category includes money market funds, short-term bond funds, and cash. The majority of fixed income investments range in maturities from less than one to five years. 
The
Company target allocation percentages for the PBOP trust is similar to the pension plan except for a larger allocation in fixed income investments and a lower allocation in equity
investments. 
We
use the following criteria to select investment funds Fund past performance; 
Fund meets criteria of Employee Retirements Income Security Act ERISA; 
Timeliness and completeness of fund communications and reporting to investors; 
Stability of fund management company; 
Fund management fees; and 
Administrative costs incurred by the Plan. The
fair value measurements standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities level1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level3 measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
under the standard are described below: Level1Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets that the Plan has the ability to access. 
Level2Inputs to the valuation methodology include:  Quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;  
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;  
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and  
Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 82

The
discount rate was derived from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve using the expected payouts for the plan. The long-term rate of return assumption is the expected rate of return on
a balanced portfolio invested roughly 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income securities. Returns on equity investments were estimated based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings added to a
250% long-term inflation rate. For the pension and other benefit plans, the assumed returns were 826% for domestic equities and 883% for foreign equities. Returns on fixed-income investments were
projected based on investment maturities and credit spreads added to a 250% long-term inflation rate. For the pension and other benefit plans, the assumed returns were 498% for fixed income
investments and 316% for short-term cash investments. The average return for the pension and other benefit plans for the last five and ten years was 970% and 630%, respectively. The company is
using a long-term rate of return of 650% for the pension plan and 550% for the other benefit plan, which is between the 25thand 75thpercentile of expected results. 
In
2014, the Company adopted the Society of Actuaries 2014 Mortality Tables Report RP-2014 and Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2014 with modifications, which updated the mortality
assumptions used for measuring retirement plan obligations. This new mortality table and improvement scale extends the assumed life expectancy of plan participants, resulting in an increase in the
Company accrued benefit cost as of December31, 2014.

The
Company intends to make annual contributions to the plans up to the amount deductible for tax purposes. The Company estimates in 2015 that the annual contribution to the pension
plans will be $33,032 and the annual contribution to the other postretirement plan will be $14,991. 12 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS  The Company has one stockholder-approved stock-based compensation plan. Equity Incentive Plan  The Company equity incentive plan was approved by stockholders on April27, 2005 and May20, 2014. The Company is
authorized to issue awards up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock. During
2014 and 2013, the Company granted annual Restricted Stock Awards RSAs of 60,467 and 74,824 shares, respectively, of common stock to officers and directors of the Company. In
2014 10,544 RSA shares were cancelled and no RSA shares were cancelled in 2013. Employee RSAs granted have a one-year cliff vesting. RSAs granted in 2014 vest over 36months and RSAs granted in
2013 vest over 48months. Director RSAs generally vest at the end of 12months. During 2014 and 2013, the shares granted were valued at $2362 and $2066 per share, respectively, based
upon the fair market value of the Company common stock on the date of grant. 
The
Company granted performance-based Restricted Stock Unit Awards RSUs of 39,232 shares and 50,267 shares of common stock to officers in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Each award
reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient. The awards may be earned upon the completion of a three-year performance period ending on December31, 2015 for the
2013 RSUs and December31, 2016 for the 2014 RSUs. Whether RSUs are earned at the end of the performance period will be determined based on the achievement of certain performance objectives set
by the Board of Director Compensation Committee in connection with the issuance of the RSUs. The performance objectives are based on the Company business plan covering the performance period. The
performance objectives include achieving the budgeted return on equity, budgeted investment in utility plant, customer service standards, employee safety standards and water quality standards.
Depending on the results achieved during the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the performance period may range from 0% to 200%
of the target shares granted,

provided
that the grantee is continuously employed by the Company through the vesting date. If prior to the vesting date employment is terminated by reason of death, disability or normal retirement,
then a pro rata portion of this award will vest. RSUs are not included in diluted shares for financial reporting until earned. The RSUs are recognized as expense ratably over the three year
performance period using a fair market value of $2361 per share for the 2014 RSUs and $2062 per share for the 2013 RSUs and an estimate of RSUs earned during the performance period. 
The
Company has recorded compensation costs for the RSAs and RSUs which are included in administrative and general operating expenses in the amount of $22million and
$18million for 2014 and 2013, respectively. 13 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures provides a single definition of fair value and requires certain disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at
fair value. A hierarchal framework for disclosing the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value is established by this guidance. The three levels in the
hierarchy are as follows: 
Level1Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. The types of
assets and liabilities included in Level1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices. Level2Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices inactive markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, or priced with discounted cash flow or option pricing models using highly observable
inputs. Level3Significant inputs to pricing have little or no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and
liabilities included in Level3 are those valued with models requiring significant management judgment or estimation. 
Specific
valuation methods include the following: 
Accounts
receivable and accounts payable carrying amounts approximated the fair value because of the short-term maturity of the instruments. 
Long-term
debt fair values were estimated using the published quoted market price, if available, or the discounted cash flow analysis, based on the current rates available using a
risk-free rate a U.S. Treasury securities yield curve plus a risk premium of 119%.

Facility leases include office and other facilities in many of its operating districts. The total paid and charged to operations for such leases was $949 in 2014, $1,058 in 2013,
and $1,156 in 2012. The system lease is a 15-year lease with the City of Commerce. The lease includes an annual lease payment of $845 per year plus a cost savings sharing arrangement. 
The
Company has a long-term contract with the Santa Clara Valley Water District that requires the Company to purchase minimum annual water quantities. Purchases are priced at the
districts then-current wholesale water rate. The Company operates to purchase sufficient water to equal or exceed the minimum

quantities
under the contract. The total paid to Santa Clara Valley Water District was $5,486 in 2014, $7,407 in 2013, and $6,164 in 2012. The
Company also has a water supply contract with Stockton East Water District SEWD that requires a fixed, annual payment. Each year, the fixed annual payment is adjusted for changes
to SEWD costs. Because of the fixed annual price arrangement, the Company operates to receive as much water as possible from SEWD in order to minimize the cost of operating Company-owned wells used
to supplement SEWD deliveries. The total paid under the contract was $8,739 in 2014, $9,990 in 2013, and $6,591 in 2012. 
Estimated
annual contractual obligations in the table above are based on the same payment levels as 2014. Future increased costs by SEWD are expected to be offset by a decline in the
allocation of costs to the Company, as other customers of SEWD are expected to receive a larger allocation based upon growth of their service areas. 
On
September21, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Kern County Water Agency Agency to obtain treated water for the Company operations. The term of the agreement
is to January1, 2035, or until the repayment of the Agency bonds described hereafter occurs. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is obligated to purchase approximately 19,000
acre feet of treated water in 2014 and an incrementally higher volume of water for each subsequent year until 2017, when the Company is obligated to purchase 20,500 acre feet of treated water per
year. The Company is obligated to pay the Capital Facilities Charge and the Treated Water Charge regardless of whether it can use the water in its operation, and is obligated for these charges even if
the Agency cannot
produce an adequate amount to supply the 20,500 acre feet in the year. This agreement supersedes a prior agreement with Kern County Water Agency for the supply of 11,500 acre feet of water per year.
Total annual expense in 2014 was $6,704, $6,289 in 2013, and $6,272 in 2012. 
Three
other parties, including the City of Bakersfield, are also obligated to purchase a total of 32,500 acre feet per year under separate agreements with the Agency. Further, the Agency
has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate supplies. The participation of all parties in the transaction for expansion of
the Agency facilities, including the Water Purification Plant, purchase of the water, and payment of interest and principal on the bonds being issued by the Agency to finance the transaction is
required as a condition to the obligation of the Agency to proceed with expansion of the Agency facilities. If any of the other parties does not use its allocation, that party is obligated to pay
its contracted amount. 
The
Agency has issued bonds to fund the project and uses the payments of the Capital Facilities Charges by the Company and the other contracted parties to meet the Agency obligations
to pay interest and repay principal on the bonds. If any of the parties were to default on making payments of the Capital Facilities Charge, then the other parties are obligated to pay for the
defaulting party share on a pro-rata basis. If there is a payment default by a party and the remaining parties have to make payments, they are also entitled to a pro-rata share of the defaulting
party water allocation. 
The
Company expects to use all its entitled water in its operations every year. In addition, if the Company were to pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default of
another participating party; the Company believes it could use this additional water in its operations without incurring

substantial
incremental cost increases. If additional treated water is available, all parties have an option to purchase this additional treated water, subject to the Agency right to allocate the
water among the parties. 
The
total obligation of all parties, excluding the Company, is approximately $82,397 to the Agency. Based on the credit worthiness of the other participants, which are government
entities, it is believed to be highly unlikely that the Company would be required to assume any other parties' obligations under the contract due to their default. In the event of default by a party,
the Company would receive entitlement to the additional water for assuming any obligation. 
We
pay a capital facilities charge and charges related to treated water that together total $7,744 annually, which equates to $378 dollars per acre foot. Total treated water charge for
2014 was $2,760. As treated water is being delivered, we will also be obligated for our portion of the operating costs; that portion is currently estimated to be $14 dollars per acre foot. The actual
amount will vary due to variations from estimates, inflation, and other changes in the cost structure. Our overall estimated cost of $378 dollars per acre foot is less than the estimated cost of
procuring untreated water assuming water rights could be obtained and then providing treatment. 
There
are three capital leases; the most significant was the City of Hawthorne water system. In 2011, we entered into a 15-year capital lease agreement to operate the City of Hawthorne
water system. The system, which is located near the Hermosa Redondo district, serves about half of Hawthorne population. The agreement required us to make an up-front $8,100 lease deposit to the
city that is being amortized over the lease term. Additionally, annual lease payments of $940 are made to the city and shall be increased or decreased each year on July1, by the same
percentage that the rates charged to customers served by the water system increased or decreased, exclusive of pass-through increases or decreases in the cost of water, power, and city-imposed fees,
compared to the rates in effect on July1 of the prior year, provided, that in no event will the annual lease payment be less than $940. Under the lease we are responsible for all aspects of
system operation and capital improvements, although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city. In exchange, we receive all revenue from the water system, which was $7,802 7,688, and $7,621 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. At the end of the lease, the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the
lease. The annual payments were $940 in 2014, 2013, and 2012. The capital lease asset was $8,736 as of December31, 2014. Contingencies  Groundwater Contamination  The Company has undertaken litigation against third parties to recover past and future costs related to ground water contamination in
our service areas. The cost of litigation is expensed as incurred and any settlement is first offset against such costs. The Commission general policy requires all proceeds from contamination
litigation to be used first to pay transactional expenses, then to make ratepayers whole for water treatment costs to comply with the Commission water quality standards. The Commission allows for a
risk-based consideration of contamination proceeds which exceed the costs of the remediation described above and may result in some sharing of proceeds with the shareholder, determined on a case by

case
basis. The Commission has authorized various memorandum accounts that allow the Company to track significant litigation costs to request recovery of these costs in future filings and uses of
proceeds to comply with Commission general policy. Other Legal Matters  From time to time, the Company is involved in various disputes and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The status of each significant matter is reviewed and assessed for potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount of the
range of loss can be estimated, a liability is accrued for the estimated loss in accordance with the accounting standards for contingencies. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the
outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. While the outcome of these disputes and litigation matters cannot be
predicted with any certainty, management does not believe when taking into account existing reserves the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the Company financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows. The Company has recognized a liability of $32million for all known legal matters as of December31, 2014 mostly due to main and service leaks. The
reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued was $15million. The cost of litigation is expensed as incurred and any settlement is first offset against such costs. Any
settlement in excess of the cost to litigate is accounted for on a case by case basis, dependant on the nature of the settlement. 15 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED  The Company common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CWT.

Management Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, recognized that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Accordingly, our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
December31, 2014. Based on that evaluation, we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2014, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On May14, 2013, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO issued
an updated version of its Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013 Framework. Originally issued in 1992 1992 Framework, the framework helps organizations design, implement and
evaluate the effectiveness of internal control concepts and simplify their use and application. During 2014, management implemented the 2013 Framework to assess the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the COSO. Management has concluded that, as of December31,
2014, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte ToucheLLP, has audited the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
