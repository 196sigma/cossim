STATEMENTS
50 44 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON
THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Indus International, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Indus International, Inc. the Company as of
March31, 2004 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash
flows for the year ended December31, 2002, for the three
months ended March31, 2003, and for each of the two years
in the period ended March31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company at March31,
2004 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year ended December31, 2002,
for the three months ended March31, 2003, and for each of
the two years in the period ended March31, 2005, in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles. As discussed in Note2, the Companys consolidated
financial statements have been restated. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated June10, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion on managements assessment and an
adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting.

Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies   
Organization and Business   
Business Indus International, Inc. the Company develops,
licenses, implements, supports and hosts service delivery
management SDM solutions, which help clients in a
broad array of industries optimize the management of their
customers, assets, workforce, spare parts inventory, tools and
documentation in order to maximize performance and customer
satisfaction while reducing operating expenses. The
Companys software products are comprised of three distinct
suites: Customer Suite, Asset Suite and Service Suite. Customer
Suite, originating from the March 2003 acquisition of Indus
Utility Systems, Inc. IUS, formerly SCT Utility
Systems, Inc., provides the functionality for energy and utility
customers to optimize customer-facing activities, encompassing
call center, customer information tracking, billing and accounts
receivable functions. Asset Suite supports organizations
operations and maintenance workforce, inventory management and
procurement professionals, safety and compliance engineers, and
other decision-making personnel affected by asset care decisions
throughout the enterprise. Service Suite, originating from the
January 2004 acquisition of Wishbone Systems, Inc.
Wishbone provides resource optimization enabling
customers to dispatch resources with all the required tools,
information, and parts at the promised time, optimizing
schedules based on customer or asset demands, travel times,
service level agreements, technician skills requirements and
internal costs. Other complementary products include mobile
computing, enterprise asset integration tools, sophisticated
search capabilities, data warehousing products and integration
to leading ERP products for financial and human resources
functions. Through its acquisitions, the Company is able to
offer a comprehensive suite of SDM solutions to its customers. The Companys SDM solutions also include consulting,
training and educational services, and customer support, hosting
and outsourcing services, offered as part of the Indus Service
Select program. Service Select offerings include comprehensive
implementation programs, strategic consulting, training and
education solutions and three-tiered customer maintenance and
support plans.   
Significant Customers In 2001, Magnox Electric plc Magnox, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd
BNFL, operating BNFLs nuclear power
stations, selected the Company to provide work management and
compliance system software for eight nuclear stations. The
Company is providing a total business solution, including Asset
Suite, implementation services, and five years of application
hosting via Indus web hosting services. The Magnox
contract represented 126%, 112%, 84% and 49% of the
Companys revenue for the year ended December31,
2002, the three-month period ended March31, 2003 and the
years ended March31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. No other
single customer accounted for more than 10% of the
Companys revenues for the periods presented.   
Significant Accounting Policies   
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation. The Company has restated the consolidated balance sheet as of
March31, 2004, and the consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the
year ended December31, 2002, the three-month transition
period ended March31, 2003 and the year ended
March31, 2004 in this Annual Report on Form10-K and
quarterly results of operations for the years ended
March31, 2004 and 2005. See Note2 to the 50 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Consolidated Financial Statements, Restatement of
Financial Statements for Accounting for Leases and Leasehold
Improvements and Note16, Quarterly
Results, for further discussion.   
Revenue Recognition The Company provides its software to customers under contracts
that provide for both software license fees and services. The
revenues from software license fees are recognized in accordance
with AICPA Statements of Position, or SOP, 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, as amended or interpreted by
SOP98-4 and SOP98-9, Technical Practice Aids, and
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. Revenue for software is
recognized when persuasive evidence of a non-cancelable license
agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the license fee is
fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Revenue from
services, which generally are time and material based, are
recognized as the work is performed. When software is licensed
through indirect sales channels, license fees may be recognized
as revenue upon licensing to the reseller or when the reseller
licenses the software to an end user customer, depending upon
the Companys history with the reseller, the
resellers financial resources and other factors. In
software arrangements that include rights to multiple software
products and/or services, the total arrangement fee is allocated
among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under
which revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on
vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair
value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of
revenue are allocated to the delivered elements. Elements
included in multiple element arrangements may consist of
software products, maintenance which includes customer support
services and unspecified upgrades, hosting and consulting
services. VSOE is based on the price generally charged when an
element is sold separately or, in the case of an element not yet
sold separately, the price established by authorized management,
if it is probable that the price, once established, will not
change once the element is sold separately. If VSOE does not
exist for an undelivered element, the total arrangement fee will
be taken to revenue over the life of the contract or upon
delivery of the undelivered element. Revenue is recognized using contract accounting for arrangements
involving significant customization or modification of the
software or where software services are considered essential to
the functionality of the software. Revenue from these software
arrangements is recognized using the percentage-of-completion
method with progress to completion measured using specific
milestones, usually labor cost inputs, with revisions to
estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known.
Project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period
in which they become known. Revenue from maintenance and support services is recognized
ratably over the term of the support contract, typically one
year. Revenue from outsourcing and web hosting also referred to as
ASP or application service provider services is
recognized based upon contractually agreed upon rates per user
or service, over a contractually defined time period. Under some
web hosting arrangements, customers have a license to the
software and are entitled to take possession of the software at
any time during the hosting period, while other customers are
only entitled to use the software through the hosting
arrangement. For arrangements in which the customer has the
contractual right to take possession of the software at any time
during the hosting period without significant penalty, the
Company recognizes revenue under the accounting policies
disclosed above in the revenue recognition accounting policy for
software arrangements. For arrangements where the customer does
not have the right to take possession of the software, the
Company recognizes license revenue over the course of the
hosting contract period. Unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts related to
revenue under existing contracts that has been recorded either
as deferred revenue or earned revenue but which has not yet been
billed. Generally, unbilled amounts are billed within one year
of the sale of product or performance of services. 51 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Deferred revenue represents fees for services and software
licenses that have not yet met the criteria to be recognized as
revenue. Deferred support represents amounts invoiced prior to
performance of support services. Contracts for support services
are typically one year in length and are amortized to revenue
ratably over the contract period. Deferred services are amounts
invoiced prior to performance of consulting services. Deferred license revenue represents license fee contracts
revenue which was deferred because the criteria for revenue
recognition had not been met. Revenue on these contracts is
recognized when these criteria are met and have occurred.   
Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. The
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been
translated into U.S.Dollars. Asset and liability accounts
have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date. The foreign statements of operations have
been translated using average exchange rates. Gains and losses
resulting from translation of the accounts of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries have been reported in other comprehensive
income loss within stockholders equity. Gains and losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the
determination of net income loss.   
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments where the Company may be subject to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company has
investment policies and procedures that are reviewed
periodically to minimize credit risk. The Companys
customers are generally large companies in the utilities, oil
and gas, defense, pulp and paper and metals and mining
industries. The Company routinely assesses the financial
strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that
its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated accounts receivable losses resulting from the
inability or failure of its customers to make required payments.
This allowance is formula-based, supplemented by an evaluation
of specific accounts where there may be collectibility risk. On
an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the collectibility of
accounts receivable based upon historical collections and an
assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts using a
combination of factors, including the age of the outstanding
balances, evaluation of the accounts financial
condition, recent payment history, and discussions with the
Companys account executive for the specific customer.
Based upon this evaluation of collectibility, any increase or
decrease required in the allowance for doubtful accounts is
reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a
change is necessary. The following is an analysis of the activity in the allowance
for doubtful accounts in thousands

IUS acquisition, both of which had been reserved previously. One customer Magnox represented $19million of the
Companys accounts receivable as of March31, 2004.
One customer Sierra Pacific Resources represented
$42million of the Companys accounts receivable as
of March31, 2005.   
Restricted Cash At March31, 2005, the Company maintained cash deposits
totaling approximately $60million in support of seven
standby letters of credit, collateral for a mortgage and a bank
guarantee. These deposits are classified as restricted cash, of
which $194,000 is included in current assets and the balance of
$58million in non-current assets. The letters of credit
require the Company to maintain corresponding compensating
balances equal to the amounts of the letters of credit. A total
of $46million in restricted cash will be released in
increments of $23million each in both July 2006 and May
2008, relative to the expiration of letters of credit supporting
a performance bond and the Companys leased facilities in
SanFrancisco, CA, respectively. A $06million
certificate of deposit, used as collateral for the
Companys $115million mortgage note payable on its
Columbia, SC property, will be released in April 2008.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment under
capital leases is stated at the lower of fair market value or
the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease. Depreciation on office and computer equipment and furniture is
computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of four to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
related lease term or their estimated useful lives. Software
purchased for internal use is amortized using the straight-line
method over estimated useful lives of four to five years.   
Software Development Costs The Company accounts for software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed, whereby costs for the development of new
software products and substantial enhancements to existing
software products are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility has been established, at which time any additional
costs are capitalized. Technological feasibility is established
upon completion of a working model. Through December31,
2002, software development costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility were not significant,
and all software development costs were charged to research and
development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations during that time. The Company capitalized certain internal and external
development costs related to the internationalization of its
products to Asian markets of $04million and
$73million for the three-month period ended
March31, 2003 and for the year ended March31, 2004,
respectively. The product became generally available for sale in
the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and the related capitalized
software development costs became subject to amortization. These
costs are amortized to cost of software license fees based on
the greater of the amount computed using athe ratio that
current gross revenues for the product bear to the total of
current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product
or bthe straight-line method over the remaining economic
life of the product including the period reported on.
Amortization expense recorded for the year ended March31,
2005 was $27million. 53 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Internal-Use Software SOP98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, requires
that entities capitalize certain costs related to internal use
software once certain criteria have been met. Capitalized
internal-use software development costs associated with the
Companys information systems are included in property and
equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over a
three-year period. The depreciation expense recorded for the
year ended December31, 2002, the three-month period ended
March31, 2003 and the years ended March31, 2004 and
2005 was approximately $24million, $643,000 28million and $22million, respectively.   
Acquisition-Related Intangible assets Acquisition-related intangible assets are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization, and include values for developed
technology, customer base, contracts and trade names. Acquired
technology is being amortized over the greater of the amount
computed using athe ratio that current gross revenues
for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated
future gross revenues for that product or bthe
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life
of the product including the period being reported on. Other
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over a period of two to fifteen years. Total amortization
expense for intangible assets was $152,000, $18million
and $20million for the three-month period ended
March31, 2003 and the years ended March31, 2004 and
2005, respectively, and is included in general and
administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Acquisition-related intangible assets consist of the following

54 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In accordance with SFASNo144, intangible assets are
reviewed to determine whether they should be tested for
impairment. At March31, 2005, the Company performed this
review and determined no impairment testing was necessary.   
Goodwill and Impairment Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over
fair value of net assets acquired, increased by $486,000 during
the year ended March31, 2005. The Company recorded an
adjustment to the purchase price of Wishbone resulting in an
increase in goodwill for the costs to relocate certain Wishbone
employees to Atlanta, GA, as planned with the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
testing on December31, and between annual evaluations if
events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying
amount. For purposes of its goodwill impairment testing, the
Company considers itself to be a single reporting unit and
assesses goodwill impairment on an enterprise-wide level. The
impairment test is performed on a consolidated basis and
compares the Companys market capitalization reporting
unit fair value to its outstanding equity reporting unit
carrying value. In accordance with the recommended provisions
of SFASNo142, the Company utilizes its closing
stock price as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the
date of the impairment test in order to compute market
capitalization. The Company has designated December31 as
the annual date for impairment testing. The Company has recorded goodwill of $04million
associated with the acquisition of IUS and $70million
associated with the acquisition of Wishbone. No impairment
losses have been recorded through March31, 2005.   
NotesPayable Notes payable represents short-term borrowings. The Company
includes in notes payable only those principal balances which
are to be paid within the subsequent twelve-month period. The
notes payable balance at March31, 2005 includes the
current portion of an $115million note secured by certain
real property located in Columbia, SC. This note bears interest
at an annual rate of 65% and is payable in monthly installments
of principal and interest determined on a 15-year amortization
through October1, 2008, at which time the remaining
principal balance of $77million is due and payable. The
Company may extend the maturity date at that time for one
additional five year term at a variable rate of interest.   
Guarantees and Indemnifications The Company accounts for guarantees and indemnifications in
accordance with Financial Interpretation No45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others. License and hosting agreements with customers generally contain
infringement indemnity provisions. Under these agreements, the
Company generally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the customer in connection with patent, copyright, trademark or
trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with
respect to the customers authorized use of our products
and services. The indemnity provisions generally provide for the
Company to control defense and settlement and cover costs and
damages finally awarded against the customer. The indemnity
provisions also generally provide that if the Company products
infringe, or in the Companys opinion it is likely that
they will be found to infringe, on the rights of a third-party
Indus will, at its option and expense, procure the right to use
the infringing product, modify the product so it is no longer
infringing, or return the product for a partial refund that
reflects the reasonable value of prior use. The Company has not
previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under
these indemnification obligations. The Company accounts for
these indemnity obligations in accordance with
SFASNo5 55 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Accounting for Contingencies, and records a
liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and
reasonably estimable. The Company has not recorded any
liabilities for these arrangements as of March31, 2005. Services agreements with customers may also contain indemnity
provisions for death, personal injury or property damage caused
by the Companys personnel or contractors in the course of
performing services to customers. Under these agreements, the
Company generally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the customer in connection with death, personal injury and
property damage claims made by third parties with respect to
actions of the Companys personnel or contractors. The
indemnity provisions generally provide for the Companys
control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages
finally awarded against the customer. The indemnity obligations
contained in services agreements generally have no specified
expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the
amount of award covered. The Company has not previously incurred
costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification
obligations and estimates the fair value of these potential
obligations to be nominal. Accordingly, no liabilities have been
recorded for these agreements as of March31, 2005. Some service agreements require the Company to maintain
performance bonds as security for the performance of the
Companys obligations under those agreements. Some of the
performance bonds require cash to be restricted as collateral.
The obligations to maintain these bonds typically expire either
at a date specified in the applicable contract or upon the
performance of the Companys obligations. Due to the
Companys historical experience of successful software
implementations, the Company has no significant history of
payment under these types of bonds. The Company has not recorded
any liabilities for these arrangements as of March31, 2005. The Company generally warrants that its software products will
perform in all material respects in accordance with its standard
published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of
the licensed products to the customer for six months to a year,
depending upon the software license. Additionally, contracts
generally warrant that services will be performed consistent
with generally accepted industry standards or, in some
instances, specific service levels through completion of the
agreed upon services. If necessary, provision will be made for
the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on
specific warranty claims and claim history. There has been no
significant recurring expense under these product or service
warranties.   
Advertising Costs Advertising costs are charged to expense in the period the costs
are incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $846,000 47,000, $187,000 and $92,000 for year ended December31,
2002, the three-month period ended March31, 2003 and the
years ended March31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, and are
included in Sales and Marketing in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations.   
Segment Information The Company operates in a single segment as defined by
SFASNo131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. See Note12 for
discussion of foreign operations.   
Income Taxes Income taxes are computed in accordance with
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires the use of the liability method in accounting for
income taxes. Under SFASNo109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured based on differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. 56 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

those securities.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Those
accounts that are affected by the use of estimates are revenues
from services the determination of the scope and duration of
the engagement and the status of completion to date, the
allowance for doubtful accounts the valuation of the credit
worthiness of our customers, and accrued restructuring costs
the estimate of future sublease income for excess office space. 57 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, the
Company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with

Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Statement123R supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends
FASB Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, the approach in Statement123R is similar to
the approach described in Statement123. However,
Statement123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Statement123R must be adopted no later than the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June15,
2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which
financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company
expects to adopt Statement123R during its first quarter
in fiscal 2007. Statement123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods: 1a modified
prospective method in which compensation cost is
recognized beginning with the effective date abased on
the requirements of Statement123R for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and bbased on
the requirements of Statement123 for all awards granted to
employees prior to the effective date of
Statement123Rthat remain unvested on the effective date;
and 2a modified retrospective method which
includes the requirements of the modified prospective method
described above, but also permits entities to restate based on
the amounts previously recognized under Statement123 for
purposes of pro forma disclosures either aall prior
periods presented or bprior periods of the year of
adoption. The Company has not yet determined which method it
will adopt. As permitted by Statement123, the Company currently
accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion
No25s intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no compensation expense cost for employee
stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of
Statement123Rs fair value method will have a
significant impact on the Companys results of operations,
although it will have no impact on the Companys overall
financial position. The impact of adoption of
Statement123R cannot be predicted at this time because
it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future. However, had the Company adopted Statement123R
in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have
approximated the impact of Statement123 as described in
the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in
Note1 Stock-Based Compensation to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Statement123R also
requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current
literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash
flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after
adoption. However, in the case of the Company, the existence of
its net operating loss carryforward will preclude recognition of
the tax benefit until the deduction can be used to offset
current taxes payable. The Company cannot estimate what the tax
amounts will be in the future or when they will be recognized,
because they depend on, among other things, when the net
operating loss carryforwards will expire and when employees
exercise stock options.   
2.
Restatement of Financial Statements for Accounting for Leases
and Leasehold Improvements On February7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of
the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants regarding certain operating lease-related accounting
issues and their application under U.S.generally accepted
accounting principles. In consideration of this letter, the
Company conducted a review of its accounting for leases and
leasehold improvements and identified errors in prior reported
periods related to its 1accounting for scheduled rent
escalations, 2accounting for lease incentives in the
form of tenant improvement reimbursements and
3amortization of leasehold improvements. Items1
and 2, which account for the majority of the errors, relate to
operating leases for office facilities entered into by the
Company in 2000. 59 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company has restated previously issued financial statements
for the fiscal years ended December31, 2000 through
March31, 2004 to correct the Companys historical
accounting practices for leases and leasehold improvements. As a
result, the Company has restated the consolidated balance sheet
as of March31, 2004, and the consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for the
year ended December31, 2002, the three-month transition
period ended March31, 2003 and the year ended
March31, 2004 in this Annual Report on Form10-K and
quarterly results of operations for the years ended
March31, 2004 and 2005 see Note16 entitled
Quarterly Results of Operations. The impact of the
restatement on periods prior to the fiscal year ended
December31, 2002 has been reflected as an adjustment to
accumulated deficit as of December31, 2001 in the
accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders
equity. The restatement corrects the Companys historical
accounting for leases and leasehold improvements and has no
impact on revenues or net cash flows. The Company will not amend
and reissue its previously filed Annual Reports on
Form10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q for the
restatements. Therefore, the financial statements and related
financial information contained in those reports should no
longer be relied upon. Historically, rent expense has been recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations at the amount of the lease payments.
Management has determined that minimum lease payments, including
scheduled rent escalations, should be recognized as rent expense
on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has
historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as
reductions to the related capitalized leasehold improvements on
the consolidated balance sheets and as reductions in capital
expenditures included in investing activities on the
consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company reviewed
lease incentives received in the form of tenant improvement
reimbursements and has adjusted leasehold improvements to
properly account for these lease incentives, which has the
general effect of increasing leasehold improvement amortization
expense and decreasing rent expense. The Company has also
reviewed its accounting for leasehold improvements to ensure
amortization over the shorter of their economic lives or the
remaining lease term. This review resulted in an extension of
the amortization periods for leasehold improvements, which had
the effect of decreasing annual leasehold amortization expense. The restatement resulted in a $13million increase in the
cumulative net losses for all reported periods ending
March31, 2004. 60 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Restructuring Expenses In the year ended March31, 2005, the Company recorded net
restructuring charges of $104million for revisions to
accounting estimates from prior business restructurings and for
additional restructuring charges related to office and business
consolidations and employee severance. Revisions to the
Companys assumptions for expected sublease income from two
unoccupied floors in San Francisco, CA comprised
$04million of this expense. Further consolidation of
office space in San Francisco and Atlanta, GA resulted in
$70million in new restructuring charges for the year.
This consolidation included vacating three floors in Atlanta and
one additional floor in SanFrancisco. The remaining
$30million in restructuring expense is associated with
the elimination of approximately 140 positions, including the
transfer of certain functions to the company-owned office
buildings in Columbia, SC and the outsourcing of some
development functions to India. At March31, 2005, a total
of $59million remains in the current and long-term
restructuring accruals for these initiatives and relates to
employee severance and excess lease costs associated with
subleasing the Companys vacated office space in Atlanta
and San Francisco. These restructuring charges have been
recorded in accordance with SFASNo146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities and SFASNo112,
Employers Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits. Between January1, 2000 and March31, 2004, the
Company recorded restructuring charges totaling
$218million relating to two restructuring initiatives:
1the relocation of the Companys headquarters from
San Francisco to Atlanta; and 2the suspension of the
United Kingdom Ministry of Defense MoD project. At
March31, 2005, a total of $70million remains in the
current and long-term restructuring accruals for these
initiatives, all of which relates to excess lease costs
associated with subleasing the Companys vacated office
space in San Francisco, Dallas, TX and Pittsburgh, PA. Should rental conditions in the Companys Atlanta location
deteriorate to the point where the remaining redundant office
space is not leased, the Company could incur additional charges
totaling approximately $66million through 2012. Should
rental conditions improve, it is possible that higher than
anticipated sublease income could be generated. Any increases or
decreases in the restructuring accruals arising from changes in
estimates will be reflected in the period in which the
evaluation indicates that a change is necessary. 62 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The restructuring accruals remaining as of March31, 2005
are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Accrued liabilities for amounts due within one year

Stockholders Equity The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations
prescribed by Delaware law, to provide for the issuance of
shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish
from time to time the number of shares to be included in each
such series, to fix the powers, preferences and rights of the
shares of each wholly un-issued series and any qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereon, and to increase or decrease
the number of shares of any such series but not below the
number of shares of such series then outstanding, without any
further vote or action by the stockholders. The Board of
Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with
voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the
voting power of other rights of the holders of common stock.
Thus, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the
Company. The Company has no current plan to issue any shares of
preferred stock. On January25, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
Stockholder Protection Rights Plan Rights Plan.
Under the Rights Plan, a dividend of one right
Right for each outstanding share of common stock
was distributed to stockholders of record at the close of
business on February4, 2005. The Rights will be
exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the Companys common stock or
commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire 20% or more of
the Companys common stock. If either event occurs, each
Right would entitle its holder other than the person or group
that exceeded the threshold to purchase, at the exercise price
of $1700, a number of shares of Indus common stock having a
market value equal to twice such exercise price. Also, if Indus
were to be acquired in a merger or other business combination
initiated by a person or group that had acquired 20% or more of
the Companys outstanding stock, each Right would entitle
its holder other than the person or group that exceeded the
threshold to purchase, at such exercise price, a number of
common shares in the acquiring company having a market value
equal to twice such exercise price. Upon being distributed, the
Rights will automatically attach to and trade with all shares of
Indus common stock. The Rights will not trade separately from
the common stock unless and until they become exercisable. The
Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights at any
time prior to the time at which the rights became exercisable.
Unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Board of Directors,
the Rights will expire on January25, 2015. In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors approved a
stock repurchase program for up to 2,000,000shares of the
Companys outstanding common stock. The Company is
authorized to use available cash to buy back its shares in open
market transactions from time to time, subject to price and
market 66 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued conditions. As of March31, 2005, the Company held, as
treasury stock, 435,500shares that had been repurchased at
a cost of approximately $22million under the program. In April 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Robert
Felton, a founder of the Company and former Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Under this
agreement, the Company repurchased 500,000shares of the
Companys common stock from Mr.Felton at a price of
$500per share, which approximated market value at the
time of the agreement, for an aggregate purchase price of
$25million. As part of this agreement, Mr.Felton
agreed not to transfer or enter into any agreement to transfer
the remainder of his shares of the Companys stock for a
period of one year. These repurchased shares are also held as
treasury stock. On March5, 2003, the Company completed a private placement
offering to purchasers of approximately 68million shares
of the Companys common stock, par value $0001per
share, at a purchase price of $150per share, or a total
of approximately $102million, and approximately
$145million of the Companys 8%Convertible
Notes in order to fund the IUS acquisition. The convertible
notes were converted into 9,751,859shares of common stock
on July29, 2003. Related parties, consisting of the
Companys then Chairman and CEO and certain principal
stockholders, purchased 11% and 38% of the common stock and
convertible notes, respectively. The Company believes that these
transactions were carried out at an arms-length basis,
given the fact that a majority of the purchasers of these
securities were unrelated third parties. On February9, 2004, the Company completed a private
placement offering of 50million shares of the
Companys common stock, at a price per share of $310, or a
total of approximately $155million. Net proceeds from
this offering were used to replenish cash used in the
acquisition of Wishbone as well as for general working capital
purposes.

The amount of options vested and exercisable for the year ended
December31, 2002, the three-month period ended
March31, 2003 and the year ended March31, 2004, were
4,580,167, 4,920,064 and 4,080,382, respectively.   
Employee Stock Purchase Plans The 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan reserved
1,000,000shares of common stock for issuance. The plan
allowed for eligible employees to purchase stock at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the Companys common
stock as of the first day of each six-month offering period or
the fair market value of the stock at the end of the offering
period. Purchases were limited to 10% of each employees
compensation and a maximum of 4,000shares. Under the plan,
the Company issued 167,606shares in the year of 2002, at
prices ranging from $150 to $333per share. Effective
November1, 2002, the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was
concluded as all the authorized shares under the plan had been
distributed. The Company obtained stockholder approval for a new
employee stock purchase plan at its 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders. The 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan reserved
2,500,000shares of common stock for issuance. The plan
allows for eligible employees to purchase stock at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the Companys common
stock as of the first day of each six-month offering period or
the fair market value of the stock at the end of the offering
period. Purchases are limited to 10% of each employees
compensation and a maximum of 4,000shares. Under the plan,
the Company issued 72,109 and 252,740shares in the years
ended March31, 2004 and 2005, respectively, at prices
ranging from $178 to $206per share.   
10.
Alternative Method of Valuing Stock Options For employee stock options granted with exercise prices at or
above the existing market, the Company records no compensation
expense. Compensation costs for stock options granted to
employees is measured by the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of the Companys stock at the date of grant
over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required by SFASNo123, as amended by
SFASNo148, and described and disclosed in
Note1, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value
method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model 70 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued with the following weighted-average assumptions for the year
ended December31 2002, the three- month period ended
March31, 2003 and the years ended March31, 2004 and
2005, respectively: risk free interest rate of 425%, 299 309% and 369%; dividend yields of 0%; volatility of 128 107%, 99% and 85%; and a weighted-average expected life of the
option of six years.   
11.
Employee Benefit and Profit-Sharing Plans The Company has a defined contribution 401K plan. All
employees over the age of 21 who have completed at least ninety
days of service are eligible to participate. Each participant
may elect to have amounts deducted from his or her compensation
and contribute to the plan up to the maximum amount as specified
by the Federal law. All employee contributions are fully vested
at the time the employee becomes an active participant. The
Companys matching contributions are equal to 50% of
pre-tax contributions, up to 3% of eligible pay. This match is
distributed to all eligible employees participating in the plan.
The matching contribution is paid quarterly. The Companys
matching contributions were approximately $559,000, $157,000 667,000 and $506,000 for the year ended December31, 2002,
the three-month period ended March31, 2003 and the years
ended March31, 2004 and 2005, respectively.   
12.
Segment Information and Geographic Information The Company operates in one reportable segment, service delivery
management SDM and sells software products and
services offerings to enable the three principal components of
SDM: asset management, customer management and field service
management. Neither the acquisition of IUS nor the acquisition
of Wishbone Systems, Inc. Wishbone resulted in a
new business segment for the Company. Geographic revenue information for the year ended
December31, 2002, the three-month period ended
March31, 2003, and the years ended March31, 2004 and
2005 is based on customer location, and is shown in thousands.
In prior periods, geographic revenue information has been shown
by selling location. The Company believes that providing this
data by customer location aligns more closely with the way the
business is managed. Prior period data have been restated to
reflect this revision. Long-lived asset information is based on
the physical location of the assets.

The net valuation allowance increased by approximately
$66million and $31million for the years ended
March31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Approximately
$22million of the valuation allowance for the deferred
tax asset at March31, 2005 relates to benefits of stock
option deductions which, when recognized, will be directly
allocated to contributed capital. As of March31, 2005, the Company had federal net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $672million. The
Company also had federal research tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $96million and state research tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $08million. The federal
net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire
beginning in the year 2020, if not utilized. The Company has
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$161million. The Company has provided a tax accrual of
$33million for potential tax liabilities related
primarily to its non-US operations. The Company has determined that utilization of the net operating
losses and credits is likely to be subject to annual limitations
due to a greater than 50% change in the Companys ownership
during the three-year period ending in fiscal year 2005, under
the change in ownership provisions of
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
provisions. These limitations may result in the expiration of
net operating losses and credits before utilization.
Determination of the annual limitations is a complex process and
is presently being calculated by the Companys tax
consultant.

Litigation On February21, 2003, Integral Energy Australia brought a
claim against IUS in the Supreme Court of New South Wales,
Australia, relating to the implementation of IUS software. The
amount of damages asserted against IUS is not determinable.
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement among the
Company and SCT and its affiliates, SCT and those affiliates of
SCT that were a party to the Purchase Agreement agreed to defend
IUS against the claims in this suit and to indemnify the Company
and IUS from all losses relating thereto. From time to time, the Company is involved in other legal
proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The
outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty. The
Company intends to defend itself vigorously in these actions.
However, any settlement or judgment may have a material adverse
effect on 73 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or
financial condition.   
15.
Acquisitions   
IUS On March5, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of
IUS, a provider of customer relationship management software
products for energy and utility companies principally in North
America. The aggregate purchase price of $358million was
financed with a cash payment of $245million, a
$100million 6% promissory note to SCT Financial
Corporation secured by IUS real property, and payment of other
direct acquisition expenses totaling $14million,
comprised of $08million in debt issuance costs and
$06million in equity issuance costs. The acquisition has
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and
the results of operations are included in the Companys
operations beginning March6, 2003. On the same date, the Company completed a private placement
offering to purchasers of approximately 68million shares
of the Companys common stock, par value $0001per
share, at a purchase price of $150per share, or a total
of approximately $102million, and issued approximately
$145million of the Companys 8%Convertible
Notes due nine months after issuance in order to fund the IUS
acquisition. The Convertible Notes were converted into
9,751,859shares of the Companys common stock on
July29, 2003. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the

As restated, see Note2 Prior to the acquisition date, the Company began formulating a
plan to restructure pre-acquisition IUS through staffing
reductions. In connection with this plan, the Company recorded a
liability of $675,000 representing anticipated severance costs
for approximately 50 employees of IUS in various job functions.
These costs are accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue
No95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection
with Purchase Business Combinations. The costs were
recognized as a liability assumed in the purchase business
combination and included in the allocation of the cost to
acquire IUS. As of March31, 2005, no liability remains as
$508,000 in cash payments have been made in connection with
these terminations and the remaining accrual balance of $167,000
was reversed and applied as an adjustment to goodwill.   
Wishbone On January21, 2004, the Company acquired Wishbone for an
aggregate purchase price of $86million, including a cash
payment of $67million, the assumption of
$10million of Wishbone debt, payment of direct
acquisition expenses of $05million and conversion of
Wishbone employee stock options of $04million. The
Company financed the acquisition purchase price and acquisition
expenses and concurrently repaid the debt with cash from
currently available funds. $10million of the purchase
price was directed to an escrow account which, subject to any
claims asserted by the Company, was released to the seller on
November30, 2004. Wishbone is a provider of field service
management and optimization software. 75 Table of Contents INDUS INTERNATIONALS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

employees to Atlanta, GA and for other expenses, including a
working capital adjustment calculation. The Company has not disclosed pro forma consolidated operating

Controls and Procedures Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form10-K are
certifications of the Companys Chief Executive Officer
CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO,
which are required in accordance with Rule13a-14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This Controls
and Procedures section includes information concerning the
controls and controls evaluation referred to in the
certifications. Managements assessment of internal control
over financial reporting is set forth below in this section. The
report of Ernst Young LLP, independent registered
public accounting firm, regarding its audit of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting and of
managements assessment of internal control over financial
reporting is also set forth below. This section should be read
in conjunction with the certifications and the Ernst
Young report for a more complete understanding of the topics
presented. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in its reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management, including its CEO
and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management, with the participation of the
CEO and CFO of the Company, has performed an evaluation of the
design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures as of March31, 2005. Based on that
evaluation and the matters discussed below, the CEO and CFO of
the Company concluded that the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of March31,
2005, as a result of the material weakness described below in
Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Under
section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management
is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its
most recent fiscal year and report, based on that assessment,
whether the Companys internal control over financial
reporting is effective. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of published financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or
detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of March31,
2005. In making its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of
the Treadway Commission in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. The COSO framework includes five
interrelated components of internal control: control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information
and communication and monitoring of each of the above criteria. In performing this assessment, management reviewed the
Companys accounting practices for leases and leasehold
improvements as a result of views expressed by the Office of the
Chief Accountant of the SEC in a February7, 2005 letter to
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding
certain lease accounting issues and their applicability under
generally accepted accounting principles. As a result of this 78 Table of Contents review, management concluded that the Companys controls
over the selection and application of its accounting policies
related to leasehold improvements, tenant allowances and
operating leases with scheduled escalating rental payments were
ineffective to ensure such transactions were recorded in
accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles. The leases to which these accounting policies
applied were entered into in 2000. As a result of these ineffective controls, on May10, 2005,
we determined to restate certain of our previously issued
financial statements to reflect the correction in the
Companys accounting practices for leases and leasehold
improvements, including corrections affecting the property and
equipment, deferred rent liability, rent expense, depreciation
expense and restructuring expense accounts. See Item8,
Note2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements entitled
Restatement of Financial Statements for Accounting for
Leases and Leasehold Improvements for further discussion
of the impact of restatement. The restatement includes
corrections to rent expense to record such expense equally over
the terms of the leases. The corrections have the effect of
increasing rent expense in the early years of a lease agreement
containing rent escalations. The restatement also includes an
increase in the useful lives of certain leasehold improvements
to correspond with the lease terms of the property. The increase
in useful lives has the effect of decreasing periodic
depreciation expense. A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
is a significant deficiency within the meaning of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB Auditing
Standard No2, or combination of significant
deficiencies, that results in there being more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. PCAOB
Auditing Standard No2 identifies a number of
circumstances that, because of their likely significant negative
effect on internal control over financial reporting, are to be
regarded as at least significant deficiencies as well as strong
indicators that a material weakness exists, including the
restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect
the correction of a misstatement. Management evaluated the
impact of the restatement of the Companys previously
issued financial statements on the Companys assessment of
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting and concluded that the ineffective controls over the
selection and application of its accounting policies related to
leasehold improvements, tenant allowances and operating leases
with scheduled escalating rental payments resulted in the
above-described errors in accounting for leases and leasehold
improvements represented a material weakness. Solely as a result
of the material weakness related to the accounting for leasehold
improvements, tenant allowances and operating leases with
escalating rental payments, management has concluded that, as of
March31, 2005, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria set
forth by the COSO of the Treadway Commission in Internal
Control Integrated Framework. 79 Table of Contents The Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued a report on
managements assessment of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. This report appears below. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Indus International, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, that Indus International, Inc. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March31, 2005, because of the effect of the material
weakness identified in managements assessment related to
ineffective controls over the selection and application of its
accounting policies related to leasehold improvements, tenant
allowances and operating leases with scheduled escalating rental
payments, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the
COSO criteria. Indus International, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weakness has been identified and included in
managements assessment. As of March31, 2005,
management has identified as a material weakness that the
Companys insufficient controls over the selection and
application of its accounting policies related to leasehold
improvements, tenant allowances and operating leases with
scheduled escalating rental payments. As a result of this
material weakness, management failed to identify misstatements
in property and equipment, deferred rent liability, rent expense
and depreciation expense, which resulted in restatements of the
Companys annual consolidated financial statements as of
March31, 2004 and for the year ended December31,
2002, for the 80 Table of Contents three months ended March31, 2003, for the year ended
March31, 2004 and the interim consolidated financial
statements for each of the quarterly periods in the years ended
March31, 2004 and 2005. This material weakness was
considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of
audit tests applied in our audit of the 2005 financial
statements, and this report does not affect our report dated
June10, 2005 on those financial statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that Indus
International, Inc. did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO control
criteria. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the
material weakness described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, Indus International, Inc.
has not maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March31, 2005, based on the COSO control
criteria.   
/s/ Ernst Young LLP Atlanta, Georgia 
June10, 2005 81 Table of Contents Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control. To remediate the material weakness in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting, the Company has
conducted and completed a review of its accounting practices for
leases and leasehold improvements and corrected its method of
accounting. Additionally the Company has implemented an improved
contract review process, including internal controls that will
help identify similar issues in the future and help ensure
proper accounting treatment. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO of the
Company, has evaluated any changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the most recent fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation,
management, the CEO and the CFO of the Company have concluded
that there were no changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal
quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. However, subsequent to March31, 2005,
the Company has made the changes described under
Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls. The Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, does
not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the control systems objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.
