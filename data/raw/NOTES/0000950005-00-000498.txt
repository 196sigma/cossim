ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of BroadVision, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of BroadVision,
Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BroadVision,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 1999
Note 1 -- Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business
BroadVision, Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company was
incorporated in the state of Delaware on May 13, 1993. The Company develops,
markets and supports application software solutions specifically designed for
one-to-one relationship  management across an extended enterprise.  These
solutions enable businesses to use the Internet as a platform to conduct
electronic commerce, provide online customer self-service, deliver targeted
information to constituents and provide online financial services. Each of these
capabilities can be made available to all constituents of the extended
enterprise,  including:  customers,  suppliers, partners, distributors and
employees. The BroadVision One-To-One product suite empowers businesses to
uniquely tailor Web site content to the needs and interests of individual users
by personalizing each constituent visit on a real-time interactive basis. The
Company applications accomplish this by interactively capturing Web site
visitor profile information and targeting organized content of an enterprise to
each visitor based on easily constructed business rules.
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain
assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
estimates.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue recognition policies are in accordance with Statement
of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. In general,
software license revenues are recognized when a non-cancelable license agreement
has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to
pay, the software product has been delivered, there are no uncertainties
surrounding product acceptance, the fees are fixed and determinable, and
collection is considered probable; professional services revenues are recognized
as such services are performed; and maintenance revenues, including revenues
bundled with software agreements which entitle the customers to technical
support and future unspecified enhancements to the Company products, are
deferred and recognized ratably over the related contract period, generally
twelve months. Revenues recognized from multiple-element software arrangements
are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the
elements, such as software products, upgrades, enhancements, post contract
customer support, installation, or training. The determination of fair value is
based on objective evidence which is specific to the Company.
The Company records unearned revenue for software arrangements when cash has
been received from the customer and the arrangement does not qualify for revenue
recognition under the Company revenue recognition policy. The Company records
accounts receivable for software arrangements when the arrangement qualifies for
revenue recognition and cash or other consideration has not been received from
the customer.
In December 1998, AcSEC issued SOP 98-9 Software Revenue Recognition, With
Respect to Certain Transactions, which requires recognition of revenue using the
residual method in a multiple-element arrangement when fair value does not
exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the
residual method, the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred
and subsequently recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2. There was no material
change to the Company accounting for revenues as a result of the provisions of
SOP 98-9.                    46 Research and Development and Software Development Costs
Under the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 86,  Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software to be Sold,
leased or Otherwise Marketed,  development costs incurred in the research and
development  of new software  products  are expensed as incurred  until
technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established at
which time such costs are capitalized, subject to recoverability. Products are
made available for limited release,  concurrent with the achievement of
technological feasibility. Accordingly, software development costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been
significant, and the Company has not capitalized any software development costs
to date.
Prepaid Royalties
Prepaid royalties relating to purchased software to be incorporated and sold
with the Company software products are amortized as a cost of revenue either
on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the royalty agreement or on
the basis of projected product  revenues,  whichever results in greater
amortization.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all debt securities with remaining maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company
cash equivalents consisted of the following in thousands                            December 31,
1998     1999
Cash                  $ 1,978   $ 16,945
Money market funds.     48,900   125,807
Commercial paper.     11,000   137,071
$ 61,878   $279,823
Short-term Investments
The Company short-term investments consist of marketable equity and debt
securities that are classified as available-for-sale. The Company investment
in marketable equity securities is carried at fair value with related unrealized
gains or losses reported as other comprehensive income, net of tax. As of
December 31, 1999, the Company investment in marketable equity securities had
a fair value of $48,642,000 and a cost basis of $5,348,000. The Company debt
securities are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value. As of
December 31, 1999, debt security investments consisted of $9,700,000 with
maturities of approximately one year and $10,416,000 of mutual bond funds.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial assets that potentially  subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, and trade accounts receivable. The Company markets and
sells its products throughout the world and performs ongoing credit evaluations
of its customers. The Company generally does not require collateral on accounts
receivable as the majority of its customers are large, well-established
companies. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses but
historically has not experienced any significant losses related to individual
customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt. The Company does
not have any derivative financial instruments. The Company believes the reported
carrying amounts of its financial instruments approximates fair value, based
upon the short                    47 maturity of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and
payable, and based on the current rates available to the Company on similar debt
issues.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives two to five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the corresponding lease term or their estimated
useful lives, whichever is shorter.
The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the property and equipment exceeds its fair market value.
Long-term Investments
As of December 31, 1999, long-term investments consist of non-marketable
equity securities. As of December 31, 1998, long-term investments consist of
non-marketable equity securities and a marketable equity securities investment
carrying value of $8,546,000.
The Company accounts for its non-marketable equity security investments based
on the cost method as the Company does not have the ability to significantly
influence the operating and financial policies of its investees. Any decline in
value, which is other than a temporary decline, is charged to earnings during
the period in which the impairment occurs. The Company classifies its marketable
equity security investments as available for sale. Accordingly, marketable
equity security investments are recorded at fair value with related unrealized
gains or losses reported as other comprehensive income.
As of December 31, 1998, the Company investment in marketable equity
securities had a fair value of $8,546,000 and a cost basis of $5,348,000. As of
December 31, 1999, this investment has been classified as a short-term
investment.
Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax Liabilities
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are established to recognize the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years
in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effects on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Employee Stock Option and Purchase Plans
The Company accounts for employee stock-based awards in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As such, compensation
expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. Pursuant to SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company discloses the pro forma
effects of using the fair value method of accounting  for  stock-based
compensation arrangements.
Stock Splits
On September 29, 1999, the Company Board of Directors  declared a
three-for-one  common stock split in the form of a stock dividend for
Stockholders of record as of October 11, 1999. The stock dividend payment date
was                    48 October 25, 1999 and the Company common stock traded ex-dividend starting
October 26, 1999, reflecting the three-for-one stock split.
Subsequently, on February 8, 2000, the Company Board of Directors declared
an additional three-for-one common stock split in the form of a stock dividend
for Stockholders of record as of February 21, 2000. The stock dividend payment
date was March 13, 2000 and the Company common stock traded ex-dividend
starting March 14, 2000, reflecting the additional three-for-one stock split.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related financial
information contained herein have been retroactively restated to give effect for
the September 1999 and February 2000 stock splits. Per Share Information
Basic earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings loss per share is
computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares from outstanding stock options and
warrants using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the
basic and diluted earnings loss per share computational data for the periods
presented. Excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the
year ended December 31, 1997, are options to acquire 33,318,000 shares of common
stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $049 and warrants to acquire
843,750 shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $068
because their effects would be anti-dilutive.                            Years Ended December 31,

Foreign Currency Transactions
The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the U.S.
dollar. Resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and, to date, have not been significant.
Comprehensive Income Loss
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income effective
January 1, 1998. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting and
disclosure of comprehensive income loss and its components. Comprehensive
income loss includes all changes in equity during a period except those
resulting from investments by or distributions to owners.
For the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company had no other significant
components of other comprehensive loss. Accordingly, comprehensive loss and net
loss were the same for this period. For the years ended December 31, 1998 and
1999, comprehensive income was $7,237,000 and $ 41,536,000, respectively. The
components of other comprehensive income for these periods relate solely to
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments.
49 Reclassifications
Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 137, effective for
all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Accordingly,
the Company will adopt SFAS No. 133 beginning on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133,
as amended, establishes standards for the accounting and reporting of derivative
instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts.
Under SFAS No. 133, entities are required to carry all derivative instruments
at fair value on their balance sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair
value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument depends on whether it
has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging activity and the
underlying purpose for it. The Company does not believe that the adoption of
SFAS No. 133 will have a significant impact on the Company consolidated
financial statements or related disclosures.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies. The Company
will adopt SAB 101 effective April 1, 2000, as required. Management does not
expect the adoption of SAB 101 to have any material effect on the financial
position or results of the operations of the Company.
Note 2 -- Acquired Business  On November 24, 1999, the Company acquired all of the registered shares of
Fidutec Information Technology SA for a cash payment of 6,000,000 Swiss Francs
equivalent U.S. dollar value of $3,765,000, net of cash acquired; of which
1,200,000 Swiss Francs are held in escrow, subject to employee retention
conditions lasting 12 to 24 months depending on named employees. The acquisition
was accounted for as a purchase. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities,
and the related results of operations, are included in the consolidated
financial statements of the Company from the date of acquisition. The name of
the acquired business has been subsequently changed to BroadVision Professional
Services. The purchase price was allocated based on fair values as follows in

Note 5 -- Long-term Debt
The Company has various credit facilities with a commercial lender which
include term debt in the form of notes payable and a revolving line of credit
that provides for up to $5,000,000 of additional borrowings based on eligible
accounts receivable. As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, outstanding term debt
borrowings were $3,472,000 and $5,852,000, respectively.  Borrowings bear
interest at the bank prime rate 775% and 850% as of December 31, 1998 and
1999, respectively. Principal and interest is due in consecutive monthly
payments through maturity based on the term of the facility. Principal payments
of $977,000 are due annually from 2000 through 2004, $611,000 due in 2005, and a
final payment of $357,000 due in 2006.
As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company had no outstanding borrowings
under its revolving line of credit. However, commitments totaling $2,196,000 and
$2,820,000, in the form of standby letters of credit were issued under its
revolving line of credit facility as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively
see Note 7.
The commercial credit facilities include covenants which impose certain
restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions and requires
the Company to maintain monthly financial covenants, including a minimum quick
ratio, tangible net worth ratio and debt service coverage ratio. Borrowings are
collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company
owned assets. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of
December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1999.
Note 6 -- Income Taxes
Income before taxes includes losses from foreign operations of approximately
$1,567,000 and $2,906,000 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998,
respectively, and income of $1,068,000 for the year ending December 31, 1999.

The Company has provided a valuation allowance for a significant portion of
its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1999. The total valuation allowance
increased $15,383,000 from December 31, 1998 to December 31, 1999. Approximately
$15,075,000 of the valuation allowance relating to income tax benefits arising
from the exercise of stock options will be credited directly to stockholders'
equity and will not be available to benefit the income tax provision in any
future periods. In 1998, as a result of the intraperiod income tax allocation
provisions of SFAS No. 109, the deferred tax liability related to the unrealized
gain on marketable securities decreased the valuation allowance for the deferred
tax assets and was not charged to accumulated other comprehensive income in
stockholders' equity for that period.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $47,241,000 and $16,952,000,  respectively,
available to offset future regular and alternative minimum taxable income. In
addition, the Company had federal and state research and development credit
carryforwards  of approximately  $2,983,000 and $1,207,000,  respectively,
available to offset future tax liabilities. The Company federal net operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards expire in the years 2010 through 2019, if not
utilized. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2000
through 2019. The state research and development credits can be carried forward
indefinitely. As of December 31, 1999, the Company foreign subsidiaries had
