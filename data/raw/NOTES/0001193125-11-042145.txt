CECONYs capital expenditures for environmental protection facilities and related studies were $133 million and $148 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and are
estimated to be $167 million in 2011. c
For 2008, 2009 and 2010, includes long-term securities redeemed in advance of maturity. 
The Utilities have an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to
meet the growth in demand for electricity, and electric, gas and steam reliability needs.  The estimated capital expenditures for the competitive energy businesses reflect potential investments in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects and could significantly increase or
decrease from the amounts estimated depending on market conditions and opportunities.  Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Companies material
obligations at December31, 2010 to make payments pursuant to contracts. Long-term debt, capital lease obligations and other long-term liabilities are included on their balance sheets. Operating leases and electricity purchase agreements for

Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated at rates in effect at December31, 2010. b
Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of energy that the company is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. c
Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and
variable prices. d
Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were
derived from the Utilities purchasing systems as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid or vouchered to be paid for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than
the amount authorized. Payments for the Other Purchase Obligations are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to modify their
purchasing systems to enable them to report their Other Purchase Obligations in a different manner. e
Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, renewable energy certificates, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity, energy
efficiency services and construction services entered into by Con Edisons competitive energy businesses. 
The Companies commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance
sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edisons guarantees of certain obligations of its businesses. See Notes E, F,
O and Guarantees in Note H to the financial statements in Item8. Capital Resources 
Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con
Edison expects to finance its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and the sale of its securities, including meeting all of its common equity needs in 2011 by issuing shares under its dividend reinvestment and employee
stock plans. Con Edisons ability to make payments on its external borrowings and dividends on its common shares is also dependent on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in
its subsidiaries. For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C
to the financial statements in Item8. For information on the Companies commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements
with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item8. The Utilities expect to finance their operations, capital requirements and
payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds see Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows from Operating Activities in Item7, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison and external borrowings,
including the issuance in 2011 of long-term debt of up to $600 million. The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital
requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally-generated funds. See Capital Requirements, above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market conditions
may affect the timing of the Companies financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous
to do so. For information about the Companies long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item8. 
27 Table of Contents
In 2009, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY and OR to issue up to $4,800 million and $500 million of
securities, respectively of which up to $550 million and $100 million, respectively, may be preferred stock and up to the entire amount authorized may be debt securities. At December31, 2010, CECONY and OR had issued $1,470 million and
$190 million, respectively, of debt securities pursuant to such authorization. In addition, the NYSPSC has authorized the Utilities to refund outstanding debt securities and preferred stock should the Utilities determine that it is economic to
do so. Con Edisons competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital
contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings. For each of the Companies, the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges SEC basis for the last five years was:  Earnings to Fixed Charges Times 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Con Edison 30 34 34 30 33 CECONY 32 36 33 31 34

The
commercial paper of the Companies is rated P-2, A-2 and F2, respectively, by Moodys, SP and Fitch. Con Edisons long-term credit rating is Baa1, BBB+ and BBB+, respectively, by Moodys, SP and Fitch. The unsecured debt of
CECONY is rated A3, A- and A-, respectively, by Moodys, SP and Fitch. The unsecured debt of OR is rated Baa1, A- and A-, respectively, by Moodys, SP and Fitch. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are
expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other
rating. CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this
amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc. Credit rating agencies have downgraded the ratings of these insurers from AAA to lower levels.
Subsequently, there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average annual interest rate on this tax-exempt debt
was 054 percent on December31, 2010. The weighted average interest rate was 045 percent, 080 percent and 394 percent for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Under CECONYs current gas and steam and beginning in April 2011
electric rate orders, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels set in rates. Environmental
Matters Climate Change 
As indicated in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing
the worlds climate. Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies energy services. The effects of climate change
might also include physical damage to the Companies facilities and disruption of their operations due to the impact of more extreme weather-related events. Based on the most recent data 2008published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA, Con Edison estimates that its greenhouse gas emissions constitute less than 01 percent of the
nations greenhouse gas emissions. Con Edisons emissions of greenhouse gases during the past five years expressed in terms of millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent were: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 CO2 equivalent
emissions 54 53 46 42 43
28 Table of Contents
The 35 percent decrease in Con Edisons greenhouse gas emissions since 2005 66 million tons
reflects the emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, including projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions, and increased use of natural gas at CECONYs steam production facilities. Emissions from electric
generation at the Con Edison Development electric generating plants which were sold in 2008 see Note U to the financial statements in Item8 have been removed from the above data for 2008 and prior years. 
The Companies are working to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to
reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure,
and by introducing new technologies. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks, and by replacing
older equipment. The Utilities also promote energy efficiency programs for customers that help them reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. 
Beginning in 2009, CECONY is subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New York State under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
The initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, establishes a decreasing cap on carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity to a level ten percent below the Initiatives baseline by 2018.
Under the initiative, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions administered by participating states or a secondary market. 
The EPA has started regulating greenhouse gas emissions from major sources. Also, New York State has announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and New York City plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the City 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies
greenhouse gas emissions could be substantial. Environmental Sustainability Con Edison seeks to improve the environmental sustainability of its businesses. CECONY is piloting smart grid technologies to demonstrate the interoperability of distributed generation and the exchange of
information between customers and utilities. The smart grid will give customers the tools to be smarter consumers of energy and will allow the utility to more quickly identify and isolate problems. The company recycles clean non-hazardous waste
materials in more than a dozen categories and recycled more than 59,000 tons of waste in 2009. More than 40 percent of the companys vehicles are now using alternative-energy technology. New environmentally friendly white roofs are in place at
the corporate headquarters and more than 20 other facilities, and others are underway. A white roof reflects sunlight, lowering indoor temperatures on hot days, which reduces the need to cool the building, resulting in fewer carbon dioxide
emissions. CECONY Superfund The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes Superfund impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to
which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, its former Arthur Kill electric generation plant site, its former
Flushing Service Center site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims

investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
Manufactured Gas Sites 
CECONY and its predecessors formerly manufactured gas and maintained storage holders for gas manufactured at sites in New York City and Westchester County
MGP Sites. Many of these sites are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped by them for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation NYSDEC requires the company to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, which include 34 manufactured gas plant sites and 17 storage holder sites and any neighboring areas to which
contamination may have migrated. The information available to CECONY for many of the MGP Sites is incomplete as to the extent of contamination
and scope of the remediation likely to be required. Through the end of 2010, investigations have been started for all or portions of all 51 MGP Sites, and have been completed at 23 of the sites. Coal tar and/or other manufactured gas
production/storage-related environmental contaminants have been detected at 36 MGP Sites, including locations within Manhattan and other parts of New York City, and in Westchester County. Remediation has been completed at six sites and portions of
six other sites. Astoria Site CECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property the company owns in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location
of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of
electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to conduct corrective action to remediate the contamination. The
company has investigated various sections of the property and is performing additional investigations. The company has submitted to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The
company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property will be at least $38 million. Arthur Kill Site Following a September 1998 transformer fire at
CECONYs former Arthur Kill Generating Station, it was determined that oil containing high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs was released to the environment during the incident. The company has completed NYSDEC-approved cleanup
programs for the stations facilities and various soil and pavement areas of the site affected by the PCB release. Pursuant to a July 1999 NYSDEC consent order, the company completed a NYSDEC-approved assessment of the nature and extent of the
contamination in the waterfront area of the station. The NYSDEC selected a remediation program for the waterfront area, and the company has implemented it pursuant to an additional consent order entered into during 2005. Field work associated with
the waterfront remediation program has been completed and a final engineering report has been submitted to and approved by the NYSDEC. In 2010, the NYSDEC informed the company that additional remediation is required in upland areas. The company
estimates that its undiscounted potential future liability for additional upland remediation, site monitoring, maintenance, and reporting to the NYSDEC will be approximately $02 million. Flushing Service Center Site The owner of a former CECONY service center
facility in Flushing, New York, informed the company that PCB contamination had been detected on a substantial portion of the property, which the owner remediated pursuant to the New York State Brownfield Cleanup Program administered by the
30 Table of Contents
NYSDEC and is redeveloping for residential and commercial use. The property owners claim against the company for the cost of its environmental response costs for the site has been resolved.
In September 2007, the NYSDEC demanded that the company investigate and remediate PCB contamination that may have migrated into the adjacent Flushing River from the site. In April 2008, the company and NYSDEC entered into a consent order under which
the company has agreed to implement a NYSDEC-approved investigation program for the Flushing River and, if deemed necessary by the NYSDEC to protect human health and the environment from such contamination, to implement a NYSDEC-approved remediation
program for any PCB contamination in the river attributable to the site. At this time, the company cannot estimate its liability for the investigation and cleanup of any PCB contamination that may have migrated to the Flushing River from the site,
but such liability may be substantial. Gowanus Canal In August 2009, CECONY received a notice of potential liability and request for information from the EPA about the operations of the company and its predecessors at sites adjacent or near the 18 mile
Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York. The company understands that the EPA also has provided or will provide notices of potential liability and information requests to other parties. In March 2010, the EPA added the Gowanus Canal to its National
Priorities List of Superfund sites. The canals adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses, and parking lots, and the canal is near several residential neighborhoods. In
February 2011, the EPA released a report of its remedial investigation that confirmed there is significant contamination in the Gowanus Canal. The company expects that the cost of assessment and remediation of hazardous substances in and around the
Gowanus Canal will be substantial. CECONY is unable to predict its exposure to liability with respect to the Gowanus Canal site. Other Superfund Sites CECONY is a potentially responsible party PRP with
respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and where it is generally not responsible for managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some
of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions,
such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites. The following table lists each of
CECONYs other Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have a liability. The table also shows for each such site, its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have
responsibilities with respect to the site shown in the table under Start, the name of the court or agency in which proceedings with respect to the site are pending and CECONYs estimated percentage of total liability for each
site. The company currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is less than $200,000, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site, for which the estimate is
$12 million and the Curcio Scrap Metal site, for which the estimate is $04 million. Superfund liability is joint and several. The companys estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement
agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The companys actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.  Site

OR Superfund The sites at which OR has been asserted to have liability
under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites, its West Nyack site, the Newark Bay site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that OR has liability. For a further
discussion of claims and possible claims against OR under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item8 which information is incorporated herein by reference. Manufactured Gas Sites OR and its predecessors formerly owned and
operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites OR MGP Sites in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than OR, and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or
industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring OR to develop and implement remediation programs for the OR MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated. 
Through the end of 2010, OR has completed remedial investigations at all seven OR MGP Sites OR has completed the remediation at one of its
sites; has completed the NYSDEC-approved remediation program for the land portion of its Nyack site; and has received NYSDECs decision regarding the remedial work to be done at two other sites. Remedial design is ongoing for two of the sites
and will be initiated in 2011 for the shoreline/sediment portion of the Nyack site. Feasibility studies are expected to be completed in 2011 for the remaining sites. West Nyack Site In 1994 and 1997, OR entered into consent orders with
the NYSDEC pursuant to which OR agreed to conduct a remedial investigation and remediate certain property it owns in West Nyack, New York at which PCBs were discovered. Petroleum contamination related to a leaking underground storage tank was
found as well. OR has completed all remediation at the site that the NYSDEC has required to date. OR is continuing a supplemental groundwater investigation and on-site vapor intrusion monitoring as required by the NYSDEC. 
Newark Bay 
Approximately 300 parties, including OR which was served with a third-party complaint in June 2009, were sued as third-party defendants by Tierra
Solutions, Inc. Tierra and Maxus Energy Corporation Maxus, successors to the Occidental Chemical Corporation and Diamond Shamrock Chemical Company. Tierra and Maxus were themselves sued in 2005 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and others for removal and cleanup costs, punitive damages, penalties, and economic losses allegedly arising from the dioxin contamination their predecessors pesticide/herbicide plant allegedly released to the Newark Bay
Complex, a system of waterways including Newark Bay, the Arthur Kill, the Kill Van Kull, and lower portions of the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers. Tierra and Maxus are seeking equitable contribution from the third-party defendants for such
costs, damages, penalties and losses, which are likely to be substantial. As to OR, Tierra and Maxus allege that 1975 and 1976 shipments of waste oil by OR from an electricity generating plant in Haverstraw, New York to the Borne Chemical
Company in Elizabeth, New Jersey was a source of petroleum discharges to the Arthur Kill. Con Edison is unable to predict ORs exposure to liability with respect to the Newark Bay Complex. 
Other Superfund Sites 
OR is a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites where there are other PRPs and it is not managing the site investigation and remediation. Work at
these sites is in various stages, with the company participating in PRP groups at some of the sites. Investigation, remediation and monitoring at some of these sites have been, and are expected to continue to be, conducted over extended periods of
time. The company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed upon it by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions Toxic Substances Control Act 
Virtually all electric utilities, including CECONY, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of
1976. Water Quality Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONYs service area. Governmental authorities
could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial. Air Quality Under new source review regulations, an owner of a large
generating facility, including CECONYs steam and steam-electric generating facilities, is required to obtain a permit before making modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that increase emissions
of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain a permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis
its planned modifications to its generating facilities to determine the potential applicability of new source review and similar regulations. In July 2010, revised New York State nitrogen oxides reasonably available control technology regulations
became effective. The EPA is expected to adopt regulations in February 2011 establishing maximum achievable control technology standards for industrial boilers. The regulations apply to major air emissions sources, including CECONYs generating
facilities. CECONY anticipates that additional regulations will be adoptedrequiring further reductions in air emissions. CECONYs plans to comply with the regulations include the modification by 2014 of certain of its generating
facilities to enable the facilities to increase the use of natural gas, decreasing the use of fuel oil. For information about the companys generating facilities, see CECONY Electric Operations Electric Facilities and
Steam Operations Steam Facilities above in this Item1. The company is unable to predict the impact of these regulations on its operations or the additional costs, which could be substantial, it could incur to comply with the
regulations. State Anti-Takeover Law New York State law provides that a domestic corporation, such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or
greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the
corporations board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent fair price formula or with the
approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders.

influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The Companies have established an enterprise risk management program to identify, assess, and manage its major operations and administrative risks based on established criteria for the severity of an
event, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the programs in place to control the event or reduce the impact. The Companies also have financial and commodity market risks. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks in Item7.
The Companies major risks include: The Failure to Operate Energy Facilities Safely and Reliably Could Adversely Affect The Companies. The Utilities provide electricity, gas and steam service using energy facilities, many of which are located either in, or close to, densely populated public places. See the description of the
