2006 and July31, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income,

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of United Natural Foods,Inc. and subsidiaries as of July29,
2006 and July31, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended July29,
2006 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of United Natural Foods,Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of July29, 2006, based on criteria established in

Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated October6,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
aNature of
Business
United Natural Foods,Inc.
and Subsidiaries the Company is a distributor and retailer of natural and
organic products. The Company sells its products primarily throughout the
United States.
bBasis of
Presentation
The accompanying financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
years presentation.
Effective August1, 2005, the Company changed the
fiscal periods in its fiscal year to end on the Saturday closest to July31.
As such, fiscal 2006 ended on July29, 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, which
ended on July31, 2005. This change in fiscal year end did not have a
material impact on the Companys operations.
On March17, 2004, the Companys Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Companys common stock that was
payable in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders received one additional
share of the Companys common stock for each share of common stock held on the
record date of March29, 2004. The split became effective on April20,
2004. The applicable share and per-share data for all periods included herein
have been restated to give effect to this stock split. The par value of the
common stock was not affected by the stock split and remains at $001 per
share.
Net sales consist
primarily of sales of natural and organic products to retailers adjusted for
customer volume discounts, returns and allowances. Net sales also consist of
amounts due to the Company from customers for shipping and handling, and fuel
surcharges. The principal components of cost of sales include the amount paid
to manufacturers and growers for product sold, plus the cost of transportation
necessary to bring the product to the Companys distribution facilities. Cost
of sales also includes amounts incurred by the Company for shipping and
handling, depreciation for manufacturing equipment at the Companys
manufacturing segment, Hershey Import Company,Inc. Hershey Imports
and consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or
promotion of the suppliers products. Operating expenses include salaries and
wages, employee benefits including payments under the Companys Employee Stock
Ownership Plan, warehousing and delivery, selling, occupancy, insurance, administrative,
share-based compensation and amortization expense. Operating expenses also
includes depreciation expense related to the wholesale and retail segments.
Other expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness, interest
income, and the change in fair value of financial instruments and miscellaneous
income and expenses.
cCash
Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist
of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
dInventories
and Cost of Sales
Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, with
cost being determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Allowances
received from suppliers are recorded as reductions in cost of sales upon the
sale of the related products. 41 eProperty
and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Equipment under capital leases is
stated at the lower of the present value of minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease or the fair value of the asset. Depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis,
over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, when applicable, the life of
the lease, whichever is shorter. Applicable interest charges incurred during
the construction of new facilities is capitalized as one of the elements of
cost and is amortized over the assets estimated useful lives. Interest
capitalized for each of the years ended July29, 2006 and July31,
2005 was $05 million. There was no interest capitalized in the year ended July31,
2004.
Property

fIncome
Taxes
The Company accounts for
income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
gIntangible
Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets consist principally of goodwill and
covenants not to compete. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over
fair value of net assets acquired in connection with purchase business
combinations. Covenants not to compete are initially recorded at fair value and
are amortized using the straight-line method over the lives of the respective
agreements, generally four to five years.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
requires that companies test goodwill for impairment at least annually and
between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
amount. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests for indications of
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment losses
are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted
expected future cash flows of the underlying business. The assessment of the
recoverability of long-lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash
flows are not  42 achieved. For reporting
units that indicate potential impairment, the Company determines the implied
fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and
compares such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts.
As of July29, 2006, the Companys annual
assessment of each of its reporting units indicated that no impairment of
goodwill existed. Total goodwill as of July29, 2006 was $780 million.
The Company recorded additional goodwill in the wholesale segment of
approximately $164 million during the year ended July31, 2005 as a
result of the acquisitions of Select Nutrition Distributors $70 million and
Roots Fruits Cooperative Produce $94 million.
Other intangibles consist of covenants not to compete
and supply agreements with a weighted average amortization period of 23 years.
The Company had other intangibles and related accumulated amortization of $07
million and $05 million at July29, 2006, respectively, and $05 million
and $02million at July31, 2005, respectively. Amortization expense
was $06 million, $07 million and $13million for the years ended July29,
2006, July31, 2005 and July31, 2004, respectively.
Estimated
amortization expense for the next three fiscal years is as follows

hRevenue
Recognition and Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company records revenue upon delivery of products.
Revenues are recorded net of applicable sales discounts and estimated sales
returns. Sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for as reductions
in revenue as the related revenue is recorded. The Companys sales are
primarily with customers located throughout the United States.
In the years ended July29, 2006 and July31,
2005, two customers, Whole Foods Market,Inc. Whole Foods Market and
Wild Oats Markets,Inc. Wild Oats Markets, generated 10% or more of
the Companys net sales. In the year ended July31, 2004, one customer,
Whole Foods Market, generated more than 10% of the Companys net sales. Net
sales to Whole Foods Market were approximately 26% of net sales in 2006, 2005
and 2004. Wild Oats Markets represented approximately 10% and 11% of net sales
in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The Company analyzes
customer creditworthiness, accounts receivable balances, payment history,
payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of
its allowance for doubtful accounts. In instances where a reserve has been
recorded for a particular customer, future sales to the customer are conducted
using either cash-on-delivery terms, or the account is closely monitored so
that as agreed upon payments are received, orders are released; a failure to
pay results in held or cancelled orders.
iFair Value
of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Companys financial
instruments including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The carrying value of notes receivable, long-term debt and capital
lease obligations are based on the instruments interest rate, terms, maturity
date and collateral, if any, in comparison to the Companys incremental
borrowing rate for similar financial instruments.
The
following estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the Company
using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is  43 required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a
current market exchange.

jUse of
Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent
uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future
periods may be based upon amounts that differ from those estimates.
kNotes
Receivable, Trade
The Company issues notes
receivable, trade to certain customers under two basic circumstances; inventory
purchases for initial store openings and overdue accounts receivable. Initial
store opening notes are generally receivable over a period not to exceed twelve
months. The overdue accounts receivable notes may extend for periods greater
than one year. All notes are issued at a market interest rate and contain
certain guarantees and collateral assignments in favor of the Company.
lShare-Based
Compensation
The Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB SFAS No123 revised
2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R,
effective August1, 2005. SFAS 123Rrequires the recognition of the
fair value of share-based compensation in net income. The Company has three
share-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note
3. Share-based compensation consists of stock options and restricted stock
awards. Stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the
fair market value of the Companys stock at the dates of grant. Generally,
stock options and restricted stock granted to employees vest ratably over the
four years from the grant date. The Company recognizes share-based compensation
expense over the requisite service period of the individual grants, which
generally equals the vesting period. Prior to August1, 2005 the Company
accounted for these plans under the intrinsic value method described in
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under
the intrinsic value method, no share-based compensation expense was reflected
in net income for stock option grants. For effects on net income and earnings
per share, if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to share-based compensation see Note 3. 44 mEarnings
Per Share
Basic
earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per share are calculated by adding the dilutive potential common shares to the
weighted average number of common shares that were outstanding during the

stock options are considered common stock equivalents, using the treasury stock
method. A reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding

nComprehensive
Income
Components of other
comprehensive income include net income and certain transactions that have
generally been reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity.
Other comprehensive income is comprised of net income and the net change in fair
value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
oDerivative
Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to
market risks arising from changes in interest rates and fuel costs. The Company
uses derivatives principally in the management of interest rate and fuel
exposure. The Company does not utilize derivatives that contain leverage
features. On the date on which the Company enters into a derivative
transaction, the derivative is designated as a hedge of the identified
exposure. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In this documentation, the
Company specifically identifies the asset, liability, firm commitment,
forecasted transaction, or net investment that has been designated as the
hedged item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to reduce the
risks related to the hedged item. The Company measures effectiveness of its hedging
relationships both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis as needed.
pShipping
and Handling Fees and Costs
The Company includes
shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. Shipping and
handling costs associated with inbound freight are generally recorded in cost
of sales.
qReserves
for Self Insurance
The Company is primarily
self-insured for workers compensation, and general and automobile liability
insurance. It is the Companys policy to record the self-insured portion of workers
compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods to
estimate the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported
but not settled, and that have been incurred but not yet reported. Any
projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability
is subject to a considerable  45 degree
of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external
factors affecting litigation trends, benefit level changes and claim settlement
patterns.
rNew
Accounting Pronouncements
In July2006, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48 FIN 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes detailed guidance
for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of
uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprises financial statements in
accordance with FASB Statement No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption
of FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. FIN 48 will be effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2006 and the provisions of FIN 48 will be
applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of the Interpretation. The
cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this Interpretation will be
reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that
fiscal year. The Company will adopt FIN 48 in fiscal 2007 and is currently
evaluating whether the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
2ACQUISITIONS
On July12, 2005, the Companys wholly owned
subsidiary, Alberts Organics,Inc., acquired substantially all of the
assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Roots Fruits
Cooperative Produce Roots Fruits, a Minnesota-based organic
wholesale distributor of fresh produce and other perishables, for cash
consideration of approximately $103 million. The acquisition was financed by
borrowings against the Companys line of credit. The operating results of Roots
Fruits have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the
Company beginning with the acquisition date. The acquisition resulted in
goodwill of $113million, all of which is expected to be deductible for
tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Companys wholesale segment.
On December20, 2004, the Company acquired by
merger privately held Select Nutrition Distributors,Inc. Select
Nutrition, a national distributor of health beauty aids and
vitamins, minerals supplements headquartered in New York, for cash
consideration and assumed debt of approximately $126 million. The acquisition
was financed by borrowings against the Companys line of credit. The operating
results of Select Nutrition have been included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company beginning with the acquisition date. The acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $68 million, none of which is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. Such goodwill was assigned to the Companys
wholesale segment. 46 3STOCK
OPTION PLANS
Prior to August1, 2005, the Company accounted
for its stock options using the intrinsic value method of accounting provided
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25, and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No123, Accounting
for Share-Based Compensation, SFAS 123. The Company, applying
the intrinsic value method, did not record share-based compensation cost in net
earnings because the exercise price of its stock options equaled the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Accordingly, share-based
compensation was included as a pro forma disclosure in the financial statement
footnotes and continues to be provided for periods prior to August1,
2005.
Effective August1, 2005, the Company adopted the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the
modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method,
compensation cost recognized in fiscal 2006 includes: acompensation
cost for all share-based payments granted through August1, 2005, but for
which the requisite service period had not been completed as of August1,
2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS 123, and bcompensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to August1, 2005, based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
123R. Results for prior periods have not been restated.
The Company recognized share-based compensation
expense of $55 million, or $008 per diluted share, for the year ended July29,
2006, of which $10 million related to the accelerated vesting of certain
options pursuant to the employment transition agreement the Company entered
into during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 with Steven H. Townsend, former
President and Chief Executive Officer. In the year ended July31, 2005,
the Company recognized $02 million of share-based compensation expense,
primarily related to restricted stock awards.
As of July29, 2006, there was $56 million of
total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding share-based
compensation arrangements including stock option and nonvested share awards.
This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 14
years.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
options as operating cash flows in the Condensed Consolidated Cash Flow
statement. SFAS 123Rrequires the cash flows resulting from tax
deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those stock
options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows. 47 The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123
for the years ended July31, 2005 and 2004

For all of the Companys stock-based compensation
plans, the fair value of each grant was estimated at the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Black-Scholes utilizes assumptions
related to volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the dividend yield and
expected life. Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on the
historical volatility of the Companys stock price. The risk-free interest rate
is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The model incorporates exercise and post-vesting forfeiture assumptions based
on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the fiscal 2006 grants
is derived from historical information and other factors.

As of July29, 2006, the Company had two stock
option plans: the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan and the 1996 Stock Option Plan
collectively, the Plans. The Plans provide for grants of stock options to
employees, officers, directors and others. These options are intended to either qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section422 of the
Internal Revenue Code or be non-statutory stock options. Vesting requirements for awards under the
Plans are at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and are
typically four years with graded vesting for employees and two years with
graded vesting for non-employee directors. The maximum term of all incentive
stock options granted under the Plans, and non-statutory stock options granted
under the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, is ten years. The maximum term for
non-statutory stock options granted under the 1996 Stock Option Plan is at the
discretion of the Companys Board of Directors, and all grants to date have had
a term of ten years. There were 7,800,000 shares authorized for grant under the
Plans. As of July29, 2006, 10,600 shares were available for grant under
the 1996 Stock Option Plan and 619,769shares were available for grant
under the  48 2002 Stock Incentive Plan.
The Company has a policy of issuing new shares to satisfy stock option
exercises.

issuance of up to 1,000,000 equity-based compensation awards other than stock
options, such as restricted shares and units, performance shares and units,
bonus shares and stock appreciation rights. Vesting requirements for restricted
share awards under the Plans are at the discretion of the Companys Board of

4TREASURY
STOCK
On December1, 2004,
the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50million
of common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions. As part of the stock repurchase program, the Company purchased
228,800 shares of its common stock for its treasury during the year ended July29,
2006 at an aggregate cost of approximately $61 million. All shares were
purchased at prevailing market prices. 49 5RESTRUCTURING
CHARGE
In the first quarter of
fiscal 2005, the Companys management approved and implemented plans to
restructure the broadline distribution operations at its Mounds View, Minnesota
distribution facility, because the facility was not large enough to accommodate
the needs of customers relative to product selection and availability. The $02
million restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was associated
primarily with severance costs related to the termination of approximately 85
employees at this facility. This restructuring was completed in the third
quarter of fiscal 2005. The accruals related to the restructuring were utilized
by the end of fiscal 2005.
6ASSET HELD
FOR SALE
In November2005, the
Company transitioned all remaining operations at one of its Auburn, California
facilities to its new Rocklin, California facility. As a result, the Company
has reclassified $69million of long-lived assets, net of a $05 million
loss recorded on the sale of certain warehouse equipment, related to its Auburn
facility that were previously included in property and equipment as held for
sale which is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the
consolidated balance sheet.
7NOTES
PAYABLE
On April30, 2004, the Company entered into an
amended and restated four-year $250 million secured revolving credit facility
with a bank group that was led by Bank of America Business Capital formerly
Fleet Capital Corporation as the administrative agent the amended credit
facility. The amended credit facility increased the amount available for
borrowing from $150 million to $250 million, on which interest accrues, at the
Companys option, at the New York Prime Rate 825% at July29, 2006 and
625% at July31, 2005 or at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR
plus 125%. The $250 million credit facility matures on March31, 2008. The
Company amended this facility effective in January2006, reducing the rate
at which interest accrues on LIBOR borrowing to LIBOR plus 075%. The weighted
average interest rate on the amended credit facility was 619% as of July29,
2006. As of July29, 2006, the Companys outstanding borrowings under the
amended credit facility totaled $1250 million with an availability of $1139
million. As more fully discussed in Note 7, the Company entered into certain
interest rate swap agreements to hedge this indebtedness which were assigned
and transferred to a third party in December2003.
The amended credit
facility contains certain restrictive covenants. The Company was in compliance
with all restrictive covenants at July29, 2006. The amended credit
facility also provides for the bank to syndicate the credit facility to other
banks and lending institutions. The Company has pledged the majority of its
accounts receivable and inventory for its obligations under the amended credit
facility.
8LONG-TERM
DEBT
The Company entered into a $30 million term loan
agreement with a financial institution effective April30, 2003. The term
loan was repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization
schedule. Interest accrued at 30 day LIBOR plus 150%. The Company has pledged
certain real property as collateral for its obligations under the term loan
agreement. In July2005, the Company amended the term loan agreement with
the financial institution, increasing the principal amount available up to $75million,
decreasing the interest rate to LIBOR plus 10%, and extending the maturity
date to July2012. 50 As of July29,

INSTRUMENTS
The Companys interest
rate swap and commodity swap agreements at July29, 2006 are designated as
cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in its consolidated balance
sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in
stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income. However, to
the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly
effective in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged, any
changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts
are immediately recognized in income. At July29, 2006, the Company did
not have any ineffectiveness in its derivatives requiring current income
recognition.
Interest Rate Swap
Agreements
Interest rate swap agreements are entered into for
periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute
positions independent of those exposures. At July29, 2006, the Company
had one outstanding interest rate swap agreement with a fair value of $12
million. The agreement provides for the Company to pay interest for a
seven-year period at a fixed rate of 470% on a notional principal amount of
$50 million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on
the same notional principal amount. The swap has been entered into as a hedge
against LIBOR interest rate movements on  51 current variable rate
indebtedness totaling $65 million at LIBOR plus 100%, thereby fixing its effective
rate on the notional amount at 570%. The swap agreement qualified as an effective
hedge under SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. LIBOR was 540% and
352% as of July29, 2006 and July31, 2005, respectively.
In May2003, the Company entered into an interest
rate swap agreement. The agreement provided for the Company to pay interest for
a seven-year period at a fixed rate of 368% on a notional principal amount of
$30 million while receiving interest for the same period at the LIBOR rate on
the same notional principal amount. The swap had been entered into as a hedge
against LIBOR interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness
totaling $30 million at LIBOR plus 150%, thereby fixing the effective rate on
the notional amount at 518%. The swap agreement qualified as an effective
hedge under SFAS 133. On July29, 2005, this agreement was terminated and
income of $06 million was recorded in other expense income in the Companys
statement of income for the year ended July31, 2005.
In October1998 and August2001,
the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements which were later
determined to be ineffective. This was due to the inclusion of an option for
the counterparty to extend the term of the agreements, which prohibited
accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under SFAS 133. On December29,
2003, the Company assigned and transferred all of its obligations of its two ineffective
interest rate swaps to a third party at a cost of $54 million plus accrued
interest which was recorded in other expense income in the Companys
consolidated statement of income for the year ended July31, 2004.
Commodity Swap
Agreements
The
Company has entered into commodity swap agreements to reduce price risk
associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel. The outstanding commodity
swap agreements hedge a portion of the Companys expected fuel usage for the
periods set forth in the agreements. The agreements call for an exchange of
payments with the Company making payments based on fixed price per gallon and
receiving payments based on floating prices, without an exchange of the
underlying commodity amount upon which the payments are based. The Company
monitors the commodity NYMEX #2 Heating oil used in its swap agreements to
determine that the correlation between the commodity and diesel fuel is deemed
to be highly effective. At July29, 2006, the Company had two
outstanding commodity swap agreements which commenced and expire on
November1, 2005 and October31, 2006 and July1, 2006 and
June30, 2007, respectively. The fair market value of the commodity swaps
totaled $05 million as of July29, 2006.
10COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company leases various facilities and equipment
under operating lease agreements with varying terms. Most of the leases contain
renewal options and purchase options at several specific dates throughout the
terms of the leases.
Rent and other lease expense for the years ended July29,
2006, July31, 2005 and July31, 2004 totaled approximately $140
million, $149 million, and $168 million, respectively. 52 Future
minimum annual fixed payments required under non-cancelable operating leases
having an original term of more than one year as of July29, 2006 are as

The Company may from time
to time be involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of
these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
11 RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company has one
defined contribution retirement plan, the United Natural Foods,Inc.
Retirement Plan the Plan. During fiscal 2006, the Company merged the
defined contribution plans of Select Nutrition and Roots Fruits into
the Plan. Under the Plan, employees may elect to contribute a percentage of
their pay to the Plan on a before-tax basis. In order to become a participant
in the Plan, employees must meet certain eligibility requirements as described
in the Plans document. In addition to amounts contributed to the Plan by
employees, the Company makes contributions to the Plan on behalf of the
employees. The Company contributions to the Plan were approximately $21
million, $20million, and $19 million for the years ended July29,
2006, July31, 2005 and July31, 2004, respectively.
12 EMPLOYEE STOCK
OWNERSHIP PLAN
The Company adopted the UNFI Employee Stock Ownership
Plan the ESOP Plan for the purpose of acquiring outstanding shares of the
Company for the benefit of eligible employees. The ESOP Plan was effective as
of November1, 1988 and has received notice of qualification by the
Internal Revenue Service.
In connection with the adoption of the ESOP Plan, a
Trust was established to hold the shares acquired. On November1, 1988,
the Trust purchased 40% of the then outstanding Common Stock of the Company at
a price of $41 million. The trustees funded this purchase by issuing
promissory notes to the initial stockholders, with the Trust shares pledged as
collateral. These notes bear interest at 10% and are payable through May2015.
As the debt is repaid, shares are released from collateral and allocated to
active employees, based on the proportion of debt service paid in the year.
The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued Statement of Position
93-6, Employers Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans, SOP 93-6, in November1993. The statement
provides guidance on employers accounting for ESOPs and is required to be
applied to shares purchased by ESOPs after December31, 1992, that have
not been committed to be released as of the beginning of the year of adoption.
As allowed under SOP 93-6, the Company elected not to adopt the guidance
in SOP 93-6 for the shares held by the ESOP, all of which were  53 purchased prior to December31,
1992. As a result, the Company continues to follow the guidance of SOP 76-3,
Accounting Practices for Certain Employee Stock
Ownership Plans SOP 76-3. Under SOP 76-3, unreleased
shares of the ESOP are considered to be outstanding for purposes of calculating
both basic and diluted earnings per share, whether or not the shares have been
committed to be released. The debt of the ESOP is recorded as debt and the
shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the
consolidated balance sheets. During the fiscal years ended July29, 2006, July31,
2005 and July31, 2004, contributions totaling approximately $04 million 03 million and $03 million, respectively, were made to the Trust. Of these
contributions, approximately $02 million represented interest in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004.

At July29, 2006, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $45 million for federal income tax
purposes. The federal carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of $249thousand
under Internal Revenue Code Section382. The carryforwards expire at
various times between 2020 and 2024. In addition, the company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $288 million for state income tax purposes
that expire in years 2007 through 2025.
In assessing the
recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Due to the fact that the Company has sufficient taxable income in the
federal carryback period and anticipates sufficient future taxable income over
the periods which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets for federal and state tax purposes, with the
exception of certain state operating loss carryforwards, appears more likely
than not at July29, 2006.
14 BUSINESS
SEGMENTS

Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eof
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K the Evaluation

and procedures are effective in timely reporting material information required
to be included in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
b Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules13a-15for
15d-15fpromulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by,
or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of July29, 2006. In making
this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, our management concluded
that, as of July29, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting
was effective based on those criteria at the reasonable assurance level.
Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of July29, 2006 has been
audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in its report which is included in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form10-K. 59 c Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting firm.
Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
United Natural Foods,Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Report of Management regarding Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that United Natural Foods,Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of July29, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
United Natural Foods,Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that United
Natural Foods,Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July29, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, United Natural Foods,Inc. and
subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of July29, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the consolidated balance sheets of United Natural Foods,Inc.
and subsidiaries as of July29, 2006 and July31, 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity  60 and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended July29, 2006,
and our report dated October6, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
those consolidated financial statements. Providence, Rhode Island
