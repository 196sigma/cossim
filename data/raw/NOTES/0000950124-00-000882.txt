30 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT
To the Boards of Directors and Shareholders of
DTE Energy Company and
The Detroit Edison Company
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of DTE Energy Company and
subsidiaries and of The Detroit Edison Company and subsidiaries together, the
Companies as of December31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 1999. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item8. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Companies management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DTE Energy
Company and subsidiaries and of The Detroit Edison Company and subsidiaries at
December31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 1999 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements of the Companies taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Corporate Structure and Principles of Consolidation
DTE Energy Company Company, a Michigan corporation incorporated in 1995, is
an exempt holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The
Company has no significant operations of its own, holding instead the stock of
its principal operating subsidiary, The Detroit Edison Company Detroit
Edison, an electric public utility regulated by the Michigan Public Service
Commission MPSCand the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC, and
other energy-related businesses.
All majority owned subsidiaries are consolidated. Non-majority owned
investments, including investments in limited liability companies, partnerships
and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.
In October1999, the Companys investee, Plug Power Inc., completed its initial
public offering IPOof shares of common stock at $15 per share. After the
IPO, the Company owned approximately 32% of Plug Powers outstanding common
stock. As a result of Plug Powers IPO, the Company recognized its
proportionate share of Plug Powers net assets immediately after the IPO and
recorded an increase of $44million in its investment and an after-tax increase
of $28million to retained earnings with no earnings impact in 1999.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Regulation and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
Detroit Edisons transmission and distribution business meets the criteria of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo71, Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. This accounting standard recognizes
the cost based ratemaking process which results in differences in the
application of generally accepted accounting principles between regulated and
non-regulated businesses. SFAS No71 requires the recording of regulatory
assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as
revenue and expense in non-regulated businesses. Detroit Edisons regulatory
assets and liabilities are being amortized to revenue and expense as they are
included in rates. Continued applicability of SFAS No71 requires that rates
be designed to recover specific costs of providing regulated services and
products, and that it be reasonable to
43 assume that rates are set at levels that
will recover a utilitys costs and can be charged to and collected from
customers.
MPSC Orders issued in 1997 and 1998 altered the regulatory process in Michigan
and provided a plan for transition to competition for the generation business
of Detroit Edison. Therefore, effective December31, 1998, Detroit Edisons
generation business no longer met the criteria of SFAS No71. Detroit Edison
did not write off any regulatory assets as a result of the discontinuation of
SFAS No71 for its generation business, since accounting guidance issued by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board and its Emerging Issues Task Force
permits the recording of regulatory assets which are expected to be recovered
through regulated rates. A December1998 MPSC Order authorized the recovery of
an additional regulatory asset equal to the net book value of Fermi 2 at
December31, 1998, which includes recoverable income taxes, deferred tax
credits and deferred amortization. See the following table of regulatory
assets and liabilities, and Note 3 for further details.

Unamoritized nuclear costs See Note 3. 44 Unamortized loss on reacquired debt
In accordance with MPSC regulations applicable to Detroit Edison, the discount,
premium and expense related to debt redeemed with a refinancing are amortized
over the life of the replacement issue, or if related to the generation
business, beginning in 2002 they will be amortized through 2007. See Note 3.
Discount, premium and expense on early redemptions of debt subsequent to
December31, 1998 are charged to earnings if they relate to the generation
business of Detroit Edison.
Recoverable income taxes
In 1993, the Company was required to adopt SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFAS No109 requires that deferred income taxes be recorded at the
current income tax rate for all temporary differences between the book and tax
basis of assets and liabilities. Prior to 1993, only those deferred taxes that
were authorized by the MPSC were recorded. Upon adoption of SFAS No109, the
MPSC authorized the Company to record a regulatory asset providing assurance of
future revenue recovery from customers for all deferred income taxes.
Power supply cost recovery PSCR
State legislation provides Detroit Edison a mechanism for recovery of changes
in power supply costs for purchased power and generation based on a
reconciliation of actual costs and usage which is subject to MPSC approval.
1997 storm damage costs
The costs of major storms in 1997 were deferred, as authorized by the MPSC, and
were amortized into expense in 1998 and 1999 as they were recovered through
rates.
Electric Choice implementation costs
Costs incurred to implement the Electric Choice Program are being deferred,
with amortization planned to begin coincident with full implementation of the
program.
Unamortized deferred investment tax credits
Investment tax credits utilized, which relate to utility property, were
deferred and are amortized over the estimated composite service life of the
related property.
Fermi 2 capacity factor performance standard
The MPSC has established a mechanism which provides for the disallowance of net
incremental replacement power cost if Fermi 2 does not perform to certain
operating criteria. A disallowance is imposed for the amount by which the
Fermi 2 three-year rolling average capacity factor is less than the greater of
either the average of the top 50% of U.S. boiling water reactors or 50%. An
estimate of the incremental cost of replacement
45 power is required in computing
the reserve for amounts due customers under this performance standard.
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company considers
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Cash maintained for debt service requirements and other contractual obligations
is classified as restricted cash.
Revenues
Detroit Edison records unbilled revenues for electric and steam heating

Utility properties are stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances
and impairment losses. In general, the cost of properties retired in the
normal course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation. Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and the cost of
new property installed, which replaces property retired, is charged to property
accounts. Detroit Edison recognizes a provision for incremental costs of Fermi
2 refueling outages, including maintenance activities, anticipated to be
incurred during the next scheduled Fermi 2 refueling outage. The annual
provision for utility property depreciation is calculated on the straight-line
remaining life method by applying annual rates approved by the MPSC to the
average of year-beginning and year-ending balances of depreciable property by
primary plant accounts. Provision for depreciation of utility plant, as a
percent of average depreciable property, was 333%, 332% and 329% for 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
Non-utility property is stated at original cost. Depreciation is computed over
the estimated useful lives using straight-line and declining-balance methods.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed based on market
factors and operational considerations for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable.
Software Costs
The Company capitalizes the cost of software developed for internal use. These
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period beginning
with the projects completion.
Debt Issue Costs
The costs related to the issuance of long-term debt are amortized over the life
of each issue.
47 Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value
method. Compensation expense is not recorded for stock options granted with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. For grants
of restricted stock, compensation equal to the market value of the shares at
the date of grant is deferred and amortized to expense over the vesting period.
Accounting for Risk Management Activities
Trading activities of DTE Energy Trading, Inc. DTE ET, an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, are accounted for using the mark-to-market
method of accounting. Under such method, DTE ETs energy trading contracts,
including both transactions for physical delivery and financial instruments,
are recorded at market value. The resulting unrealized gains and losses from
changes in market value of open positions are recorded as other current assets
or liabilities. Current period changes in the trading assets or liabilities
are recognized as net gains or losses in operating revenues. The market prices
used to value these transactions reflect managements best estimate considering
various factors, including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations,
time value and volatility factors underlying the commitments. Realized gains
and losses from transactions settled with cash are also recognized in operating
revenues. Transactions settled by physical delivery of power are recorded
gross in operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expense.
Detroit Edison continues to account for its forward purchase and sale
commitments and over-the-counter options on a settlement basis.
New Accounting Standard
In June1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement
requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and
liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of
the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. In June1999,
SFAS No137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No133 was issued. SFAS No.
137 amends the effective date of SFAS No133 to fiscal years beginning after
June15, 2000, with earlier adoption encouraged. The Company will adopt this
accounting standard as required by January1, 2001, but has not yet determined
the impact of this new pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the 1999
presentation.
48 NOTE 2 MERGER AGREEMENT On October4, 1999, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement with
MCN Energy Group Inc. MCN. MCN, a Michigan corporation, is primarily
involved in natural gas production, gathering, processing, transmission,
storage and distribution, electric power generation and energy marketing.
MCNs largest subsidiary is Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, a natural gas
utility serving 12million customers in more than 500 communities throughout
Michigan. Shareholders of the Company have approved the issuance of the
necessary shares of common stock to complete the merger and shareholders of MCN
have approved the Agreement and Plan of Merger. The merger, which is also
subject to a number of regulatory approvals and other agreed upon conditions,
is expected to be completed in the first half of 2000. The merger agreement
provides that the Company will acquire all outstanding shares of MCN for $2850
per share in cash or 0775 shares of Company common stock for each share of
MCN common stock, subject to certain allocation procedures requiring that the
aggregate number of shares of MCN common stock that will be converted into cash
and the Companys common stock will be equal to 55% and 45%, respectively, of
the total number of shares of MCN common stock outstanding immediately prior to
the merger. The transaction was preliminarily valued at $46billion, which
includes the assumption of approximately $2billion of MCNs debt. The Company
expects to continue as an exempt public utility holding company after the
completion of the merger.
NOTE 3 REGULATORY MATTERS Detroit Edison is subject to the primary regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC,
which, from time to time, issues its Orders pertaining to Detroit Edisons
conditions of service, rates and recovery of certain costs including the costs
of generating facilities. MPSC Orders issued December1988, January1994,
November1997, December1998 and March1999, are currently in effect with
respect to Detroit Edisons rates and certain other revenue, accounting and
operating-related matters.
Electric Industry Restructuring
There are ongoing proceedings for the restructuring of the Michigan electric
public utility industry and the implementation of Electric Choice. During the
period from 1997 through 1999, the MPSC issued several Orders relating to
Electric Choice and competition.
In a December28, 1998 Order, as clarified March8, 1999, the MPSC authorized
the accelerated amortization of the remaining net book balances as of December
31, 1998 of Fermi 2 and its associated regulatory assets in a manner that will
provide an opportunity for full recovery under current rates from bundled
customers and through transition surcharges from future retail access
customers, taking into account the related tax consequences of those assets, by
December31, 2007.
The December28, 1998 Order, as clarified March8, 1999, imposed conditions for
the recovery by Detroit Edison of accelerated amortization of Fermi 2 and on
March8 49 1999, the MPSC issued Orders clarifying several issues related to
Electric Choice. As a result of the Order, as clarified, Detroit Edison     
Reduced its base rates by approximately $94million annually ,
effective January1, 1999 and effective January1, 2000, by an
additional $15million to reflect the expiration of the two-year
extraordinary storm damage surcharge         
Indicated it will reduce its jurisdictional retail rates by removing
the Fermi 2 regulatory asset, referred to in Note 1 as unamortized
nuclear costs, from rate base on a pro rata jurisdictional rate
basis when such asset reaches zero, which is currently anticipated
to occur January1, 2008         
Indicated that while it has no plans to sell Fermi 2, should such a
sale occur, it will return to customers the difference between Fermi
2s net book value currently recorded as a regulatory asset at the
time of sale and the actual sale price; and the MPSC will be advised
of a purchase of Detroit Edison during the accelerated amortization
period so that the MPSC may determine whether the proposed
transaction is in the public interest and properly balances the
interests of investors and customers         
Agreed that should Detroit Edison seek to abandon Fermi 2 which
Detroit Edison has no plans to do during the accelerated
amortization period, and only if electric generation has not been
deregulated by either Michigan state or federal action, Detroit
Edison will initiate a contested case proceeding before the MPSC
seeking approval of the abandonment         
Indicated that if its earned rate of return exceeds its authorized
rate of return during the period of time that amortization of Fermi
2 is being accelerated, it will apply 50% of the excess earnings to
reduce its stranded investment in Fermi 2         
Indicated it will implement a 90 megawatt MWElectric Choice pilot
program and will also begin the phase-in of full Electric Choice
commencing in 1999, with full Electric Choice effective January1,
2002; and         
Indicated it will use its best efforts to provide standby service
to Electric Choice customers. Best efforts means that Detroit
Edison must make the service available to Electric Choice customers
who request it, but Detroit Edison does not have to build or
purchase new capacity or interrupt firm customers to provide the
service. Standby service is to be priced at Detroit Edisons top
incremental cost plus 1 cent. Several parties have filed petitions for rehearing or clarification; the MPSC
has not ruled on these petitions. The Association of Businesses Advocating
Tariff Equity in Michigan ABATEhas also filed an appeal with the Michigan
Court of Appeals. Detroit Edison is unable to determine the timing or outcome
of these proceedings.
Accounting Implications
Detroit Edison accounts for its transmission and distribution business in
accordance with SFAS No71. Continued application of SFAS No71 by Detroit
Edison requires: 1 third party regulation of rates, 2 cost-based rates, and
3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers
through rates.
Due to the restructuring orders which provided sufficient details regarding the
transition to competition for its electric generation business, effective
December31, 1998, Detroit
50 Edison adopted the provisions of SFAS No101,
Regulated Enterprises-Accounting for the Discontinuation of Application of
FASB Statement No71, for its electric generation business. SFAS No101
requires an evaluation to be performed to determine whether or not indications
of impairment exist for plant assets under SFAS No121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,
and the elimination of certain effects of rate regulation that have been
recognized as assets or liabilities pursuant to SFAS No71.
At December31, 1998, Detroit Edison performed an impairment test of its Fermi
2 nuclear generation plant and related regulatory assets pursuant to SFAS No.
121. The impairment test for Fermi 2 indicated that it was fully impaired.
Therefore, the Fermi 2 plant asset and its related regulatory assets were
written off. At December31, 1998, the accumulation of future regulatory
recovery for Fermi 2 assets from bundled customers and transition surcharges
from future retail access customers was calculated. Since the December28,
1998 MPSC Order provides for full recovery of Fermi 2 through the regulated
transmission and distribution business, a regulatory asset was established
which will be amortized through December31, 2007. There was no impact on
income from the write off of the Fermi 2 plant assets and subsequent recording
of the regulatory asset for unamortized nuclear costs.
1988 Settlement Agreement
The December1988 MPSC Order established for the period January1989 through
December2003: 1 a cap on Fermi 2 capital additions of $25million per year,
in 1988 dollars adjusted by the Consumers Price Index CPI, cumulative, 2 a
cap on Fermi 2 non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses adjusted by the CPI,
and 3 a capacity factor performance standard based on a three-year rolling
average commencing in 1991. For a capital investment of $200million or more
in 1988 dollars adjusted by the CPI, Detroit Edison must obtain prior MPSC
approval to include the investment in rate base. Under the cap on Fermi 2
capital expenditures, the cumulative amount available totals $76million in
1999 dollars at December31, 1999. In a 1999 filing on the true-up of
stranded costs, Detroit Edison requested continued recovery of Fermi 2 capital
additions through 2007, which is the end of the transition period for stranded
cost recovery as ordered by the MPSC. The 1999 Fermi 2 capital additions of
$27million are recorded as a regulatory asset. Under the cap on Fermi 2
non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses, the cumulative amount available
totals $143million in 1999 dollars at December31, 1999.
Under the December1988 Order, if nuclear operations at Fermi 2 permanently
cease, amortization in rates of a $513million investment in Fermi 2 would
continue and the remaining net rate base investment amount would be removed
from rate base and amortized in rates, without return, over 10years with such
amortization not to exceed $290million per year. The December1988 and
January1994 Orders do not address the costs of decommissioning if the
operations at Fermi 2 prematurely cease.
In accordance with a November1997 MPSC Order, Detroit Edison reduced revenues
by $53million to reflect the scheduled reduction in the revenue requirement
for Fermi 2, in accordance with the 1988 settlement agreement. The $53million
decrease is
51 included in the $94million decrease effective January1, 1999. In
addition, the November1997 MPSC Order authorized the deferral of $30million
of 1997 storm damage costs and amortization and recovery of the costs over a
24-month period commencing January1998. In December1997, ABATE and the
Residential Ratepayer Consortium filed a lawsuit in Ingham County Circuit Court
contending that Detroit Edison and the MPSC breached the December1988 MPSC
Order but the lawsuit was subsequently dismissed. The Michigan Attorney General
has filed an appeal of the November1997 Order in the Michigan Court of
Appeals. In June1999, in an unpublished opinion, the Michigan Court of
Appeals remanded back to the MPSC for hearing the November1997 Order. Detroit
Edison filed a motion for rehearing with the Michigan Court of Appeals in July
1999, but the motion was subsequently dismissed. Detroit Edison is unable to
determine the timing or the outcome of the remand.
NOTE 4 FERMI 2 General
Fermi 2, a nuclear generating unit, began commercial operation in January1988.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRCmaintains jurisdiction over the
licensing and operation of Fermi 2. Fermi 2 has a design electrical rating
netof 1,150 MW. This unit represents approximately 11% of total operation
and maintenance expenses and 10% of summer net rated capability. The net book
balance of the Fermi 2 plant was written off at December31, 1998 and an
equivalent regulatory asset was established.
Ownership of an operating nuclear generating unit subjects Detroit Edison to
significant additional risks. Fermi 2 is regulated by a number of different
governmental agencies concerned with public health, safety and environmental
protection. Consequently, Fermi 2 is subjected to greater scrutiny than a
conventional fossil-fueled plant. See Note 3.
Insurance
Detroit Edison insures Fermi 2 with property damage insurance provided by
Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited NEIL. The NEIL insurance policies provide
$500million of composite primary coverage with a $1million deductible and
$225billion of excess coverage, respectively, for stabilization,
decontamination and debris removal costs, repair and/or replacement of property
and decommissioning. Accordingly, the combined limits provide total property
damage insurance of $275billion.
Detroit Edison maintains insurance policies with NEIL providing for extra
expenses, including certain replacement power costs necessitated by Fermi 2s
unavailability due to an insured event. These policies have a 12-week waiting
period and provide for three years of coverage.
Under the NEIL policies, Detroit Edison could be liable for maximum
retrospective assessments of up to approximately $20million per loss if any
one loss should exceed the accumulated funds available to NEIL.
52 As required by federal law, Detroit Edison maintains $200million of public
liability insurance for a nuclear incident. Further, under the Price-Anderson
Amendments Act of 1988, deferred premium charges of $84million could be levied
against each licensed nuclear facility, but not more than $10million per year
per facility. On December31, 1999, there were 106 licensed nuclear facilities
in the United States. Thus, deferred premium charges in the aggregate amount
of approximately $889billion could be levied against all owners of licensed
nuclear facilities in the event of a nuclear incident at any of these
facilities.
Decommissioning
The NRC has jurisdiction over the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and
requires decommissioning funding based upon a formula. The MPSC and FERC
regulate the recovery of costs of decommissioning nuclear power plants and both
require the use of external trust funds to finance the decommissioning of Fermi
2. Base rates approved by the MPSC provide for the decommissioning costs of
Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is continuing to fund FERC jurisdictional amounts for
decommissioning even though explicit provisions are not included in FERC rates.
Detroit Edison believes that the MPSC and FERC collections will be adequate to
fund the estimated cost of decommissioning using the NRC formula.
Detroit Edison has established external trust funds to hold decommissioning and
low-level radioactive waste disposal funds collected from customers. During
1999, 1998 and 1997 Detroit Edison collected $38million, $36million and $36
million, respectively, from customers for decommissioning and low-level
radioactive waste disposal. Such amounts were recorded as components of
depreciation and amortization expense and in other liabilities. Net unrealized
gains of $4million and $37million in 1999 and 1998, respectively, were
recorded as increases to the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and other
liabilities. Investments in debt and equity securities held within the
external trust funds are classified as available for sale.
At December31, 1999, Detroit Edison had a reserve of $314million for the
future decommissioning of Fermi 2, $12million for low-level radioactive waste
disposal costs, and $35million for the future decommissioning of Fermi 1, an
experimental nuclear unit on the Fermi 2 site that has been shut down since
1972. These reserves are included in other liabilities, with a like amount
deposited in external trust funds. It is estimated that the cost of
decommissioning Fermi 2 when its license expires in the year 2025 will be $688
million in 1999 dollars and $3billion in 2025 dollars using a 6% inflation
rate, and the cost of decommissioning Fermi 1 in 2025 is $34million in 1999
dollars and $161million in 2025 dollars using a 6% inflation rate.
Fermi 2 Phase-In Plan
SFAS No92, Regulated Enterprises Accounting for Phase-in Plans, permits
the capitalization of costs deferred for future recovery under a phase-in plan.
Based on a MPSC-authorized phase-in plan, Detroit Edison recorded a receivable
totaling $5065million from 1988 through 1992. Beginning in 1993 and ending
in 1998, these amounts
53 were amortized to operating expense as they were
included in rates. Amortization of these amounts totaled $84million and $112
million in 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Capacity Factor Performance Standard
The capacity factor disallowances for 1998 and 1999 have not yet been
determined by the MPSC. At December31, 1999 and 1998, Detroit Edison had
accruals of $63million and $86million, respectively, for the Fermi 2 capacity
factor performance standard disallowances that are expected to be imposed by
the MPSC for 1998 and 1999, and for the estimated impact on the 2000 capacity
factor disallowance resulting from Fermi 2s lower than expected capacity
utilization in 1998.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs
In accordance with the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, Detroit Edison
has a contract with the United States Department of Energy DOEfor the future
storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel from Fermi 2. Detroit Edison is
obligated to pay DOE a fee of one mill per net kilowatthour of Fermi 2
electricity generated and sold. The fee is a component of nuclear fuel
expense. Delays have occurred in the DOEs program for the acceptance and
disposal of spent nuclear fuel at a permanent repository. Until the DOE is
able to fulfill its obligation under the contract, Detroit Edison is
responsible for the spent nuclear fuel storage and estimates that existing
storage capacity will be sufficient until 2001, or until 2015 with expansion of
such storage capacity. Plans are currently under way to complete the expansion
project by 2001.

NOTE 7 SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY At December31, 1999, the Company had 5million shares of Cumulative Preferred
Stock, without par value, authorized with no shares issued. At December31,
1999, 15million shares of preferred stock are reserved for issuance in
accordance with the
Shareholders Rights Agreement.
At December31, 1999, Detroit Edison had 30million shares of Cumulative
Preference Stock of $1 par value and 675million shares of Cumulative
Preferred Stock of $100 par value authorized, with no shares issued. All of
Detroit Edisons 775% Series and 774% SeriesCumulative Preferred Stock were
redeemed in 1998.
In September1997, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
distribution of one right Right for each share of Company common stock
outstanding. Under certain circumstances, each Right entitles the shareholder
to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Company SeriesA Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at a price of $90. If the acquiring person or
group acquires 10% or more of the Company common stock, and the Company
survives, each Right other than those held by the acquirer will entitle its
holder to buy Company common stock having a value of $180 for $90. If the
acquiring person or group acquires 10% or more of the Company common stock, and
the Company does not survive, each Right other than those held by the
surviving or acquiring company will entitle its holder to buy shares of common
stock of the surviving or acquiring company having a value of $180 for $90.
The Rights will expire on October6, 2007, unless redeemed by the Company at
$001 per Right at any time prior to an event which would permit the Rights to
be exercised. The Company may amend the
56 Rights agreement without the approval
of the holders of the Rights Certificates, except that the redemption price may
not be less than $001 per Right.

covers substantially all of Detroit Edisons properties, provides for the
issuance of additional General and Refunding Mortgage Bonds Mortgage Bonds.
At December31, 1999, approximately $41billion principal amount of Mortgage
Bonds could have been issued on the basis of property additions, combined with
an earnings test provision, assuming an interest rate of 8% on any such
additional Mortgage Bonds. An additional $19billion principal amount of
Mortgage Bonds could have been issued on the basis of bond retirements.
57 Unless an event of default has occurred, and is continuing, each series of
Quarterly Income Debt Securities QUIDSprovides that interest will be paid
quarterly. However, Detroit Edison also has the right to extend the interest
payment period on the QUIDS for up to 20 consecutive interest payment periods.
Interest would continue to accrue during the deferral period. If this right
is exercised, Detroit Edison may not declare or pay dividends on, or redeem,
purchase or acquire, any of its capital stock during the deferral period.
Detroit Edison may redeem any series of capital stock pursuant to the terms of
any sinking fund provisions during the deferral period. Additionally, during
any deferral period, Detroit Edison may not enter into any inter-company
transactions with any affiliate of Detroit Edison, including the Company, to
enable the payment of dividends on any equity securities of the Company.
At December31, 1999, $273million of notes and bonds were subject to periodic
remarketings within one year. Remarketing agents remarket these securities at
the lowest interest rate necessary to produce a par bid. In the event that a
remarketing fails, Standby Note Purchase Agreements and/or Letters of Credit
provide that banks will purchase the securities and, after the conclusion of
all necessary proceedings, remarket the bonds. In the event the banks
obligations under the Standby Note Purchase Agreements and/or Letters of
Credit are not honored, then Detroit Edison would be required to purchase any
securities subject to a failed remarketing.
NOTE 9 SHORT-TERM CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND BORROWINGS At December31, 1999, Detroit Edison had total short-term credit arrangements
of approximately $524million, under which $162million was outstanding. At
December31, 1998, $231million was outstanding. The weighted average interest
rates for short-term borrowings at December31, 1999 and 1998 were 69% and
62%, respectively.
Detroit Edison had bank lines of credit of $201million, all of which had
commitment fees in lieu of compensating balances. Detroit Edison uses bank
lines of credit and other credit facilities to support the issuance of
commercial paper and bank loans. Detroit Edison had $162million and $231
million of commercial paper outstanding at December31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.
Detroit Edison had a nuclear fuel financing arrangement with Renaissance Energy
Company Renaissance, an unaffiliated company. Renaissance may issue
commercial paper or borrow from participating banks on the basis of promissory
notes. To the extent the maximum amount of funds available to Renaissance
currently $400million is not needed by Renaissance to purchase nuclear fuel,
such funds may be loaned to Detroit Edison for general corporate purposes
pursuant to a separate Loan Agreement. At December31, 1999, approximately
$323million was available to Detroit Edison under such Loan Agreement.
Detroit Edison had a $200million short-term financing agreement secured by its
customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues portfolio under which $200
million was outstanding at December31, 1999 at a weighted average interest
rate of 61%. At December31, 1998, there were no amounts outstanding.
58 At December31, 1999, DTE Capital Corporation DTE Capital, a Company
subsidiary, had short-term credit arrangements of $400million backed by a

NOTE 11 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Trading Activities
DTE ET markets and trades electricity and natural gas physical products and
financial instruments, and provides risk management services utilizing energy
commodity derivative instruments which include futures, exchange traded and
over-the-counter options, and forward purchase and sale commitments. The
notional amounts and 59 terms of DTE ETs outstanding
energy trading financial instruments and the fair values of DTE ETs energy
commodity derivative instruments were not material at December31, 1999.
Market Risk
DTE ET manages, on a portfolio basis, the market risks inherent in its
activities subject to parameters established by the Companys Risk Management
Committee RMC, which is authorized by its Board of Directors. Market risks
are monitored by the RMC to ensure compliance with the Companys stated risk
management policies. DTE ET marks its portfolio to market and measures its
risk on a daily basis in accordance with Value at Risk VaR and other risk
methodologies. The quantification of market risk using VaR provides a
consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products.
Credit Risk
DTE ET is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by customers or
counterparties of its contractual obligations. The concentration of customers
and/or counterparties may impact overall exposure to credit risk, either
positively or negatively, in that the counterparties may be similarly affected
by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions. However, DTE ET
maintains credit policies with regard to its customers and counterparties that
management believes significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies
include an evaluation of potential customers and counterparties financial
condition and credit rating, collateral requirements or other credit
enhancements such as letters of credit or guarantees, and the use of
standardized agreements which allow for the netting or offsetting of positive
and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Based on these
policies, the Company does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on
financial position or results of operations as a result of customer or
counterparty nonperformance. Those futures and option contracts which are
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange are financially guaranteed by the
Exchange and have nominal credit risk.
Non-Trading Activities
Interest Rate Swaps
In October1996, Detroit Edison entered into a three-year interest rate swap
agreement based on a notional amount of $25million, which was nominally linked
to the Detroit Edison 1993 SeriesB Remarketed Notes. In 1999 and 1998, the
average rate received was 512% and 568%, respectively, and the average rate
paid was 471% and 502%, respectively. The net of interest received and
interest paid on the swap was accrued as a component of interest expense in the
current period.
PCI Enterprises Company PCI, a coal pulverizing subsidiary, entered into a
seven-year interest rate swap agreement beginning June30, 1997, with the
intent of reducing the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate
non-recourse debt. The initial notional amount was $30million which was based
on 60% of its term loan of $50million.
60 The notional amount outstanding at December31, 1999 and 1998, was $24million
and $27million, respectively, and will decline throughout the term of the loan
based on amortization of principal amounts. PCI pays a fixed interest rate of
696% on the notional amount and receives a variable interest rate based on
LIBOR. In 1999 and 1998, the average rate received was 528% and 565 respectively. The net of interest received and interest paid on the swap is
accrued as a component of interest expense in the current period.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments is determined by reference to various
market data and other valuation techniques as appropriate. The carrying amount
of financial instruments, except for long-term debt, approximates fair value.
The estimated fair value of total long-term debt at December31, 1999 and 1998
was $4billion and $48billion, respectively, compared to the carrying amount
of $42billion and $45billion, respectively.
NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments
Detroit Edison has outstanding purchase commitments of approximately $850
million at December31, 1999, which includes, among other things, line
construction and clearance costs and equipment purchases. The Company and
Detroit Edison have also entered into long-term fuel supply commitments of
approximately $621million.
Detroit Edison has an Energy Purchase Agreement Agreement for the purchase of
steam and electricity from the Detroit Resource Recovery Facility. Under the
Agreement, Detroit Edison will purchase steam through 2008 and electricity
through June2024. In 1996, a special charge to net income of $149million
$97million after-tax or $067 cents per share was recorded. The special
charge included a reserve for steam purchase commitments from 1997 through 2008
and expenditures for closure of a portion of the steam heating system. The
reserve for steam purchase commitments was recorded at its present value,
therefore Detroit Edison will record non-cash accretion expense through 2008.
In addition, amortization of the reserve for steam purchase commitments is
netted against losses on steam heating purchases recorded in fuel and purchased
power expense. Purchases of steam and electricity were $35million, $31
million and $34million for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Annual steam
purchase commitments are approximately $38million, $39million, $40million 42million and $43million for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.
In October1995, the MPSC issued an Order approving Detroit Edisons six-year
capacity and energy purchase agreement with Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro
agreed to sell Detroit Edison 300 MW of capacity from mid-May through
mid-September. This purchase will offset a concurrent agreement to lease
approximately a third of Detroit Edisons Ludington 917 MW capacity to
FirstEnergy for the same time period. The net economic effect of
Ludington lease and the Ontario Hydro purchase is an estimated reduction in
PSCR expense of $74million.
61 Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
Detroit Edison and plaintiffs in a class action pending in the Circuit Court
for Wayne County, Michigan Gilford, et al v. Detroit Edison, as well as
plaintiffs in two other pending actions which make class claims Sanchez, et al
v. Detroit Edison, Circuit Court for Wayne County, Michigan; and Frazier v.
Detroit Edison, United States District Court, Eastern District of Michigan,
agreed to binding arbitration to settle these matters. A Consent Judgment
received preliminary Court approval. On October28, 1999, a panel of
arbitrators awarded the plaintiffs $4515million. As a result of sufficient
prior accruals and anticipated insurance coverage, Detroit Edison did not incur
a material 1999 earnings impact due to this award. Detroit Edison anticipates
that the insurance claims process will conclude favorably. While Detroit
Edison can give no assurances as to the final resolution of the claims process,
it does not believe that an unfavorable earnings impact will result.
Other
In addition to the matters reported herein, the Company and its subsidiaries
are involved in litigation and environmental matters dealing with the numerous
aspects of their business operations. The Company believes that such
litigation and the matters discussed above will not have a material effect on
its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
See Notes 3 and 4 for a discussion of contingencies related to Regulatory
Matters and Fermi 2.
NOTE 13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Retirement Plan
Detroit Edison has a trusteed and non-contributory defined benefit retirement
plan Plan covering all eligible employees who have completed six months of
service. The Plan provides retirement benefits based on the employees years
of benefit service, average final compensation and age at retirement. Detroit
Edisons policy is to fund pension cost calculated under the projected unit
credit actuarial cost method.

of employees at January1, 1987.
In addition to the Plan, there are several supplemental non-qualified,
non-contributory, retirement benefit plans for certain management employees.
Savings and Investment Plans
Detroit Edison has voluntary defined contribution plans qualified under Section
401 aand kof the Internal Revenue Code for all eligible employees.
Detroit Edison contributes up to 6% of base compensation for non-represented
employees and up to 4% for represented employees. Matching contributions were
$21million, $21million and $20million for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
Other Postretirement Benefits
Detroit Edison provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. Substantially all of Detroit Edisons
employees will become eligible for such benefits if they reach retirement age
while working for Detroit Edison. These benefits are provided principally
through insurance companies and other organizations.

Benefit costs were calculated assuming health care cost trend rates beginning
at 8% for 2000 and decreasing to 5% in 2007 and thereafter for persons under
age 65 and decreasing from 58% to 5% for persons age 65 and over. A
one-percentage-point increase in health care cost trend rates would increase
the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of benefit costs
by $11million for 1999 and increase the accumulated benefit obligation by $86
million at December31, 1999. A one-percentage-point decrease in the health
care cost trend rates would decrease the aggregate of the service cost and
interest cost components of benefit costs by $9million for 1999 and decrease
the accumulated benefit obligation by $70million at December31, 1999.
65 NOTE 14 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIPin 1995. Under the LTIP,
certain key employees may be granted restricted common stock, stock options,
stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units. Common
stock granted under the LTIP may not exceed 72million shares. Performance
units which have a face amount of $1 granted under the LTIP may not exceed 25
million in the aggregate. As of December31, 1999, no stock appreciation
rights, performance shares or performance units have been granted under the
LTIP.
Under the LTIP, shares of restricted common stock were awarded and are
restricted for a period not exceeding four years. All shares are subject to
forfeiture if specified performance measures are not met. During the applicable
restriction period, the recipient has all the voting, dividend and other rights
of a record holder except that the shares are nontransferable, and non-cash
distributions paid upon the shares would be subject to transfer restrictions
and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the shares themselves. The shares
were recorded at the market value on the date of grant and amortized to expense
based on the award that was expected to vest and the period during which the
related employee services were to be rendered. Restricted common stock
activity for the year ended December31 was

The Company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded for options granted.
As required by SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company has determined the pro forma information as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a modified
Black/Scholes option pricing model American style and the following weighted
average assumptions:

and 1997, respectively, and to reduce earnings per share by $001 for the
year-ended December31, 1999. There was no pro forma effect on earnings per
share for the years ended December31, 1998 and 1997.
NOTE 15 SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION The Companys reportable business segment is its regulated electric utility,
Detroit Edison, which is engaged in the generation, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electric energy in a 7,600 square mile area in
Southeastern Michigan. All other includes non-regulated energy-related
businesses and services, which develop and manage electricity and other
