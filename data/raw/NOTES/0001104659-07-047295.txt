The
accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral
part of these consolidated statements. 39 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note1. Organization
TESSCO Technologies Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation TESSCO or the Company, is a leading provider of integrated product and supply chain solutions
to the professionals that design, build, run, maintain and use wireless,
mobile, fixed and in-building systems. The Company provides marketing and sales
services, knowledge and supply chain management, product-solution
delivery and control systems utilizing extensive Internet and
information technology. Approximately
97% of the Companys sales are made to customers in the United States. The Company takes orders in several ways,
including phone, fax, online and through electronic data interchange.
Note2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Fiscal Year
The Companys fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending
on the Sunday falling on or between March26 and April1 to allow the
financial year to better reflect the Companys natural weekly accounting and
business cycle. The fiscal year ended
April 1, 2007 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal years ended March 26, 2006 and
March 27, 2005 contained 52 weeks.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and highly
liquid investments with an original maturity of 90days or less.
Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts
The
Company uses estimates to determine the amount of the allowance for doubtful
accounts necessary to reduce accounts receivable and unbilled receivables to
their expected net realizable value. The Company estimates the amount of the
required allowance by reviewing the status of past-due receivables and
analyzing historical bad debt trends. Actual collection experience has not
varied significantly from estimates, due primarily to credit policies,
collection experience and the Companys stability as it relates to its current
customer base. Typical payments from a
large majority of our commercial customers are due 30 days from the date of the
invoice. Sales made to consumers are
primarily made through credit card transactions. The Company charges-off receivables deemed to
be uncollectible to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable
balances are not collateralized.
Product Inventory
Product inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market,
and as a result, write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration,
obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. Cost is determined using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method and includes certain charges directly and
indirectly incurred in bringing product inventories to the point of sale. At
fiscal year end 2007 and 2006, the Company has recorded a reserve for excess
and obsolete inventory of $2,984,100 and $3,301,300 respectively. 40 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is
stated at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows 
Usefullives
Information
technology equipment and software
1 5 years
Configuration,
Fulfillment and Delivery technology system
7 years
Furniture,
telephone system, equipment and tooling
3 10 years
Building, building
improvements and leasehold improvements
2 40 years
The Configuration, Fulfillment and Delivery CFD
technology system, which was initially implemented during fiscal year 2005, is
a major automated materials-handling system that is integrated with the Companys
product planning and procurement system.
The Company believes this CFD system has an estimated useful life that
is longer than its other software assets, and thus, is depreciating the system
over a seven-year life.
The Company capitalizes computer software costs that
meet both the definition of internal-use software and defined criteria for
capitalization in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
of their useful lives or the remaining lease term.
Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible
assets acquired. Goodwill amounts and indefinite lived intangible assets are
not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment at least annually. The
Company performs its annual impairment test on the first day of its fourth
quarter. Intangible assets that are not
considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful
life of 4 to 6 years using the straight-line method. Intangible assets other than goodwill are
recorded within other long term assets in the Companys consolidated balance
sheets. The carrying amount of
indefinite lived assets are also reviewed whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be
recoverable. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step approach. Under
the first step, the Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit to
which goodwill has been assigned. The Company then compares the fair value of
each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company
estimates the fair value of each reporting unit by estimating the present value
of the reporting units future cash flows. If the fair value exceeds the
carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds
the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered potentially
impaired and the second step is completed in order to measure the impairment
loss. Under the second step, the Company calculates the implied fair value of
goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets,
including any unrecognized intangible assets, of the reporting unit from the
fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step. The Company
then compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of
goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value
of goodwill, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference.
The indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test
requires the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset. If the
fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an
impairment loss is recognized for an amount equal to the difference. The
intangible asset is then carried at its new fair value. Fair value is
determined using estimates of discounted cash flows. These estimates of
discounted cash flows will likely change over time as impairment tests are performed.
Estimates of fair value are also adversely affected by increases in interest
rates and the applicable discount rate.
Revenue Recognition
The Company
records revenue when 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3 price to the buyer is
fixed and determinable, and 4 collectibility is reasonably assured. The
Companys revenue recognition policy includes evidence of arrangements for
significant revenue transactions through either receipt of a customer purchase
order or a web-based order. The Company
records revenue when risk of loss has passed to the customer. In most cases, shipments are made using FOB
shipping terms. FOB destination terms
are used for a small portion of sales, and revenue is recorded when the product
is received by the customer. Prices are
always fixed at the time of sale.
Historically, there have not been any material concessions provided to
or by customers, future discounts, or other incentives subsequent to a sale. The Company sells under normal
commercial terms and, therefore, only records sales on transactions where
collectibilty is reasonably assured. 41 Because the
Companys sales transactions meet the conditions set forth in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 48, Revenue Recognition When Right of
Return Exists, it recognizes revenues from sales transactions containing sales
returns provisions at the time of the sale.
These conditions require that 1 the price be substantially fixed and
determinable at the date of sale, 2 the buyer is obligated to pay, and is not
contingent on their resale of the product, 3 the buyers obligation to the
Company does not change in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage
of the product, 4 the buyer has economic substance apart from the Company, 5
the Company does not have significant obligations for future performance to
directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer, and 6 the amount of
future returns can be reasonably estimated.
Because the Companys normal terms and conditions of sale are consistent
with conditions 1-5 above, and the Company is able to perform condition 6, it
makes a reasonable estimate of product returns in sales transactions and
accrues a sales return reserve based on this estimate.
Certain companies
have turned to TESSCO to implement supply chain solutions, including purchasing
inventory, assisting in demand forecasting, configuring, packaging, kitting and
delivering products and managing customer relations, from order taking through
cash collections. In performing these solutions, the Company assumes
varying levels of involvement in the transactions and varying levels of credit
and inventory risk. As the Companys solutions offerings continually evolve
to meet the needs of its customers, the Company constantly evaluates its
revenue accounting based on the guidance set forth in accounting standards
generally accepted in the United States. When applying this guidance in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue
Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, the Company looks at the
following indicators: whether it is the primary obligor in the transaction;
whether it has general inventory risk; whether it has latitude in establishing
price; the extent to which it changes the product or performs part of the
service; whether it has responsibility for supplier selection; whether it is
involved in the determination of product and service specifications; whether it
has physical inventory risk; whether it has credit risk; and whether the amount
it earns is fixed. Each of the Companys customer relationships is
independently evaluated based on the above guidance and revenue is recorded on
the appropriate basis. Based on a review
of the factors above, in the majority of the Companys sales relationships, it
has concluded that it is the principal in the transaction and records revenue
based upon the gross amounts earned and booked.
However, the Company has several smaller relationships where it is not
the principal and records revenue on a net fee basis, regardless of amounts
billed less than 5% of total revenue.
If applying this revenue recognition guidance resulted in recording revenue
on a different basis from which the Company has previously concluded, or if the
factors above change significantly, revenues could increase or decrease;
however, gross profit and net income would remain constant.
Other than
subscriber accessory sales relating to the Companys private brand, Wireless
Solutions, TESSCO offers no product warranties in
excess of original equipment manufacturers warranties. The Companys warranty
expense is estimated and accrued at the time of sale. Warranty expense was immaterial for the
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Vendor Programs
Funds received from vendors for price protection,
product rebates and marketing/promotion are recorded to revenue, cost of goods
sold or selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Income depending on the nature of the program. The Company accrues rebates or vendor
incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are
provided in accordance with the terms of the related program.
Classification of Expenses
Cost of goods sold includes cost of products and
freight from vendors to our distribution centers. Product management, distribution, purchasing,
receiving/inspection, warehousing and corporate overhead costs are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses. 42 Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and
handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the Consolidated Statements of Income and totaled $17,392,600, $20,916,500, and
$20,445,600 for the fiscal years ended April 1, 2007, March 26, 2006, and March
27, 2005, respectively.
Advertising
Costs
The Company expenses the production costs of advertising the first time
the advertising takes place, except for the cost of direct-response
advertising, primarily catalog production costs, which are capitalized and
amortized over their expected period of future benefits i.e., the life of the
catalog. Direct catalog production costs included in prepaid and other assets
totaled $798,700 at April 1, 2007 and $189,600 at March 26, 2006. Total
advertising and marketing expense was $2,046,400, $838,400 and $820,000 for
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Stock
Compensation Awards Granted to Team Members
Effective March 27, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. Because
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, which the Company had previously adopted effective
March 29, 2004, and SFAS No123R are generally consistent with respect to
the Companys share-based payments other than as described below, the
adoption of SFAS No123R did not have a material impact on the financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to include in its calculation of
periodic stock compensation expense an estimate of future forfeitures. Prior to fiscal year 2007, in accordance with
SFAS No. 123, the Company only included forfeitures in its calculation of stock
compensation expense when the awards were actually forfeited. The inclusion of estimated in lieu of actual
forfeitures did not have a material impact on our financial position or results
of operations for the year ended April 1, 2007.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, benefits of tax deductions
in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash
flows. SFAS No123R requires excess tax benefits be reported as a
financing cash flow.
Income Taxes
The Company
accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
arise from differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their
reported amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred tax balances are determined by using the tax rate expected to
be in effect when the taxes are paid or refunds received.
Use
of Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates.
Impact of
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which provides
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors
requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure
assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair
value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. The standard
applies whenever other standards  43 require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value.
The standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new
circumstances. The Company will adopt
SFAS No. 157 effective as of April 2, 2007.
The Company does not believe that the new standard will have a material
impact on its financial statements.
In
September2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No108 Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108, to address diversity in practice
in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential for the build
up of improper amounts on the balance sheet. SAB 108 identifies the approach
that registrants should take when evaluating the effects of unadjusted
misstatements on each financial statement, the circumstances under which
corrections of misstatements should result in a revision to financial
statements and disclosures related to the correction of misstatements. SAB 108
is effective for financial statements for an interim period of the first fiscal
year ending after November16, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 during
thethird quarter ofthe Companys2007 fiscal year did not have
an effect onitsconsolidated financial statements.
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprises financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. FIN 48 also provides
guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company will adopt FIN 48 effective as of
April 2, 2007. The Company does not
believe that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits an entity to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not
currently required to be measured at fair value. Entities that elect the fair
value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each
subsequent reporting date. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 159 effective as of
April 2, 2007. The Company is currently
assessing the potential impact of the standard and does not believe that it
will have a material impact on its financial statements.
Note 3. Stock Split Effected in the Form of a
Dividend
On November 29,
2006, the Company issued a stock dividend in order to effect a three-for-two
stock split of the Companys
common stock. All share and earnings per
share numbers prior to the November 29, 2006 stock split including without
limitation all share and share-related numbers included in Notes 11, 14 and 15
below have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock dividend for all
periods presented. The number of
authorized shares of common stock remains at 15 million.
Note4. Acquisition
On April 21, 2006,
the Company acquired substantially all the non-cash net assets of TerraWave
Solutions, Ltd. and its commonly owned affiliate, GigaWave Technologies, Ltd.
for an initial cash payment of approximately $38 million, and additional cash
earn-out payments over a four-year period, contingent on the achievement of
certain minimum earnings thresholds $15 million of the $38 million cash
amount paid at closing is a non-refundable prepayment against future earn-out
payments, if any, amortizable over the four-year period. To the extent that certain minimum earnings
thresholds are not achieved, the Company will not be able to recover this
prepayment. The maximum amount of
contingent future earn-out payments after subtracting the $15 million
prepayment is $155 million. Contingent
payments made under the terms of the purchase agreement are treated as an
additional cost of the acquired businesses and additional goodwill is recorded. Additionally, acquisition related transaction
costs, primarily comprised of legal and accounting fees totaled $89,500. This acquisition was a part of our growth
strategy to increase our product and service offering. 44 The TerraWave business TerraWave, now owned by
TESSCO, designs, configures and offers 80211 Wi-Fi products and accessories,
many of which are branded under TerraWaves private label. Some of the TerraWave-branded products are
sold with products of Cisco Systems under Ciscos Strategic Technology
Integrator program. The GigaWave
business GigaWave, now owned by TESSCO, provides curriculum development and
hands-on, instructor-led training courses for the Wireless Local Area Network
WLAN industry. GigaWave develops and delivers wireless networking courseware
for Cisco Systems, allowing IT professionals to obtain Cisco Wireless
Certifications. Both of these
businesses are included in the Companys network infrastructure segment.
The Company has included the financial results of
TerraWave and GigaWave in its consolidated financial statements beginning April
21, 2006 Acquisition Date. Pro forma
results have not been presented as the impact of the acquisition is not
material and did not involve a significant amount of assets.
This acquisition has been
accounted for as a business combination in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations. Under business
combination accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to TerraWave and
GigaWaves net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on their
estimated fair values as of April 21, 2006.
The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.
The initial purchase price was allocated as set forth below 
Trade accounts receivable

In performing its purchase price allocation, the
Company considered, among other factors, its intention for future use of
acquired assets, analyses of historical financial performance and estimates of
future performance of TerraWave and GigaWave. The Companys estimate of the
fair value of intangible assets was based, in part, on a valuation completed by
an independent valuation specialist, and estimates and assumptions provided by
management. The identified intangible assets consisted of service-marks,
covenants not to compete and customer contracts and relationships. Based upon the purchase price allocation, the
trademarks are estimated to have an approximate fair value of $850,000 and an
indefinite life, the customer contacts are estimated to have an approximate
fair value of $490,000 and an estimated useful life of four years and the
covenants not to compete are estimated to have an approximate fair value of
$290,000 and an estimated useful life of six years. Goodwill noted above and additional goodwill
resulting from earn-out payments are expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. The primary factors
contributing to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill
included expansion of the WLAN product line, expansion of markets for TESSCOs
existing products, the acquired employee force and the expansion of TESSCOs
training business.
For the period of April 21,
2006 through April 1, 2007, the Company increased goodwill by $20 million for
additional earn-out based on achievement of certain earnings thresholds in
accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement. Of this amount, $500,000
has been paid as of April1, 2007, and $15 million was accrued as of
year-end and was paid in May 2007. In
accordance with the acquisition agreement, these earn-out amounts are net of
$375,000 one quarter of the $15 million prepayment of the non-refundable
prepayment against future earn-out payments discussed above. 45 Note 5. Property and Equipment

contacts and covenants not to complete related to our acquisition in fiscal
year 2007 see Note 4.
Note7. Borrowings Under Revolving Credit
Facility
Effective September 30, 2003, the Company established
a $30 million revolving credit facility with Wachovia Bank, N.A. and SunTrust
Bank. This facility has a term expiring
September 2007 and is unsecured. Interest is payable 46 monthly at the
LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 15% to 20%. At April 1, 2007 and March 26, 2006, the
Company had no outstanding balances on its revolving credit facility.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings under
this revolving credit facility was 704%, 600% and 415% for fiscal years 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest expense on this revolving credit facility
for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled $616,000, $151,500 and $10,100,
respectively. Average borrowings under this revolving credit facility totaled
$5,473,400, $1,689,300 and $244,200 and maximum borrowings totaled $17,968,400 10,961,000 and $4,605,000, for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The terms of the credit facility requires the Company
to meet certain financial covenants and ratios and contain other limitations
including a restriction on dividend payments. The current facility is also
subject to a borrowing base, based on levels of trade accounts receivable and
inventory. The Company was in compliance
with the terms of each facility, as applicable, at the end of fiscal years
2007, 2006 and 2005.
On April 28, 2003, the
Company established a stock buyback program.
During fiscal year 2007, the Company purchased 1,043,813 shares of its
outstanding common stock pursuant to the stock buyback program. Of the 1,043,813 shares repurchased during
the fiscal year, 944,363 shares were purchased for approximately $157 million
in one transaction with a large former shareholder. This transaction significantly reduced shareholders
equity, and because the purchase price was funded with borrowings under the
Companys revolving credit facility, it also increased total liabilities. Prior
to entering into this transaction, the Company discussed the proposed
transaction, the anticipated borrowings necessary to consummate the transaction
and its possible impact on the Companys financial condition, with Wachovia
Bank, N.A. and SunTrust Bank, the lenders under the Companys revolving credit
facility and term loan. As a result of
the transaction, the Company did not meet the Maximum Total Liabilities to
Tangible Net Worth covenant under the terms of its revolving credit facility
and term loan at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Company requested and received a waiver
of the covenant from the banks for the second fiscal quarter. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal
year 2007, the Company also did not meet the Maximum Total Liabilities to
Tangible Net Worth covenant; and, the Company once again requested and received
a waiver from the banks that allowed the Company to avoid a covenant violation
under these loans for the third fiscal quarter.
The Company was in compliance with the Maximum Total Liabilities to
Tangible Net Worth covenant, and all other bank covenants, at the end of the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
On May 31, 2007, the Company
replaced this revolving line of credit facility with a new $50 million
revolving line of credit facility with SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank, N.A
see Note 19.
Note 8. Long-Term Debt
On June 30, 2004, the Company refinanced its
previously existing term loan with a bank.
The new term loan had an
original principal amount of $45 million and is payable in monthly
installments of principal and interest with the balance due at maturity, June
30, 2011. The note bears interest at a
floating rate of LIBOR plus 175%. The note is secured by a first position deed
of trust encumbering the Company-owned real property in Hunt Valley,
Maryland. The loan is generally subject
to the same financial covenants as the Companys revolving credit facility see
Note 7, which requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants and
ratios and contains other limitations, including a restriction on dividend
payments. The balance of this note at
April 1, 2007 and March 26, 2006 was $3,900,000 and $4,125,000,
respectively. Interest expense under
this note and the prior term loan was $280,600, $230,700 and $151,900 for
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.
On
October 1, 2005, the Company entered into a receive variable/pay fixed interest
rate swap on a total notional amount of $42 million with Wachovia Bank, N.A.
to avoid the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates on the Companys
existing term bank loan, which bears interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus
175%, and to eliminate the variability in the cash outflow for interest
payments. The interest rate swap
agreement locks the interest rate for the outstanding principal balance of the
loan at 638% through June 30, 2011.
There was no payment due or received at  47 inception of the swap.
No hedge ineffectiveness will be recognized as the interest rate swaps
provisions match the applicable provisions of the term bank loan. This cash flow hedge qualified for hedge
accounting using the short-cut method since the swap terms match the critical
terms of the hedged debt. The fair value
of this interest rate swap, net of tax, at April 1, 2007 and March 26, 2006 of
$21,700 and $65,400, respectively, is included in Other Long-Term Assets and
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Companys Consolidated Balance
Sheet.
At
March 26, 2006, the Company had a note payable outstanding to Baltimore County,
Maryland of $90,200. The balance of the
note was paid during the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. The note bore interest at 475% per annum.
Interest expense under this note was $500, $4,300 and $5,600 for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The note was secured by a subordinate position on Company-owned
real property located in Hunt Valley, Maryland.
At
April 1, 2007 and March 26, 2006, the Company had a note payable outstanding to
the Maryland Economic Development Corporation of $659,400 and $786,700,
respectively. The note is payable in
equal quarterly installments of principal and interest of $37,400, with the
balance due at maturity, October10, 2011. The note bears interest at
300% per annum. Interest expense under this note was $22,200, $25,900 and
$28,700 for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The note is secured by a subordinate position
on Company-owned real property located in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

Lawsuits and claims are filed against the Company from
time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that any
lawsuits or claims pending against the Company, individually or in the

financial condition or results of operations.
Note10. Business Segments
The Company evaluates revenue, gross profit and
inventory in three business segments:
1 Network infrastructure products, which are used to build, repair and
upgrade wireless telecommunications, computing and Internet networks, and
generally complement radio frequency transmitting and switching equipment
provided directly by original equipment manufacturers OEMs; 2 Mobile
devices and accessory products, which include cellular telephones and other
data devices, pagers and two-way radios and related accessories such as
replacement batteries, cases, speakers, mobile amplifiers, power supplies,
headsets, mounts, car antennas and various wireless data devices; and 3
Installation, test and maintenance products, which are used to install, tune,
maintain and repair wireless communications equipment. Within the mobile devices and accessories
line of business, the Company sells to both commercial and consumer markets. The network infrastructure and installation,
test and maintenance lines of business sell primarily to commercial
markets. The Company also regularly
reviews its commercial results of operations in two customer categories. These two customer categories and the
consumer customer category, for which results of operations are also separately
reviewed, are described further below Commercial Public Carriers and Network
Operators. Public carriers and network operators include systems operators that
are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure
system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers.
Commercial Self-Maintained Users,
Governments and Resellers.
Self-maintained user SMU and government customers include commercial
entities such as major utilities and transportation companies, federal agencies
and state and local governments, including public safety organizations.
Resellers include dealers and resellers that sell, install and service cellular
telephone, paging and two-way radio communications equipment primarily for the
consumer and small business markets.
These resellers include local and national proprietorships and
retailers, as well as sales and installation centers operated by cellular and
paging carriers.
Consumers. Consumers include customers
that buy through any of our affinity partner relationships or directly from our
consumer website, YourWirelessSource.comTM.
The Company measures segment performance based on
segment gross profit. The segment
operations develop their product offering, pricing and strategies, which are
collaborative with one another and the centralized sales and marketing
function. Therefore, the Company does
not segregate assets, other than inventory, for internal reporting, evaluating
performance or allocating capital. In
addition, the Company has allocated all goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets to the infrastructure segment for purposes of its annual
impairment tests. Product delivery
revenue and certain cost of sales expenses have been allocated to each segment
based on a percentage of revenues and/or gross profit, as applicable. 49 Segment
activity for the fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows

Note13. Retirement Plans
The Company has a 401k plan that covers all eligible
employees. Contributions to the plan can
be made by employees, and the Company may make matching contributions at its
discretion. Expense related to this
matching contribution was $165,600, $129,000 and $235,900 during fiscal years
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of April 1, 2007 plan assets included
61,545 shares of common stock of the Company.
The Company maintains a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan that covers directors and certain management personnel as
determined by the Board of Directors appointed Benefit Plans Committee. Effective January 1, 2005, the plan was
closed to all new contributions and balances in the old plan now continue to
exist under the prior plan structure.
All plan assets are held in an irrevocable Rabbi trust. These assets and the related liabilities are
included in other long-term assets and other long-term liabilities,
respectively, in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company maintains a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan for Robert B. Barnhill, Jr., chairman, president and CEO of the
Company. This plan is funded through a
life insurance policy for which the Company is the sole beneficiary. The cash surrender value of the life
insurance policy and the net present value of the benefit obligation are
included in other long-term assets and other long-term liabilities,
respectively, in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note14. Earnings Per Share
The dilutive effect of all options and Performance
Stock Units outstanding has been determined by using the treasury stock method.
The weighted average shares outstanding is calculated as follows

yet vested PSUs were included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because all such instruments were dilutive. 52 Note15. Stock-Based Compensation
Effective March 27, 2006, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment, using the modified prospective application transition method. Because the fair value recognition provisions
of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which the Company
had previously adopted effective March 29, 2004, and SFAS No. 123R are
generally consistent with respect to the Companys share-based payments other
than as described below, the adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not have a material
impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to include in its
calculation of periodic stock compensation expense an estimate of future
forfeitures. Prior to fiscal year 2007,
in accordance with SFAS No. 123, the Company only included forfeitures in its
calculation of stock compensation expense when the awards were actually
forfeited. The inclusion of estimated in
lieu of actual forfeitures did not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position or results of operations for the fiscal year ended April 1,
2007. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No.
123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs
were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS No. 123R requires excess tax
benefits be reported as a financing cash flow.
The Companys selling, general and administrative
expenses for the fiscal years ended April 1, 2007, March 26, 2006 and
March27, 2005 include $2,055,300, $702,300 and $886,900, respectively, of
stock compensation expense. Provision
for income taxes for the fiscal years ended April 1, 2007 and March 26, 2006
includes $776,900, $273,900 and $345,000, respectively, of income tax benefits
related to our stock-based compensation arrangements. Stock compensation expense is primarily
related to our Performance Share Unit Program as described below.
The Companys stock incentive plan is the Amended and
Restated 1994 Stock and Incentive Plan the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan allows
for the grant of awards in respect of an aggregate of 1,758,750 shares of the
Companys common stock. As of April 1, 2007, 125,278 shares were available for
issue in respect of awards available for future grant under the 1994 Plan. However, on May 1, 2007, based on fiscal year
2007 results, 449,696 shares related to PSUs were cancelled, and as a result,
those shares were made available for future grants. Accordingly, on May 1, 2007, PSUs covering an
aggregate of 574,974 shares were available for issue pursuant to future awards
under the 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan
allows for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units and
other performance awards. No additional
awards can be made under the 1994 Plan after July 22, 2009, without shareholder
approval of an extension of the plan term.
Options, restricted stock and Performance Stock Unit PSU awards have
been granted as awards under the 1994 Plan.
Shares which are subject to outstanding PSU or other awards under the
Plan, and which are not earned, are returned to the 1994 Plan and become
available for future issuance.
Performance Stock Units: Beginning in fiscal year 2005, the Companys
equity-based compensation philosophy and practice shifted away from awarding
stock options to granting performance-based and time-vested stock grants. Accordingly, in April 2004, the Companys
Board of Directors established a Performance Stock Unit Award Program under the
1994 Plan. Under the program,
Performance Stock Units PSUs have been granted to selected individuals. Each
PSU entitles the participant to earn TESSCO common stock, but only after
earnings per share and, for non-director employee participants, individual performance
targets are met over a defined performance cycle. Performance cycles, which are
fixed for each grant at the date of grant, range from one to three years. Once earned, shares vest and are issued over
a specified period of time determined at the time of the grant, provided that
the participant remains employed by or associated with the Company at the time
of share issuance. Earnings per share
targets, which take into account the earnings impact of this program, are set
by the Board of Directors in advance for the complete performance cycle at
levels designed to grow shareowner value, and for those PSUs which are based
upon multiple year performance cycles, typically represent continual increases
in earnings per share. If actual
performance does not reach the minimum annual or cumulative threshold targets,
no shares are issued. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company records compensation
expense on its PSUs over the service period, based on the number of shares
management estimates will ultimately be issued.
Accordingly, the Company determines the periodic financial statement
compensation expense based upon the stock price at the PSU grant 53 date, managements
projections of future EPS performance over the performance cycle, and the
resulting amount of estimated share issuances, net of estimated
forfeitures. Future changes in factors
impacting the ultimate number of shares granted could cause these estimates to
change significantly in future periods.
The Company estimated the forfeiture rate primarily based on historical
experience and expectations of future forfeitures. The Companys calculated
estimated forfeiture rate was approximately 2%.

Of the 870,172 shares
outstanding, but not yet vested at the end of fiscal year 2007, 280,425 shares
were earned and 449,696 shares have been cancelled on May 1, 2007 based on
fiscal year 2007 activity or cumulative performance for the period of fiscal
years 2005 through fiscal 2007. The
shares were cancelled because cumulative and/or annual earnings per share
performance of the Company did not reach the high end performance targets set
forth in the PSU grants. An additional
140,051 shares were earned based on prior years performance and have not yet
vested as of April 1, 2007. Accordingly,
based on performance through fiscal year 2007, 420,474 shares have been earned,
but are not yet vested. Assuming the
respective participants remain employed by or affiliated with the Company on
these dates, these shares will vest on or about May 1, of 2007, 2008, 2009 and
2010 as follows

On
June 6, 2007, the Compensation Committee, with the concurrence of the full
Board of Directors, granted additional PSUs to selected key individuals,
providing them with the opportunity to earn up to 173,000 additional shares of
the Companys common stock in the aggregate, depending upon whether certain
threshold or goal earnings per share targets are met and individual performance
metrics are satisfied in fiscal year 2008. These PSUs have only one measurement
year fiscal year 2008, with any shares earned at the end of fiscal year 2008
to vest 25% on or about each of May 1 of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, provided
that the participant remains employed by or associated with the Company on each
such date.
As of April 1,
2007, there was approximately $29 million of total unrecognized compensation
costs related to PSUs. These costs are expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 24 years.
Stock Options: For the fiscal year ended April 1, 2007,
options for 11,250 shares were forfeited at an average exercise price of
$1744. For the fiscal year ended March
26, 2006, options for 109,613 shares were forfeited at an average exercise
price of $1065. In accordance with SFAS
No. 123R, the fair value of the Companys stock options have been determined
using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, based upon facts and
assumptions existing at the date of  54 grant.
Stock options granted have exercise prices equal to the market price of the
Companys common stock on the grant date.
The value of each option
at the date of grant is amortized as compensation expense over the option
service period. This occurs without
regard to subsequent changes in stock price, volatility or interest rates over
time, provided that the option remains outstanding. The following table summarizes the pertinent
option information for outstanding options

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax
intrinsic value the difference between the closing stock price on the last
trading day of fiscal year 2007 and the exercise price, multiplied by the
number of in-the-money options that would have been received by the option
holders had all option holders exercised their options on April 1, 2007. This amount changes based on the fair market
value of the Companys common stock.
There
were no options granted during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $676,500, $138,900 and
$86,600.
As of April 1, 2007, there was $35,300 of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options. These costs are
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than one year.
Restricted Stock: During the second quarter of fiscal year
2007, the Company granted 150,000 shares of the Companys common stock to its
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as a restricted stock award under the 1994
Plan. These shares vest ratably over ten
fiscal years, beginning on the last day of fiscal year 2007 and ending on the
last day of fiscal year 2016, subject, however, to the terms applicable to the
award, including terms providing for possible acceleration of vesting. The weighted average fair value for these
shares at the grant date was $1584. No
other shares of restricted stock are currently issued as awards under the 1994
Plan. On April 1, 2007, 15,000 shares of
restricted stock were released and vested.
As of April 1, 2007, there was approximately $21 million of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock. If these shares vest ratably, these
unrecognized compensation costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of approximately 9 years.
Team Member Stock Purchase Plan: During fiscal year 2000, the Company adopted
the Team Member Stock Purchase Plan. This plan permits eligible employees to
purchase up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares of the Companys common stock at
85% of the lower of the market price on the first day of a six-month period or
the market price on the last day of that same six-month period. The Companys expenses relating to this plan
are for its administration and expense associated with the fair value of this
benefit in accordance with SFAS No. 123R.
Expenses incurred for the Team Member Stock Purchase Plan during the
fiscal year ended April 1, 2007 related to SFAS No. 123R was $18,200. During the fiscal year ended April 1, 2007,
7,901 shares were sold to employees under this plan, having a weighted average
market value of $989. 55 Note 16.

income taxes, net of refunds, for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled
$3,367,900, $3,143,100 and $3,159,600, respectively.
Note 18.
Concentration of Risk
The Company is dependent on third-party
equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers for all of its supply of
wireless communications equipment. For fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, sales
of products purchased from the Companys top ten vendors accounted for 43%, 55%
and 60% of total revenues, respectively.
In fiscal year 2007, sales of product purchased from the Companys
largest vendor, Motorola, accounted for approximately 19% of total
revenues. Sales of product purchased
from the Companys second largest vendor, Nokia Inc. accounted for
approximately 11% of our revenues in fiscal year 2007. In fiscal years 2006 and 2005, sales of
products purchased from the Companys largest vendor, T-Mobile, which consisted
primarily of handset sales, accounted for approximately 24% and 41% of total
revenues, respectively. The Company is dependent on the ability of its vendors
to provide products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing terms. Although
the Company believes that alternative sources of supply are available for many
of the product types it carries, the loss of certain principal suppliers, or
the loss of one or more of certain ongoing affinity relationships, could have a
material adverse effect on the Company.
The Companys future results could also be negatively
impacted by the loss of certain customers, and/or the loss of one or more of
certain ongoing affinity relationships. For fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
sales of products to the Companys top ten customer relationships accounted for
30%, 35% and 53% of total revenues, respectively. In fiscal year 2007, sales to the Companys
largest customer relationship, ATT Mobility, a top tier cellular carrier
purchasing phone accessories, accounted for approximately 22% of total
revenues. In fiscal years 2006 and 2005,
sales to the Companys largest customer relationship, T-Mobile, accounted for
approximately 26% and 44% of total revenues, respectively. Sales under the T-Mobile customer
relationship included handsets purchased from T-Mobile, phone accessories
purchased from third-party vendors, and other supply chain service billings.
In mid-September 2005, T-Mobile, previously the
largest affinity and overall customer relationship, completed the transition
from the TESSCO provided e-commerce marketing and sales system to an in-house
web solution and alternative third-party logistics provider, and thus revenues
then ceased from this relationship. 56 Note 19.
Subsequent Events
On May 1, 2007, the Company entered into a Second
Amendment of Agreement of Lease, which among other things, provides for an
extension, from November 30, 2007 to December 31, 2012, of the lease term
provided for under the Agreement of Lease, dated November 3, 2003, as
previously amended January 23, 2007, between the Company and Atrium Building
LLC, under which the Company leases approximately 94,000 square feet in
Timonium, Maryland, where the Companys corporate and administrative offices
are located. The rental rate ranges from $124,700 to $ 144,600 per month
at the close of the extended term.
On May 31, 2007, the Company replaced its $30 million
revolving line of credit facility with a new $50 million revolving line of
credit facility with SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank, N.A see Note 7. This new facility has a term expiring May
2010. Interest is payable monthly at the
LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, which ranges from 125% to 275%. Like the replaced facility, borrowing availability
under this new facility is determined in accordance with a borrowing base. This new facility includes financial
covenants, including a minimum tangible net worth, minimum cash flow coverage
of debt service, and a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio. These financial covenants now also apply to
the existing term loan secured by our Hunt Valley, Maryland facility see Note
8. The new facility also limits the Companys ability to engage in certain
transactions or activities but not limited to investments and acquisitions,
sales of assets, payment of dividends, issuance of additional debt and other
matters.
On June 1, 2007, the Company entered into a Lease
between the Company and MERRITT/BAVAR-VA, LLC, a Maryland limited liability
company, under which
the Company leases approximately 66,000 square feet of office and warehouse
space in Hunt Valley, Maryland, for a term beginning July 1, 2007 and expiring July
31, 2011. The monthly rental fee ranges
from $35,700 to 38,500 throughout the lease term. 57 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
TESSCO Technologies Incorporated We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of TESSCO Technologies Incorporated and subsidiaries as of April 1, 2007
and March 26, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes
in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended April 1, 2007. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of TESSCO Technologies
Incorporated and subsidiaries at April 1, 2007 and March 26, 2006, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended April 1, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As
discussed in Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed the manner in which it accounts for stock-based compensation
upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment on March 27, 2006. s/ Ernst Young, LLP

We
maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and
communicated to management in a timely manner.
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated
this system of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this annual report, and have concluded that the system is
effective. There have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
