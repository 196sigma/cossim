Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on the
Consolidated Financial Statements   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   Indus International, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Indus International, Inc. the Company as of
March31, 2005 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company at March31,
2005 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March31, 2006, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated June12, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/Ernst

Nature of
Business and Significant Accounting Policies   Organization
and Business   Business   Indus International, Inc. the Company develops,
licenses, implements, supports and hosts service delivery
management SDM solutions, which help clients in a
broad array of industries optimize the management of their
customers, assets, workforce, spare parts inventory, tools and
documentation in order to maximize performance and customer
satisfaction while reducing operating expenses. The
Companys software products are comprised of three distinct
suites: Customer Suite, Asset Suite and Service Suite. Customer
Suite, originating from the March 2003 acquisition of Indus
Utility Systems, Inc. IUS, formerly SCT Utility
Systems, Inc., provides the functionality for energy and utility
customers to optimize customer-facing activities, encompassing
call center, customer information tracking, billing and accounts
receivable functions. Asset Suite supports organizations
operations and maintenance workforce, inventory management and
procurement professionals, safety and compliance engineers, and
other decision-making personnel affected by asset care decisions
throughout the enterprise. Service Suite, originating from the
January 2004 acquisition of Wishbone Systems, Inc.
Wishbone provides resource optimization enabling
customers to dispatch resources with all the required tools,
information, and parts at the promised time, optimizing
schedules based on customer or asset demands, travel times,
service level agreements, technician skills requirements and
internal costs. Other complementary products include mobile
computing, enterprise asset integration tools, sophisticated
search capabilities, data warehousing products and integration
to leading ERP products for financial and human resources
functions. Through its acquisitions, the Company is able to
offer a comprehensive suite of SDM solutions to its customers.   The Companys SDM solutions also include consulting,
training and educational services, and customer support, hosting
and outsourcing services. Also offered are comprehensive
implementation programs, strategic consulting, training and
education solutions and three-tiered customer maintenance and
support plans.   Significant
Accounting Policies   Basis of
Presentation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.   Reclassifications   Certain reclassifications were made to prior period financial
statements to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation. Credit
balances for individual accounts previously included in unbilled
accounts receivable were reclassified to deferred revenue,
totaling $06million in 2005. Debit balances in individual
accounts previously included in deferred revenue were
reclassified to unbilled accounts receivable, totaling
$04million in 2005.   Revenue
Recognition   The Company sells its software to customers under contracts that
provide for both software license fees and services. The
revenues from software license fees are recognized in accordance
with AICPA Statement of Position, or SOP, 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, as amended or
interpreted by
SOP98-4
and
SOP98-9,
AICPA Technical Practice Aids, and SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletins. Revenue for software is recognized when persuasive
evidence of a non-cancelable license agreement exists, delivery
has occurred, the license fee is fixed or determinable, and
collection is probable. Revenue from services, which generally
are time and material based, are recognized as the work is
performed. When software is licensed through indirect sales
channels, license fees may be recognized as revenue upon
licensing to the reseller or when the reseller   
49 Table of Contents   licenses the software to an end user customer, depending upon
the Companys history with the reseller, the
resellers financial resources and other factors. In
software arrangements that include rights to multiple software
products
and/or
services, the total arrangement fee is allocated among each of
the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue
is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor
specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of
such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue
are allocated to the delivered elements. Elements included in
multiple element arrangements may consist of software products,
maintenance which includes customer support services and
unspecified upgrades, hosting and consulting services. VSOE is
based on the price generally charged when an element is sold
separately or, in the case of an element not yet sold
separately, the price established by authorized management, if
it is probable that the price, once established, will not change
once the element is sold separately. If VSOE does not exist for
an undelivered element, the total arrangement fee will be taken
to revenue over the life of the contract or upon delivery of the
undelivered element.   Revenue is recognized using contract accounting for arrangements
involving significant customization or modification of the
software or where software services are considered essential to
the functionality of the software. Revenue from these software
arrangements is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion
method with progress to completion measured using specific
milestones, usually labor cost inputs, with revisions to
estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known.
Project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period
in which they become known.   Revenue from maintenance and support services is recognized
ratably over the term of the support contract, typically one
year.   Revenue from outsourcing and web hosting also referred to as
ASP or application service provider services is
recognized based upon contractually agreed upon rates per user
or service, over a contractually defined time period. Under some
web hosting arrangements, customers have a license to the
software and are entitled to take possession of the software at
any time during the hosting period, while other customers are
only entitled to use the software through the hosting
arrangement. For arrangements in which the customer has the
contractual right to take possession of the software at any time
during the hosting period without significant penalty, the
Company recognizes revenue under the accounting policies
disclosed above in the revenue recognition accounting policy for
software arrangements. For arrangements where the customer does
not have the right to take possession of the software, the
Company recognizes license revenue over the course of the
hosting contract period.   Unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts related to
revenue under existing contracts that has been recorded either
as deferred revenue or earned revenue but which has not yet been
billed. Generally, unbilled amounts are billed within one year
of the sale of product or performance of services.   Deferred revenue represents fees for services and software
licenses that have not yet met the criteria to be recognized as
revenue.   Deferred support represents amounts invoiced prior to
performance of support services. Contracts for support services
are typically one year in length and are amortized to revenue
ratably over the contract period. Deferred services are amounts
invoiced prior to performance of consulting services.   Deferred license revenue represents license fee contracts
revenue which was deferred because the criteria for revenue
recognition had not been met. Revenue on these contracts is
recognized when these criteria are met and have occurred.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The functional currencies of the Companys foreign
subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. The
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been
translated into U.S.Dollars. Asset and liability accounts
have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date. The foreign statements of operations have
been translated using average exchange rates. Gains and losses
resulting from translation of the accounts of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries have been reported in other comprehensive
income loss   
50 Table of Contents   within stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting
from foreign currency transactions are included in the
determination of net income loss.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The fair values of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their
carrying amounts.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   Financial instruments where the Company may be subject to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. The Company has
investment policies and procedures that are reviewed
periodically to minimize credit risk. The Companys
customers are generally large companies in the utilities, oil
and gas, defense, pulp and paper and metals and mining
industries. The Company routinely assesses the financial
strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that
its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.   The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated accounts receivable losses resulting from the
inability or failure of its customers to make required payments.
This allowance is formula-based, supplemented by an evaluation
of specific accounts where there may be collectibility risk. On
an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the collectibility of
accounts receivable based upon historical collections and an
assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts using a
combination of factors, including the age of the outstanding
balances, evaluation of the accounts financial
condition, recent payment history, and discussions with the
Companys account executive for the specific customer.
Based upon this evaluation of collectibility, any increase or
decrease required in the allowance for doubtful accounts is
reflected in the period in which the evaluation indicates that a
change is necessary.   The following is an analysis of the activity in the allowance
for doubtful accounts in thousands

4,375     289        3,174        912   Changes to the allowance account are based on an evaluation of
specific accounts and aging categories. The write-offs in 2004
include $15million related to a specific customer dispute
and approximately $11million in a receivable balance
acquired in the IUS acquisition, both of which had been reserved
previously. The increase in fiscal 2006 is attributable to an
increase in the outstanding balance over 120days from date
of invoice.   A single customer in each year represented $19million,
$42million and $19million of the Companys
accounts receivable as of March31, 2004, 2005, and 2006,
respectively.   Restricted
Cash   At March31, 2006, the Company maintained cash deposits
totaling approximately $58million in support of six
standby letters of credit and collateral for a mortgage. These
deposits are classified as restricted cash, of which
$28million is included in current assets and the balance
of $30million in non-current assets. The letters of
credit require the Company to maintain corresponding
compensating balances equal to the amounts of the letters of
credit. A total of $46million in restricted cash will be
released in increments of $23million each in both
December 2006 and May 2008, relative to the expiration of
letters of credit supporting a performance bond and the
Companys leased facilities in SanFrancisco, CA,
respectively. A $06million certificate of deposit, used
as collateral for the Companys $115million mortgage
note payable on its Columbia, SC property, will be released in
April 2008.   
51 Table of Contents   Property
and Equipment   Property and equipment is stated at cost. Equipment under
capital leases is stated at the lower of fair market value or
the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception
of the lease.   Depreciation on office and computer equipment and furniture is
computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of four to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
related lease term or their estimated useful lives. Software
purchased for internal use is amortized using the straight-line
method over estimated useful lives of four to five years.   Software
Development Costs   The Company accounts for software development costs in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed, whereby costs for the development of new
software products and substantial enhancements to existing
software products are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility has been established, at which time any additional
costs are capitalized. Technological feasibility is established
upon completion of a working model. Through December31,
2002, software development costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility were not significant,
and all software development costs were charged to research and
development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations during that time.   The Company capitalized certain internal and external
development costs related to the internationalization of its
products to Asian markets of $77million through
March31, 2004. The product became generally available for
sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and the related
capitalized software development costs became subject to
amortization. These costs are amortized to cost of software
license fees based on the greater of the amount computed using
athe ratio that current gross revenues for the product
bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross
revenues for that product or bthe straight-line method
over the remaining economic life of the product including the
period reported on. Amortization expense recorded for the years
ended March31, 2005 and 2006 was $27million and
$13million, respectively. No additional software
development costs were capitalized during fiscal 2006.   Internal-Use
Software   SOP98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use, requires that entities
capitalize certain costs related to internal use software once
certain criteria have been met. Capitalized internal-use
software development costs associated with the Companys
information systems are included in property and equipment and
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over a three-year
period. The depreciation expense recorded for the years ended
March31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 was approximately
$28million, $22million and $15million,
respectively.   Acquisition-Related
Intangible Assets   Acquisition-related intangible assets are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization, and include values for developed
technology, customer base, contracts and trade names. Acquired
technology is being amortized over the greater of the amount
computed using athe ratio that current gross revenues
for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated
future gross revenues for that product or bthe
straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life
of the product including the period being reported on. Other
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over a period of two to fifteen years. Total amortization
expense for intangible assets was $18million,
$20million and $15million for the years ended
March31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, and is
included in general and administrative expense in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company expects future amortization expense from acquired
intangible assets as of March31, 2006 to be as follows in

4,123     9,066   In accordance with SFASNo144, intangible assets are
reviewed to determine whether they should be tested for
impairment. At March31, 2006, the Company performed this
review and determined no impairment testing was necessary.   Goodwill
and Impairment   Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over
fair value of net assets acquired, is not amortized, but in
accordance with SFASNo142, is subject to annual
impairment testing, and between annual evaluations if events
occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
For purposes of its goodwill impairment testing, the Company
considers itself to be a single reporting unit and assesses
goodwill impairment on an enterprise-wide level. The impairment
test is performed on a consolidated basis and compares the
Companys market capitalization reporting unit fair value
to its outstanding equity reporting unit carrying value. In
accordance with the recommended provisions of
SFASNo142, the Company utilizes its closing stock
price as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the date of
the impairment test in order to compute market capitalization.
The Company has designated December31 as the annual date
for impairment testing.   The Company has recorded goodwill of $04million
associated with the acquisition of IUS and $70million
associated with the acquisition of Wishbone. The Company
performed its impairment test as of December31, 2005, and
concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed since the fair
value exceeded the carrying value. Therefore, no impairment
losses have been recorded through March31, 2006.   NotesPayable   Notes payable represents short-term and long-term borrowings.
The Company includes in current notes payable only those
principal balances which are to be paid within the subsequent
twelve-month period. The current portion of notes payable
balance at March31, 2006 represents the current portion of
a $115million note secured by certain real property
located in Columbia, SC. This note bears interest at an annual
rate of   
53 Table of Contents   65% and is payable in monthly installments of principal and
interest determined on a
15-year
amortization through October1, 2008, at which time the
remaining principal balance of $77million is due and
payable. The Company may extend the maturity date at that time
for one additional five year term at a variable rate of interest.   Guarantees
and Indemnifications   The Company accounts for guarantees and indemnifications in
accordance with Financial Interpretation No45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.   License and hosting agreements with customers generally contain
infringement indemnity provisions. Under these agreements, the
Company generally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the customer in connection with patent, copyright, trademark or
trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with
respect to the customers authorized use of our products
and services. The indemnity provisions generally provide for the
Company to control defense and settlement and cover costs and
damages finally awarded against the customer. The indemnity
provisions also generally provide that if the Company products
infringe, or in the Companys opinion it is likely that
they will be found to infringe, on the rights of a third-party
Indus will, at its option and expense, procure the right to use
the infringing product, modify the product so it is no longer
infringing, or return the product for a partial refund that
reflects the reasonable value of prior use. The Company has not
previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under
these indemnification obligations. The Company accounts for
these indemnity obligations in accordance with
SFASNo5, Accounting for Contingencies,
and records a liability for these obligations when a loss is
probable and reasonably estimable. The Company has not recorded
any liabilities for these arrangements as of March31, 2006.   Services agreements with customers may also contain indemnity
provisions for death, personal injury or property damage caused
by the Companys personnel or contractors in the course of
performing services to customers. Under these agreements, the
Company generally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the customer in connection with death, personal injury and
property damage claims made by third parties with respect to
actions of the Companys personnel or contractors. The
indemnity provisions generally provide for the Companys
control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages
finally awarded against the customer. The indemnity obligations
contained in services agreements generally have no specified
expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the
amount of award covered. The Company has not previously incurred
costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification
obligations and estimates the fair value of these potential
obligations to be nominal. Accordingly, no liabilities have been
recorded for these agreements as of March31, 2006.   Some service agreements require the Company to maintain
performance bonds as security for the performance of the
Companys obligations under those agreements. Some of the
performance bonds require cash to be restricted as collateral.
The obligations to maintain these bonds typically expire either
at a date specified in the applicable contract or upon the
performance of the Companys obligations. Due to the
Companys historical experience of successful software
implementations, the Company has no significant history of
payment under these types of bonds. The Company has not recorded
any liabilities for these arrangements as of March31, 2006.   The Company generally warrants that its software products will
perform in all material respects in accordance with its standard
published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of
the licensed products to the customer for six months to a year,
depending upon the software license. Additionally, contracts
generally warrant that services will be performed consistent
with generally accepted industry standards or, in some
instances, specific service levels through completion of the
agreed upon services. If necessary, provision will be made for
the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on
specific warranty claims and claim history. There has been no
significant recurring expense under these product or service
warranties.   
54 Table of Contents   Advertising
Costs   Advertising costs are charged to expense in the period the costs
are incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $187,000,
$92,000 and $425,000 for the years ended March31, 2004,
2005 and 2006, respectively, and is included in Sales and
Marketing in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations.   Segment
Information   The Company operates in a single segment as defined by
SFASNo131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. See Note11 for
discussion of foreign operations.   Income
Taxes   Income taxes are computed in accordance with
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires the use of the liability method in accounting for
income taxes. Under SFASNo109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured based on differences between the
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse.   Per Share
Data   Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted
average common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted
income per share is computed using net income divided by
weighted average common shares outstanding and the treasury
stock method effect of common equivalent shares.   The components of basic and diluted earnings per share were as
follows in thousands, except per share amounts

to purchase common stock in the amount of 11,395,022 and
9,861,332 were outstanding, respectively. The Company has
excluded all outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase
common stock from the calculation of diluted net loss per share
for the years ended March31, 2004 and 2005 because all
such securities are antidilutive.   As of March31, 2006, options to purchase shares of common
stock in the amount of 3,554,387 were outstanding but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the options exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common shares during the year.   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported in the   
55 Table of Contents   financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Those accounts that are
affected by the use of estimates are revenues from services the
determination of the scope and duration of the engagement and
the status of completion to date, the allowance for doubtful
accounts the valuation of the credit worthiness of our
customers, useful lives of intangible assets economic benefit
associated with acquired intangible assets, and capitalized
software development amortization the anticipated future gross
revenues from product sales.   Stock-Based
Compensation   The Company presently has three forms of compensatory
stock-based compensation: time-based options, restricted stock
grants and performance-based options. As permitted under
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, as amended by SFASNo148,
Accounting for Stock-Based
CompensationTransition and Disclosure,
the Company accounts for time-based options in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
accordingly recognizes no compensation expense for the stock
option grants as long as the exercise price is equal to or more
than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
Compensation expense for the restricted stock grants is equal to
the market value at the date of grant and is charged to earnings
on a straight-line basis over the three or five-year period of
restriction. Compensation expense for the performance-based
options is recorded as the excess of the quoted market price of
the Companys stock over the option price at the end of
each reporting period. At each reporting period end, an
assessment is made regarding the probability of meeting the
performance criteria, which determines the compensation expense
for the period.   
56 Table of Contents   For purposes of pro forma disclosures, as required by
SFASNo123, which also requires that the pro forma
information be determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock option grants under the fair value method
required by SFASNo123, the estimated fair value of
the options is amortized to expense over the options
vesting period. The Companys pro forma net loss including
pro forma compensation expense, net of tax for the years ended
March31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively, is as follows

option plans with an exercise price equal to market price was
$206, $127 and $127 for the years ended March31, 2004,
2005 and 2006, respectively.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
SFASNo154 requires retroactive application of a
voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period
financial statements unless it is impracticable.
SFASNo154 also requires that a change in method of
depreciation, amortization or depletion for long-lived,
non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle.
SFASNo154 replaces APB Opinion No20,
Accounting Changes and SFASNo3,
Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements. SFASNo154 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2005. The Company does
not expect the adoption of the provisions of
SFASNo154 to have a material impact on its results
of operations or financial condition.   On December16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of FASB Statement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Statement123R supersedes APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends
FASB Statement No95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, the approach in Statement123R is similar to
the approach described in Statement123. However,
Statement123R requires all share-based payments to   
57 Table of Contents   employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the income statement based on their fair values.
Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative.   Statement123R must be adopted no later than the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after June15,
2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which
financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company will
adopt Statement123R during its first quarter in fiscal
2007.   Statement123R permits public companies to adopt its
requirements using one of two methods: 1a modified
prospective method in which compensation cost is
recognized beginning with the effective date abased on
the requirements of Statement123R for all share-based
payments granted after the effective date and bbased on
the requirements of Statement123 for all awards granted to
employees prior to the effective date of Statement123R
that remain unvested on the effective date; and 2a
modified retrospective method which includes the
requirements of the modified prospective method described above,
but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts
previously recognized under Statement123 for purposes of
pro forma disclosures either aall prior periods
presented or bprior periods of the year of adoption. The
Company will adopt Statement123R in the first quarter of
fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective method.   As permitted by Statement123, the Company currently
accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion
No25s intrinsic value method and, as such,
generally recognizes no compensation expense cost for employee
stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of
Statement123Rs fair value method will have a
significant impact on the Companys results of operations,
although it will have no impact on the Companys overall
financial position. The impact of adoption of
Statement123R cannot be predicted at this time because
it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future. However, had the Company adopted Statement123R
in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have
approximated the impact of Statement123 as described in
the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in
Note1-Stock-Based
Compensation to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Statement123R also requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating
cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing
cash flows in periods after adoption. However, in the case of
the Company, the existence of its net operating loss
carryforward will preclude recognition of the tax benefit until
the deduction can be used to offset current taxes payable. The
Company cannot estimate what the tax amounts will be in the
future or when they will be recognized, because they depend on,
among other things, when the net operating loss carryforwards
will expire and when employees exercise stock options.

Restructuring
and Settlement Expenses/Benefits   In the year ended March31, 2006, restructuring and
settlement expenses/benefits include 1a
$04million settlement expense related to the termination
of the Companys agreement with a third party to purchase
contract labor development services through 2007, 2a
$04million benefit for revisions to the Companys
assumptions for sublease income for one floor in
SanFrancisco, CA, which was successfully sublet during the
year 3a $02million benefit for finalization of a
lease buyout agreement for the Companys unused floors in
Atlanta, GA, and 4accretion on the existing lease
obligations recorded in prior business restructuring activities.   In the year ended March31, 2005, the Company recorded net
restructuring expenses of $104million for revisions to
accounting estimates from prior business restructurings and for
additional restructuring charges related to office and business
consolidations and employee severance. Revisions to the
Companys assumptions for expected sublease income from two
unoccupied floors in SanFrancisco, CA comprised
$04million of this expense. Further consolidation of
office space in SanFrancisco and Atlanta, GA resulted in
$70million in new restructuring charges for fiscal 2005.
This consolidation included vacating three floors in Atlanta and
one additional floor in SanFrancisco. The remaining
$30million in restructuring expense is associated with
the elimination of approximately 140 positions, including the
transfer of certain functions to the company-owned office
buildings in Columbia, SC and the outsourcing of some
development functions to India. At March31, 2006, a total
of $10million remains in the current and long-term
restructuring accruals for these initiatives all   
58 Table of Contents   of which relates to excess lease costs associated with
subleasing certain floors of the Companys office space in
SanFrancisco, which were vacated relative to the business
consolidation initiative. These restructuring charges have been
recorded in accordance with SFASNo146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities and SFASNo112,
Employers Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits.   Between January1, 2000 and March31, 2004, the
Company recorded restructuring expenses totaling
$218million relating to two restructuring initiatives:
1the relocation of the Companys headquarters from
SanFrancisco to Atlanta; and 2the suspension of
the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense MoD
project. At March31, 2006, a total of $41million
remains in the current and long-term restructuring accruals for
these initiatives, all of which relates to excess lease costs
associated with subleasing certain floors of the Companys
office space in SanFrancisco, which were vacated relative
to the company headquarters relocation initiative.   The restructuring accruals remaining as of March31, 2006
are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Accrued liabilities for amounts due within one year
and Other liabilities for amounts due after one year.   Below is an analysis of the outstanding restructure provisions

Long-Term
Debt   In September 2003, the Company executed a $115million
note secured by certain real property located in Columbia, SC,
which has a carrying value of $158million as of
March31, 2006. This note bears interest at an annual rate
of 65% and is payable in monthly installments of principal and
interest determined on a
15-year
amortization schedule through October1, 2008, at which
time the remaining principal balance of $77million is due
and payable. The Company may extend the maturity date at that
time for one additional five year term at a variable rate of
interest. At March31, 2006, approximately $767,000 of the
promissory note is included in current liabilities and
$88million is classified as long-term debt. Maturities of

Commitments
and Contingencies   The Company leases its office facilities under various operating
lease agreements. These leases require monthly rental payments
in varying amounts through 2012. The Companys leases in
Atlanta and SanFrancisco include lease incentives in the
form of tenant improvement reimbursements, which were recorded
as increases in leasehold improvements and deferred rent. Rental
expense under Company leases is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term and was approximately
$53million, $37million and $30million for
the years ended March31, 2004, 2005, and 2006,
respectively.   These leases also require the Company to pay property taxes,

Stockholders
Equity   The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations
prescribed by Delaware law, to provide for the issuance of
shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish
from time to time the number of shares to be included in each
such series, to fix the powers, preferences and rights of the
shares of each wholly un-issued series and any qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereon, and to increase or decrease
the number of shares of any such series but not below the
number of shares of such series then outstanding, without any
further vote or action by the stockholders. The Board of
Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with
voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the
voting power of other rights of the holders of common stock.
Thus, the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the
Company. The Company has no current plan to issue any shares of
preferred stock.   On January25, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a
Stockholder Protection Rights Plan Rights Plan.
Under the Rights Plan, a dividend of one right
Right for each outstanding share of common stock
was distributed to stockholders of record at the close of
business on February4, 2005. The Rights will be
exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the Companys common stock or
commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire 20% or more of
the Companys common stock. If either event occurs, each
Right would entitle its holder other than the person or group
that exceeded the threshold to purchase, at the exercise price
of $1700, a number of shares of Indus common stock having a
market value equal to twice such exercise price. Also, if Indus
were to be acquired in a merger or other business combination
initiated by a person or group that had acquired 20% or more of
the Companys outstanding stock, each Right would entitle
its holder other than the person or group that exceeded the
threshold to purchase, at such exercise price, a number of
common shares in the acquiring company having a market value
equal to twice such exercise price. Upon being distributed, the
Rights will automatically attach to and trade with all shares of
Indus common stock. The Rights will not trade separately from
the common stock unless and until they become exercisable. The
Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights at any
time prior to the time at which the rights became exercisable.
Unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Board of Directors,
the Rights will expire on January25, 2015.   In July 1999, the Companys Board of Directors approved a
stock repurchase program for up to 2,000,000shares of the
Companys outstanding common stock. The Company is
authorized to use available cash to buy back its shares in open
market transactions from time to time, subject to price and
market conditions. As of March31, 2006, the Company has
repurchased 435,500shares at a cost of approximately
$22million under the program. In fiscal 2006, the Company
cancelled and retired the 435,500shares repurchased under
this plan.   On March5, 2003, the Company completed a private placement
offering to purchasers of approximately 68million shares
of the Companys common stock, par value $0001per
share, at a purchase price of   
62 Table of Contents   $150per share, or a total of approximately
$102million, and approximately $145million of the
Companys 8%Convertible Notes in order to fund the
IUS acquisition. The convertible notes were converted into
9,751,859shares of common stock on July29, 2003.
Related parties, consisting of the Companys then Chairman
and CEO and certain principal stockholders, purchased 11% and
38% of the common stock and convertible notes, respectively. The
Company believes that these transactions were carried out at an
arms-length basis, given the fact that a majority of the
purchasers of these securities were unrelated third parties.   On February9, 2004, the Company completed a private
placement offering of 50million shares of the
Companys common stock, at a price per share of $310, or a
total of approximately $155million. Net proceeds from
this offering were used to replenish cash used in the
acquisition of Wishbone as well as for general working capital
purposes.

Stock
Plans   Stock
Option and Benefit Plans   The Company has four stock plans under which employees,
directors and consultants may be granted rights to purchase
common stock and other stock-based awards.   2004
Long Term Incentive Plan   The 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2004 LTIP
provides for the grant of incentive or non-statutory stock
options to employees, including officers and directors, and
non-statutory options only to non-employee directors and
consultants of the Company. The 2004 LTIP also provides for the
grant of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, deferred stock units, performance awards, dividend
equivalent awards and other stock-based awards to employees,
officers, directors and consultants. A total of
3,500,000shares have been reserved for issuance under the
2004 LTIP, although no more than twenty percent of those shares
may be granted pursuant to awards other than options or stock
appreciation rights. The incentive stock options will be granted
at not less than fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant.   During the year ended March31, 2006, 237,207 restricted
shares were granted under the 2004 LTIP net of
24,400shares cancelled, which will vest at the end of a
three year period. The weighted average grant date fair value of
the restricted stock granted in fiscal 2006 was $237. The
Company amortizes deferred compensation for the restricted
shares over the three year vesting period on a straight-line
basis. Deferred compensation of $563,000 and compensation
expense of $126,000 were recorded in the year ended
March31, 2006 related to these restricted shares.   During the year ended March31, 2006, the Company granted a
total of 174,748 performance based options net of
36,562shares cancelled under the 2004 LTIP, which vest at
the end of a three year period or earlier based on achievement
of established annual performance targets through March31,
2008. The weighted average grant date fair value of the
performance based options granted in fiscal 2006 was $217. The
Company amortizes deferred compensation for the performance
based options based on the Companys progress toward
achievement of the performance targets, comparing the grant date
value of the options and the closing market value of the options
at period end to calculate compensation expense. Deferred
compensation of $171,000 and compensation expense of $128,000
were recorded in the year ended March31, 2006 related to
these options.   1997
Stock Plan   The 1997 Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive or
non-statutory stock options to employees, including officers and
directors, and non-statutory options only to non-employee
directors and consultants of the Company. A total of
12,500,000shares have been reserved for issuance under the
Stock Plan. The incentive stock options will be granted at not
less than fair market value of the stock on the date of grant.
The options generally vest over one to four years and have a
maximum term of ten years.   
63 Table of Contents   1997Directors
Option Plan   The 1997Directors Option Plan provides for automatic
grants of non-statutory stock options to non-employee directors
on the date such person becomes a director and on the date he or
she is re-elected as a director. This plan also provides for
automatic option grants to the chairmen of committees of the
Board of Directors. In July 2005, the Board of Directors
suspended the 1997Directors Option Plan, as a result
of which no options will be issued under this plan following the
suspension unless and until specifically authorized by the
Board. The suspension of this plan does not constitute a final
termination of this plan and does not have any impact on options
issued and outstanding under the plan.   1998
Indus International, Inc. Company Share Option
Plan   The 1998 Indus International, Inc. Company Share Option Plan
the UK Stock Plan provides for the grant of stock
options to employees of Indus International, Ltd. a UK foreign
subsidiary of the Company. A total of 500,000shares of the
Companys common stock have been reserved for issuance
under the UK Stock Plan. The stock options will be granted at
not less than fair market value of the stock on the date of
grant. The options generally vest over one to three years and
have a maximum term of three years.   Combined activity under all of the Companys stock option
plans was as follows

Stock Purchase Plans   The 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan reserved
1,000,000shares of common stock for issuance. The plan
allowed for eligible employees to purchase stock at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the Companys common
stock as of the first day of each six-month offering period or
the fair market value of the stock at the end of the offering
period. Purchases were limited to 10% of each employees
compensation and a maximum of 4,000shares. Effective
November1, 2002, the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan was
concluded as all the authorized shares under the plan had been
distributed. The Company obtained stockholder approval for a new
employee stock purchase plan at its 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders.   The 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan reserved
2,500,000shares of common stock for issuance. The plan
allows for eligible employees to purchase stock at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the Companys common
stock as of the first day of each six-month offering period or
the fair market value of the stock at the end of the offering
period. Purchases are limited to 10% of each employees
compensation and a maximum of 4,000shares. Under the plan,
the Company issued 252,740 and 251,889shares in the years
ended March31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, at prices
ranging from $176 to $207per share.

Alternative
Method of Valuing Stock Options   For employee stock options granted with exercise prices at or
above the existing market, the Company records no compensation
expense. Compensation costs for stock options granted to
employees is measured by the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of the Companys stock at the date of grant
over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.   Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required by SFASNo123, as amended by
SFASNo148, and described and disclosed in
Note1, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value
method of that Statement. The fair   
65 Table of Contents   value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following

Employee
Benefit and Profit-Sharing Plans   The Company has a defined contribution 401K plan. All
employees over the age of 21 who have completed at least ninety
days of service are eligible to participate. Each participant
may elect to have amounts deducted from his or her compensation
and contribute to the plan up to the maximum amount as specified
by the Federal law. All employee contributions are fully vested
at the time the employee becomes an active participant. The
Companys matching contributions are equal to 50% of
pre-tax contributions, up to 3% of eligible pay. This match is
distributed to all eligible employees participating in the plan.
The matching contribution is paid quarterly. The Companys
matching contributions were approximately $667,000, $506,000 and
$445,000 for the years ended March31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
respectively.

Segment
Information and Geographic Information   The Company operates in one reportable segment, service delivery
management SDM and sells software products and
services offerings to enable the three principal components of
SDM: asset management, customer management and field service
management. Neither the acquisition of IUS nor the acquisition
of Wishbone resulted in a new business segment for the Company.   Geographic revenue information for the years ended
March31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 is based on customer
location, and is shown in thousands. The Company believes that
providing this data by customer location aligns with the way the
business is managed. Long-lived asset information is based on
the physical location of the assets.

decreased approximately $27million for the year ended
March31, 2006. Approximately $26million of the
valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset at March31,
2006 relates to benefits of stock option deductions which, when
recognized, will be directly allocated to contributed capital.   As of March31, 2006, the Company had federal net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $649million. The
Company also had federal research tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $79million and state research tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $08million. The federal
net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire
beginning in the year 2012, if not utilized. The Company has
foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$117million. The Company has provided a tax accrual of
$27million for potential tax liabilities related
primarily to its non-US operations.   The Company has determined that utilization of the net operating
losses and credits is likely to be subject to annual limitations
due to a greater than 50% change in the Companys ownership
during the three-year period ending in fiscal year 2005, under
the change in ownership provisions of
Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
provisions. These limitations may result in the expiration of
net operating losses and credits before utilization.

Litigation   In February 2003, Integral Energy Australia brought a claim
against IUS which was then known as SCTUtility Systems,
Inc. in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia,
relating to the implementation of IUS software. On March5,
2003, the Company acquired IUS from Systems and Computer
Technology Corporation SCT and subsequently merged
IUS into the Company. The Company is now the defendant in this
lawsuit. The amount of damages asserted against the Company is
not determinable. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase
Agreement among the Company and SCT and its affiliates, SCT and
those affiliates of SCT that were a party to the Purchase
Agreement agreed to defend the Company against the claims in
this suit and to indemnify the Company from all losses relating
thereto.   From time to time, the Company is involved in other legal
proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. The
outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty. The
Company intends to defend itself vigorously in these actions.
However, any settlement or judgment may have a material adverse
effect on the Companys results of operations in the period
in which such settlement or judgment is paid or payment becomes
probable. The Company does not believe that, individually or in
aggregate, the legal matters to which   
68 Table of Contents   it is currently a party are likely to have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial condition.   
14.
Acquisitions   IUS   On March5, 2003, the Company completed its acquisition of
IUS, a provider of customer relationship management software
products for energy and utility companies principally in North
America, for an aggregate purchase price of $358million.
The acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting and the results of operations are included in the
Companys operations beginning March6, 2003.   Wishbone   On January21, 2004, the Company acquired Wishbone, a
provider of file service management and optimization software,
for an aggregate purchase price of $86million. The
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, and the results of operations have been included in
operations after January21, 2004.

of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its CEO and CFO, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management, with the participation of the CEO and
CFO of the Company, has performed an evaluation of the design
and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as of March31, 2006. Based on that evaluation,
the CEO and CFO of the Company concluded that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
March31, 2006.   Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.   Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in
Rule13a-15f
under the Exchange Act. Under section404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of its most recent fiscal year
and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys
internal control over financial reporting is effective. The
Companys internal control system is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of published financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework set
forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework,
our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2006.   The Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst Young LLP, has audited and issued a
report on managements assessment of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. This report appears
below.   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   Management, with the participation of the CEO and CFO of the
Company, has evaluated any changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the most recent fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation,
management, the CEO and the CFO of the Company have concluded
that there were no changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal
quarter that   
70 Table of Contents   have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.   Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls   The Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, does
not expect that our Disclosure Controls or our internal control
over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the control systems objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part
on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures.   
71 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting   The Board of Directors and Stockholders   Indus International, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, that Indus International, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of March31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission the COSO criteria. Indus International, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that Indus
International, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2006, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, Indus International, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Indus International, Inc. as of
March31, 2005 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March31, 2006 of Indus International, Inc. and our report
dated June12, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.   /s/Ernst
