Item8, Note3, Restatement of
Consolidated Financial Statements, for the discussion of
the Restatement related to our stock option grants.   Prior to September1, 2005, we accounted for all employee
and non-employee director share based compensation awards using
the intrinsic value method under APB25, and provided the
required disclosures in accordance with SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS123. On September1, 2005, we
adopted SFASNo123R, Share-Based
Payment SFAS123R, using the modified
prospective transition method. Under both APB25 and
SFAS123R, the requisite service period over which share
based compensation is expensed generally equals the vesting
periods of the awards.   Under SFAS123R, our share based compensation is based on
the fair value of the option at the grant date. The fair value
is affected by the stock price, as well as the
Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model the BSM
valuation assumptions, including the volatility of the stock
price, expected term of the option, risk-free interest rate and
dividend yield. We use the BSM for estimating the fair value on
the date of the grant of stock options. We used the following
weighted average assumptions in the BSM

fair value of the grants and therefore, share based compensation
expense, are the expected life and expected volatility. The

61 Table of Contents   Sensitivity
Analysis Stock Option Restatement   In connection with the Restatement, we determined that during
the period from June 1994 through September 2006, we applied
incorrect measurement dates in our accounting for certain stock
options.   Based on the available facts and circumstances surrounding our
stock option granting practices, we adopted a methodology for
determining the most likely measurement dates. We believe the
application of this methodology indicated the most likely date
when the number of options granted to each employee was approved
and the exercise price and number of shares were known with
finality. When there was not conclusive documentation or
evidence of an earlier date, we believe the best indication of
finality and approval is the Equity Edge Record Added Date.   However, we acknowledge that many of the measurement date
conclusions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each
stock option grant and involved the application of significant
judgment. Because the revised measurement date is subjective, we
performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of
using alternative measurement dates for certain grants other
than the Equity Edge Record Added Date.   We performed the sensitivity analysis to the annual Management
and Individual Grants issued under APB25 for the period
June 1994 through August31, 2005. This sensitivity
analysis also included the stock options issued to the Former
CEO from June 1994 through October 2002 the date when we began
filing timely Forms4to the extent the Equity Edge
Record Added Date was used as the most likely measurement date.
To perform the sensitivity analysis, we used the highest and
lowest market price of APOL or UPX Online stock for the period
from the original grant date to the revised measurement date.
For the Management and Individual grants issued under
APB25, the Restatement resulted in a pre-tax increase in
share based compensation expense of $529million from the
amounts previously reported. The use of the low stock prices
during the period from the stated grant date to the revised
measurement date instead of the price on the revised measurement
date would result in no increase in share-based compensation
expense from the amounts previously reported. The use of the
high stock prices during the period from the stated grant date
to the revised measurement date instead of the price on the
revised measurement date would result in a pre-tax increase of
$89million from the share based compensation expense
reflected in the Restatement.   We believe our methodology, based on the best evidence
available, results in the most likely measurement date for our
stock option grants.   Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   See also Item8, Note3, Restatement of
Consolidated Financial Statements, for the discussion of
the Restatement related to our allowance for doubtful accounts.   We extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are
enrolled at our schools and programs, and based upon past
experience and current trends, we establish an allowance for
doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables. Our
allowance estimation methodology has been refined and considers
a number of factors that, based on collections history, we
believe have an impact on our ability to collect student
receivables.   We monitor our collections and write-off experience and
periodically determine whether adjustments to our allowance
percentage estimates are necessary. As a result, we believe that
our allowance estimation methodology reflects historical trends
as well as our most recent collections experience and reasonably
estimates future losses attributable to receivable write-offs.
Our standard allowance estimation methodology is periodically
evaluated for sufficiency by management and modified as
necessary. Changes to the design of our standard allowance
estimation methodology, including our allowance percentage
estimates, may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful
accounts and our financial results.   When a student with TitleIV loans withdraws from UPX or
WIU, we are sometimes required to return a portion of
TitleIV funds to the lenders. We are generally entitled to
collect these funds from the students, but collection of these
receivables is significantly lower than our collection of
receivables from students who remain in our educational
programs. An increase in the amount of Return to
Lender and a lower collection rate is factored into the
determination of an appropriate allowance amount.   
62 Table of Contents   A one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful
accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables as of
August31, 2006, would have resulted in a pre-tax change in
net income of $21million $13million after-tax.
Additionally, if our allowance for doubtful accounts was to
change by 1% of tuition and other revenues, net for the fiscal
year ended August31, 2006, we would have recorded a
pre-tax change in net income of approximately $248million
$149million after-tax.   Accounts receivable are written off when the account is deemed
to be uncollectible. This typically occurs once we have
exhausted all efforts to collect the account, which includes
collection attempts by our employees and outside collection
agencies.   Insurance
Reserves   We record liabilities for claims and related expenses that are
estimable and probable related to our self-insured medical and
dental insurance programs in accordance with the contractual
terms of the insurance policies. Accounting for insurance
liabilities that are self-insured involves uncertainty because
estimates and judgments are used to determine the ultimate
liability for reported claims as well as claims incurred but not
reported. We consider our historical experience in determining
the appropriate insurance reserves. We record reserves for
claims incurred but not recorded assuming a
45-day lag
in the submission of claims. The following table displays the
required increase or decrease to the insurance reserve if
current claim lag time trends differed from our historical claim
lag time experience

27   Loss
Contingencies   In accordance with SFASNo5, Accounting for
Contingencies SFAS5, when we become
aware of a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of any loss
or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss will
result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated,
we record a liability for the loss. The liability recorded
includes probable and estimable legal costs associated with the
claim or potential claim. If the loss is not probable or the
amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we disclose
the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably
possible and the amount is material. For matters where no loss
contingency is recorded, our policy is to expense legal fees as
incurred.   Accounting
for Income Taxes   We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method
in accordance with SFAS109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS109. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted laws and tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. Management judgment is required in determining the
provision for income taxes and, in particular, whether or not a
valuation allowance should be recorded against our deferred tax
assets.   In relation to the Restatement, certain tax deductions in prior
years with respect to compensation attributable to the exercise
of certain stock options by executive officers may be in
question. Under IRC Section162m, the amount of such
deduction per covered executive officer is limited to
$10million per year, except to the extent the
compensation qualifies as performance-based. Compensation
attributable to options with revised measurement dates may not
have qualified as performance-based compensation. Accordingly,
we may have claimed deductions with respect to those exercised
options that were in excess of the limit imposed under IRC
Section162m. As a result, we have accrued our best
estimate with respect to potential tax liabilities, including
interest and penalties for   
63 Table of Contents   the taxable years 2003 through 2005 which are currently our
only open years subject to adjustment for federal tax purposes,
of approximately $411million as of August31, 2006.
These accruals have been recorded because we believe it is more
likely than not that the deductions will be disallowed by the
IRS. For prior periods where a liability existed and where the
statute of limitations has expired, the accrual relating to that
period has been reversed in the appropriate period.   Results
of Operations   We have included below a discussion of our operating results and
significant items which explain the material changes in our
operating results during the last three years. All comparative
statements and historical financial information discussed is
based on the restated financial statements for the periods

Share based compensation in 2005 and 2004 is related to the 2004
conversion of the UPX Online stock options into Apollo Group
ClassA stock options. Share based compensation expense
resulting from the revised measurement dates is included in
instructional costs and services, selling and promotional, and
general and administrative expenses.   We categorize our expenses as instructional costs and services,
selling and promotional, and general and administrative.   Instructional costs and services at UPX, WIU, and the CFP
consist primarily of costs related to the delivery and
administration of our educational programs and include faculty
compensation, administrative salaries for departments that
provide service directly to the students, financial aid
processing costs, the costs of educational materials sold,
facility leases and other occupancy costs, bad debt expense,
technology spending in support of student systems and
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment. UPX and
WIU faculty members are primarily contracted for one course
offering at a time. All classroom facilities are leased or, in
some cases, are provided by the students employers at no
charge to us. Instructional costs and services at IPD consist
primarily of program   
64 Table of Contents   administration, student services, and classroom lease expense.
Most of the other instructional costs for IPD-assisted programs,
including faculty, financial aid processing, and other
administrative salaries, are the responsibility of IPDs
Client Institutions.   Selling and promotional costs consist primarily of compensation
and employee benefits for enrollment counselors, management and
support staff, corporate marketing, advertising, production of
marketing materials, and other costs related to selling and
promotional functions. We expense selling and promotional costs
as incurred.   General and administrative costs consist primarily of
administrative salaries, occupancy costs, depreciation and
amortization, and other related costs for departments such as
executive management, information systems, corporate accounting,
human resources, and other departments that do not provide
direct services to our students. To the extent possible, we
centralize these services to avoid duplication of effort.   Tuition
and Other, Net Revenues   Information about our tuition and other net revenues by
reportable segment on a percentage basis is as follows

net   1000     1000     1000     Our tuition and other revenues, net increased by 101% in 2006
primarily due to a 54% increase in average quarterly Degreed
Enrollments and selective tuition price increases depending on
the geographic area and program. These increases include a
1130% increase in average quarterly Degreed Enrollments in our
lower-tuition associates degree programs. As of
August31, 2006, 262% of our students are Degreed
Enrollments in associates degree programs compared with 154% of
our students as of August31, 2005.   Our tuition and other revenues, net increased by 251% in 2005
primarily due to an 182% increase in average quarterly Degreed
Enrollments and generally a 4-6% increase in average tuition
prices depending on the geographic area and program. The
remaining increase is related to increased pricing and higher
sales of online course materials.   Tuition and other revenues, net at Other Schools increased as a
percentage of total revenues in 2005 and 2006 due to enrollment
in associates degree programs at Axia College of WIU during
2005. Axia College began offering these programs in September
2004. In March 2006 our third quarter of fiscal 2006, we began
offering all Axia College programs within UPX, instead of WIU.
Therefore, we expect the percentage of revenue within Other
Schools to decrease in fiscal 2007.

See Note3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item8 of this
Form10-K.   Instructional costs and services as a percentage of tuition and
other net revenues increased in 2006 versus 2005 due primarily
to an increase in bad debt expense. The increase is the result
of increased aged accounts receivable and write-offs as a result
of increased student withdrawals and an increase in Return
to Lender dollars for students who withdraw from UPX or
WIU. When a student withdraws from UPX or WIU, we are sometimes
required to return a certain portion of any disbursed student
financial aid loans to the lender Return to Lender
dollars for TitleIV recipients. We are generally entitled
to collect these funds from the students, but collection on
these receivables is significantly lower than receivables for
students who remain in our educational programs. During the
second half of our fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, we
were required by regulatory authorities to modify our Return to
Lender calculations when a student withdraws from UPX or WIU.
These changes forced us to return additional dollars to the
lenders than had previously been required. We attempt to collect
these funds from our students but as a result of the increased
Return to Lender dollars, our bad debt expense
significantly increased in 2005 and 2006.   Instructional costs and services as a percentage of tuition and
other net revenues decreased in 2005 versus 2004 due primarily
to greater tuition and other net revenues being spread over the
fixed costs related to centralized student services.
Additionally, a $98million settlement with the
U.S.Department of Education in 2004 related to the
U.S.Department of Educations program review
contributed to the decline. Finally, the impact of the changes
related to Return to Lender dollars discussed above
increased bad debt expense in 2005 versus 2004.

revenue in 2006 versus 2005 and in 2005 versus 2004 due
primarily to an increase in the number of enrollment advisors to
support leads for our Internet advertising campaign and the
establishment of a national qualifying center for efficiency and
timelines in lead distribution. We also increased the
entry-level pay for enrollment advisors in an attempt to bring
in more highly qualified staff. Advertising costs increased in
2005 over 2004 as a result of a planned focus on investment in
increasing Internet-based leads.

See Note3, Restatement of Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in Item8 of this
Form10-K.   Included in 2006 employee compensation and related expenses are
severance expenses related to the Former CEO of
$260million. Excluding this amount, general and
administrative expenses increased $294million, or 311%.
This remaining increase is primarily due to   
$39million increase in legal, audit, and corporate
insurance expenses primarily due to legal defense costs
associated with class action complaints   
$96million increase in share based compensation charges
primarily resulting from the adoption of SFAS123R   
$40million of increased administrative space and
depreciation costs due to higher information technology spending
primarily as a result of the opening of a new data center in
August 2005;and   
other increases including increased employee headcount to
support our growth in 2006.   General and administrative expenses increased $102million
in 2005 versus 2004 due primarily to increases in employee
compensation and related expenses and administrative space and
depreciation, as a result of our new data center that was
completed in the third quarter of 2005, and an increase in
legal, audit and corporate insurance costs associated with our
class action complaints.   Goodwill
Impairment   Goodwill is primarily the result of our acquisition of CFP in
September 1997. As of August31, 2006, we concluded that
the goodwill for CFP was impaired in the amount of
$202million. This impairment was included in our Other
Schools segment. In performing our annual impairment test, we
assessed the recoverability of the goodwill by evaluating the
future discounted cash flows and the fair value of CFPs
tangible and intangible assets. The total discounted future cash
flows was determined to be significantly less than our original
expectations due to slower than forecasted revenue growth. After
the impairment charge, our remaining goodwill totaled
$169million, which represents approximately 13% of total
assets. There are no other long-lived assets at CFP that we
believe are impaired. Additional impairment of this goodwill
could affect future results of operations.

increase in interest rates partially offset by a decrease in
average cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and
marketable securities. The $05million increase in 2005
versus 2004 includes a $17million non-cash impairment in
2004 for the write down of an investment in a venture capital
fund. Excluding this non-cash impairment, interest income and
other, net would have decreased in 2005 versus 2004 by
$12million. The decrease in 2005 was primarily
attributable to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash and marketable securities between periods
primarily as a result of stock repurchases and capital
expenditures, partially offset by increases in overall interest
rates.   Provision
for Income Taxes   Our effective income tax rate decreased to 379% in 2006, from
401% in 2005, primarily as a result of a reduction in
non-deductible compensation and state taxes, combined with an
increase in tax-exempt interest. Our effective income tax rate
was essentially flat between 2005 and 2004.   Liquidity,
Capital Resources, and Financial Position   Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe
that our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and
cash generated from operations will satisfy our working capital
needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, commitments,
acquisitions and other liquidity requirements associated with
our existing operations through at least the next 12months
and the foreseeable future. We believe that the most strategic
uses of our cash resources include potential acquisition
opportunities, possible repurchase of shares, and
start-up
costs associated with new campuses. There are no transactions,
arrangements, and other relationships with unconsolidated
entities or other persons of whom we are aware of that are
reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the
availability of our requirements for capital during at least the
next 12months.   Cash
and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities   Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased
$499million, or 109%, to $4087million as of
August31, 2006 from $4586million as of
August31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable
securities represented 358% and 319% of our total assets as of
August31, 2005 and August31, 2006, respectively. The
reduction was primarily due to $5149million of
repurchases of Apollo Group ClassA common stock and
$1112million of capital expenditures, partially offset by
cash provided by operating activities of $5510million and
cash provided by the issuance of Apollo Group ClassA
common stock of $290million.

34days, respectively. Our accounts receivable and DSO are
primarily affected by collections performance.   Investing Activities.Investing activities
provided $956million in cash during 2006 compared to
$1935million in 2005. The 2006 amount primarily includes
net maturities of marketable securities including auction rate
securities of $2162million, partially offset by
$1112million of capital expenditures, which includes
$666million related to the build out of our new corporate
headquarters building in Phoenix, Arizona. The 2005 amount
primarily includes net maturities of marketable securities
including auction rate securities of $2866million,
partially offset by $945million of capital expenditures,
including $57million for our new corporate headquarters.
We expect to   
70 Table of Contents   spend $900 to $1100million on capital expenditures in
2007, of which approximately $40-50million will be
utilized for our new corporate headquarters building.   On June20, 2006, we entered into an option agreement
which was amended in November 2006with Macquarie
Riverpoint AZ, LLC Macquarie. The option agreement
allows us to execute a sale and simultaneous leaseback of the
new corporate headquarters buildings located in Phoenix,
Arizona. We anticipate beginning to occupy this building late in
fiscal year 2007 and finishing construction by the end of the
third quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, we
anticipate executing the sale lease-back option. When the
sale-leaseback option is exercised, we anticipate receiving
approximately $170million in cash for the building and
land, and expect to generate a gain on the sale for
approximately $20-30million. The gain will be deferred
over the
12-year term
of the lease agreement.   Financing Activities.Financing activities
used $4748million of cash during 2006 compared to
$7554million in 2005. These amounts primarily relate to
repurchases of our ClassA common stock, net of proceeds
from stock option exercises.   The Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase
outstanding shares of Apollo Group ClassA common stock,
from time to time, depending on market conditions and other
considerations.   Shares of Apollo Group ClassA common stock repurchased and

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk   Impact of
Inflation   Inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical
operations.   Interest
Rate Risk   Our portfolio of marketable securities includes numerous
issuers, varying types of securities, and varying maturities. We
intend to hold all securities, other than auction-rate
securities, to maturity. During the fiscal year ended
August31, 2006, interest income earned on our portfolio of
marketable securities would have decreased $30 to
$40million due to a 100basis point decrease in
interest rates. We manage this interest rate risk by monitoring
market conditions and the value of these assets. We have no
significant short-term or long-term debt; therefore, we do not
face any other significant interest rate risk.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   A substantial portion of credit extended to students is paid
through the students participation in various federal
financial aid programs authorized by TitleIV of the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as reauthorized the Higher
Education Act, which the Company refers to as
TitleIV programs. The following table
summarizes the Companys total revenues from TitleIV
programs for the fiscal years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004.   	
2006   2005   2004   $ in millions   Total TitleIV funding

enrolled. Receivables are not collateralized; however, credit
risk is reduced as the amounts owed by any individual student is
small relative to the total tuition receivable and the customer
base is geographically diverse.

73 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   Apollo Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Phoenix, Arizona   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Apollo Group, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as
of August31, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated
statements of income, other comprehensive income,
shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended August31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Apollo Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of August31, 2006
and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.   As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based
Payment, on September1, 2005.   As discussed in Note3 to the consolidated financial
statements, the accompanying fiscal 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements have been restated.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of August31, 2006, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
May21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting and an
adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting because of material
weaknesses.   /s/DELOITTE

Significant
Accounting Policies   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
GAAP requires management to make certain estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.   Principles
of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Apollo and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Revenue
Recognition   The Companys educational programs range in length from
one-day
seminars to degree programs lasting up to four years. Students
in the degree programs generally enroll in a program of study
encompassing a series of five- to nine-week courses taken
consecutively over the length of the program. Generally,
students are billed on a
course-by-course
basis when the student first attends a session, resulting in the
recording of a receivable from the student and deferred revenue
in the amount of the billing. Students generally fund their
education through grants
and/or loans
under various TitleIV programs, tuition assistance from
their employers or personal funds.   Tuition and other net revenues consist largely of tuition and
fees associated with different educational programs as well as
related educational resources such as access to online
materials. Tuition and other revenues are shown net of discounts
relating to a variety of promotional programs including military
discounts, special promotional incentives designed to generate
new student enrollment, early payment discounts and other
incentives. Tuition benefits for the Companys employees
are included in tuition revenue and as a part of employee
benefit expense. Total employee tuition benefits were
$529million, $482million, and $349million
for the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   The following table presents the most significant components as
percentages of total tuition and other, net revenue for the
years ended August31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

classroom-based learning. Tuition revenue is recognized pro
rata, on a weekly basis, over the period of instruction as
services are delivered to students. During certain periods of
the year and in certain businesses, the Company adjusts its
revenue recognition to account for holiday breaks such as
Christmas and Thanksgiving.   IPD services revenues consist of the contractual share of
tuition revenues from students enrolled in IPD programs at
Client Institutions. IPD contracts with Client Institutions to
provide services including, but not limited to, management
consulting and training; program development; program
administration; instructor and student recruiting; and student
accounting, collection and recordkeeping. The contractual share
varies by contract and may change over time. The Companys
contractual share ranges between 30% and 50%. Contracts
generally have terms of 10years with provisions for
renewal. The portion of service revenue to which the Company is
entitled under the terms of the contracts is recognized on a pro
rata basis as defined.   Application and related fees consist of the fees students
pay when submitting an enrollment application and the
application costs related to the expenses associated with
processing the applications. Both the fees and the costs are
deferred and recognized over the average length of time it takes
for a student to complete a program of study.   
82 Table of Contents   APOLLO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Online course material revenue relates to online course
materials delivered to students over the period of instruction.
Revenue associated with these materials is recognized pro rata
over the period of the related course to correspond with
delivery of the materials to students.   Other revenue is primarily composed of non-tuition
generating revenues, such as renting classroom space and other
student support services. This revenue is recognized as these
services are provided.   Generally, tuition and other net revenues vary from period to
period based on several factors, including 1the
aggregate number of students attending classes, 2the
number of classes held during the period, and 3the
tuition price per credit hour.   Tuition and other net revenues exclude any applicable state and
city sales taxes. Upon conclusion of a taxable transaction, the
amount of tax collected is withheld and subsequently paid to the
appropriate taxing jurisdiction.   Concentration
of Credit Risk   A substantial portion of credit extended to students is paid
through the students participation in various federal
financial aid programs authorized by TitleIV of the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as reauthorized the Higher
Education Act, which the Company refers to as
TitleIV programs. The following table
summarizes total revenues from TitleIV programs for the
fiscal years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004.

620     598     558     The Company is subject to annual compliance audits as well as
reviews by the U.S.Department of Education. The Company
believes it is in compliance with TitleIV requirements.   The Company extends unsecured credit to a portion of the
students enrolled. Receivables are not collateralized; however,
credit risk is reduced as the amount owed by any individual
student is small relative to the total tuition receivable and
the customer base is geographically diverse.   Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   See also Note3, Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements, for the discussion of the
restatement related to the allowance for doubtful accounts.   The Company reduces accounts receivable by an allowance for
amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. Estimates
are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and
are based on historical collection experience and current
trends. In determining these amounts, the Company looks at the
historical write-offs of its receivables. The Company monitors
its collections and write-off experience to assess whether
adjustments are necessary. When a student with TitleIV
loans withdraws from UPX or WIU, the Company is sometimes
required to return a portion of TitleIV funds to the
lenders. The Company is generally entitled to collect these
funds from the students, but collection of these receivables is
significantly lower than its collection of receivables for
students who remain in the Companys educational programs.
An increase in the amount of return to the lenders and a lower
collection rate are factored into the determination of an
appropriate allowance amount. Management periodically evaluates
the standard allowance estimation methodology for propriety and
modifies as necessary. In doing so, the Company believes its
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the most recent
collections experience and is responsive to changes in trends.
The Companys accounts receivable are written off once the
account is deemed to be uncollectible. This typically occurs
once the Company has exhausted all efforts to collect the
account, which include collection attempts by Company employees
and outside collection agencies.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Cash
and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market
funds, bank overnight deposits, and tax-exempt commercial paper,
which are all placed with high-credit-quality institutions. The
Company has not experienced any losses on its cash and cash
equivalents.   Restricted
Cash   A significant portion of the Companys revenue is received
from students who participate in government financial aid and
assistance programs. Restricted cash primarily represents
amounts received from the federal and state governments under
various student aid grant and loan programs, such as
TitleIV program funds. These funds are received subsequent
to the completion of the authorization and disbursement process
for the benefit of the student. The U.S.Department of
Education requires TitleIV program funds collected in
advance of student billings to be kept in separate cash or cash
equivalent accounts until the students are billed for that
portion of their program. The Company records these amounts as
restricted cash. On average, the majority of these funds remains
as restricted cash for a period between 60 and 90days from
date of receipt. Restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash
equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of
Cash Flows until the cash is transferred from these restricted
accounts to the Companys operating accounts. The
Companys restricted cash is primarily invested in
municipal bonds and U.S.government-sponsored enterprises
with maturities of 90days or less. Changes in restricted
cash are included in purchases and maturities of marketable
securities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   Marketable
Securities   Marketable securities consist of auction rate securities,
municipal bonds, U.S.government-sponsored enterprises, and
corporate obligations. The Company accounts for marketable
securities in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS115. Marketable
securities with a maturity date greater than one year are
considered noncurrent, while all other marketable securities are
considered current. The Company has the ability and intention to
hold its marketable securities, other than auction-rate
securities, until maturity and therefore classifies these
investments as
held-to-maturity,
reported at amortized cost. Auction-rate securities with auction
or reset dates prior to the maturity date of the underlying
security are classified as current and available for sale and
are reported at amortized cost, which approximates the estimated
market value. Interest and dividend income, including the
amortizations of the premium and discount, are included in
interest income and other, net in the Companys
Consolidated Statements of Income.   Property
and Equipment, net   Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Furniture, equipment, and software is depreciated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the related assets, which range from three to five years.
Leasehold improvements and tenant improvement allowances are
amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Construction in progress is recorded at cost until the
corresponding asset is placed into service and depreciation
begins. Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of seven to ten years.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.   The Company capitalizes certain internal software development
costs in accordance with Statement of Position SOP
98-1,
Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use. Such costs consist primarily of
the direct labor associated with building the internally
developed software. Capitalized costs are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated lives of the software,
not to exceed five years.

certain costs capitalized, certain costs expensed as incurred,
and the post-implementation/operation stage all costs expensed
as incurred. The costs capitalized in the application
development stage include the costs of designing the chosen
path, coding, installation of hardware, and testing. The Company
capitalizes costs incurred during the development phase of the
project as permitted.   Goodwill   Goodwill is primarily the result of the Companys
acquisition of CFP, which was acquired in September 1997.
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS142, addresses goodwill and
other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and
prescribes that these assets will not be amortized, but instead
tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if
circumstances arise indicating potential impairment. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit containing goodwill
exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit, an impairment
loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair
value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of
the goodwill. This pronouncement provides specific guidance on
performing impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangibles.   The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill
requires judgment. In assessing the fair value of the
Companys reporting units, the Company makes estimates
about the future cash flows of its reporting units. The
Companys cash flow forecast is based on assumptions that
are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using
to manage the underlying businesses. Other factors the Company
considers include, but are not limited to, significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected
future operating results, significant changes in the manner or
use of the acquired assets or the overall business strategy, and
significant negative industry or economic trends. If the
Companys estimates or related assumptions change in the
future, the Company may be required to record non-cash
impairment charges for these assets. In addition, the Company
makes certain judgments about allocating shared assets and
liabilities to the balance sheets for its reporting units. The
Company has engaged a third-party valuation expert to assist in
evaluating the fair values of its reporting units. The Company
has selected August31 as the date on which it performs its
annual goodwill impairment test.   As of August31, 2006, the Company concluded that the
goodwill for CFP was impaired in the amount of
$202million. This impairment was included in the
Companys Other Schools segment. In performing its annual
impairment test, the Company assessed the recoverability of the
goodwill by evaluating the future discounted cash flows and the
fair value of CFPs tangible and intangible assets. The
total discounted future cash flows was determined to be
significantly less than the Companys original expectations
due to
slower-than-forecasted
revenue growth. After the impairment charge, the remaining
goodwill totaled $169million, which represents
approximately 13% of total assets. There are no other
long-lived assets that the Company believes are impaired.
Additional impairments could affect future results of operations.   Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   In accordance with SFASNo144, Accounting for
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFAS144, the Company evaluates the carrying
amount of its major long-lived assets whenever changes in
circumstances or events indicate that the value of such assets
may not be fully recoverable. The Companys major
long-lived asset as of August31, 2006 is property and
equipment. The Company believes the carrying amounts are fully
recoverable and no impairment exists.   Insurance
Reserves   The Company records liabilities for claims and related expenses
that are estimable and probable related to its self-insured
medical and dental insurance programs in accordance with the
contractual terms of the insurance policies. Accounting for
insurance liabilities that are self-insured involves
uncertainty, because estimates and judgments are used to
determine the liability to be recorded for reported claims and
claims incurred but not reported. The Company considers its
historical experience in determining the appropriate insurance
reserves to record in the

Based Compensation   See also Note3, Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements, for the discussion of the
restatement related to the Companys stock option grants.   On September1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of
SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFAS123R. In March 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No107
SAB107 relating to SFAS123R, which
the Company applied in its adoption of SFAS123R.
SFAS123R requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation expense for all share based awards issued to
employees and directors, based on estimated fair values of the
share award on the date of grant. The Company adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS123R using the
modified prospective transition method, which requires
compensation expense to be recorded for all share based awards
granted after September1, 2005 and for all unvested stock
options outstanding as of September1, 2005. For all
unvested options outstanding as of September1, 2005, the
remaining unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair
value as determined under the provisions of SFAS123, will
be recognized as share based compensation in the Consolidated
Statements of Income over the remaining vesting period. For
share based awards granted subsequent to September1, 2005,
compensation expense is based on the fair value as determined
under the provisions of SFAS123R and will be recognized
in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting
period. Under the modified prospective transition method, prior
periods are not restated for the effect of SFAS123R.   SFAS123R requires the Company to calculate the fair
value of share based awards on the date of grant. The Company
uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
BSM to estimate fair value. The BSM requires the
Company to estimate key assumptions such as expected life,
volatility, risk-free interest rates and dividend yield to
determine the fair value of share based awards, based on both
historical information and management judgment regarding market
factors and trends. The Company amortizes the share based
compensation expense over the period that the awards are
expected to vest, net of estimated forfeiture rates. If the
actual forfeitures differ from management estimates, additional
adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future
periods.   Income
Taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and
liability method in accordance with SFASNo109,
Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS109. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
laws and tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date. Management
judgment is required in determining the provision for income
taxes and, in particular, whether or not a valuation allowance
should be recorded against the Companys deferred tax
assets.   Earnings
per Share   Earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with
SFASNo128, Earnings per Share
SFAS128. When one class of common stock is
convertible into another class of common stock, SFAS128
requires the use of the two-class method of computing earnings
per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation
formula that determines the earnings per share according to
participation rights in undistributed earnings. For the period
September1, 2003 through August27, 2004, the Company
presented basic and diluted earnings per share for Apollo Group
ClassA common stock and UPX Online common stock using the
two-class method. With

STATEMENTSContinued   respect to the Apollo Group ClassA and ClassB common
stock, dividends are payable at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, and the Articles of Incorporation treat the
declaration of dividends on the Apollo Group ClassA and
Apollo Group ClassB common stock in an identical manner as
follows: holders of the Companys Apollo Group ClassA
common stock and Apollo Group ClassB common stock are
entitled to receive cash dividends, if and to the extent
declared by the Board of Directors, payable to the holders of
either class or both classes of common stock in equal or unequal
per share amounts, at the discretion of the Board of Directors.   Basic earnings per share for Apollo Group ClassA common
stock for these periods was calculated by dividing Apollo Group
earnings including its retained interest in UPX Online
earnings by the weighted average number of shares of Apollo
Group ClassA and ClassB common stock outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share was calculated similarly, except that
it included the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of
options issuable under the Companys stock option plans,
exclusive of options granted with respect to UPX Online common
stock, where applicable.   For periods in which UPX Online common stock was outstanding,
basic earnings per share for UPX Online common stock for these
periods was calculated by dividing UPX Online earnings
excluding Apollo Groups retained interest in UPX Online
earnings by the weighted average number of shares of UPX Online
common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per share was
calculated similarly, except that it included the dilutive
effect of the assumed exercise of options with respect to UPX
Online common stock.   On August27, 2004, the UPX Online common stock was
converted to Apollo Group ClassA common stock. Beginning
on August28, 2004, and for the years ended August31,
2006 and 2005, the financial results of the Apollo Group
ClassA common stock reflect Apollos consolidated
operations. Basic earnings per share is calculated using the
weighted average number of Apollo Group ClassA and
ClassB common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income per share is calculated similarly except that it
includes the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of options
issuable under the Companys stock option plans.   Both basic and diluted weighted average shares have been
retroactively restated for stock splits effected in the form of
stock dividends. The amount of any tax benefit to be credited to
additional paid-in capital related to the exercise of options is
included when applying the treasury stock method to stock
options in the computation of earnings per share.   Leases   See also Note3, Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements, for the discussion of the
restatement related to the Companys leases.   The Company currently leases substantially all of its
administrative and educational facilities under operating lease
agreements. Most lease agreements contain renewal options,
tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays,
and/or rent
escalation clauses. In accordance with SFASNo13
Accounting for Leases SFAS13, in
instances where one or more of these items are included in a
lease agreement, the Company records a deferred rent asset or
liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and records the
rent expense evenly over the term of the lease. All tenant
improvement allowances that are spent on leasehold activities
are reflected under investing activities as additions to
property and equipment on the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows. Cash received for tenant improvement allowances are
reflected as a component of operating activities and credits
received against rent for tenant improvement allowances are
reflected as a component of non-cash investing activities on the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Lease terms generally
range from five to ten years with one to two renewal options for
extended terms. For leases with renewal options, the Company
records rent expense and amortizes the leasehold improvements on
a straight-line basis over the initial non-cancelable lease term
in instances where the lease term is shorter than the economic
life of the asset when the Company does not believe that the
renewal of the option is reasonably assured. The Company is also
required to make additional payments under operating lease terms
for taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses incurred
during the operating lease period. The Company also leases
facility space from time to time on a short-term basis in order
to provide specific courses or programs.

and Promotional Costs   Selling and promotional costs consist primarily of compensation
and employee benefits for enrollment counselors, management and
support staff, corporate marketing, advertising, production of
marketing materials, and other costs related to selling and
promotional functions. The Company expenses selling and
promotional costs as incurred.   Start-Up
Costs   Costs such as advertising, marketing, temporary services,
employee relocation, and supplies related to the
start-up of
new campuses and learning centers are expensed as incurred.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The financial position and results of operations for the
Companys foreign operations are measured using the local
currency as the functional currency. The assets and liabilities
of these operations are translated to U.S.dollars using
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and
expense items are translated at monthly average rates of
exchange. The resulting translation adjustments are included in
the component of Shareholders Equity designated as
accumulated other comprehensive income.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, certain
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these
financial instruments.   The related party receivable represents a promissory note due
from Dr.John G. Sperling, the founder and Acting Executive
Chairman of the Board, as described in Note9. The note was
executed on December14, 2001 in an arms-length transaction
and accrues interest at a fixed annual rate of six percent. The
carrying value of the related party receivable reasonably
approximates its fair value, as determined by applying
historical index adjusted interest rates to the outstanding
balance between the execution date and August31, 2006.   Loss
Contingencies   In accordance with SFASNo5, Accounting for
Contingencies SFAS5, when the Company
becomes aware of a claim or potential claim, the likelihood of
any loss or exposure is assessed. If it is probable that a loss
will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated, the Company records a liability for the loss. The
liability recorded includes probable and estimable legal costs
associated with the claim or potential claim. If the loss is not
probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably
estimated, the Company discloses the claim if the likelihood of
a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount is
material. For matters where no loss contingency is recorded, the
Companys policy is to expense legal fees as incurred.   Certain
Reclassifications   The Company revised the presentation of the consolidated
statements of cash flows to combine the purchase and maturities
of marketable securities with the changes in restricted cash,
including the purchase and maturity of restricted auction rate
securities.

STATEMENTSContinued   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   On September1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS123R,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense for all share based awards made to employees and
directors, based on estimated fair values of the share award on
the date of grant. SFAS123R supersedes the
Companys previous accounting under APB25 for periods
beginning in fiscal 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued
SAB107 which provided additional guidelines for
implementing SFAS123R. The Company has applied the
provisions of SAB107 in its adoption of SFAS123R.   In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a
replacement of APB Opinion No20 and FASB Statement
No3 SFAS154. SFAS154
requires retrospective application to prior periods
financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless
it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific
effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS154
also requires that retrospective application of a change in
accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the
change, which should be recognized in the period of the
accounting change. SFAS154 also requires that a change in
depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived,
nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
estimate effected by a change in accounting principle.
SFAS154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2005. Early adoption is permitted for
accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after the date this Statement was issued. The
Company adopted SFAS154 beginning in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2007. There was no impact upon adoption.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS157.
SFAS157 provides a single definition of fair value, along
with a framework for measuring it. It also requires additional
disclosure about using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. It is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim
periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
SFAS157 will have on its financial condition and results
of operations.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No115 SFAS159. Under SFAS159,
companies have an opportunity to use fair value measurements in
financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value. SFASNo159 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact SFAS159 will have on its financial
condition and results of operations.   In September 2006, the SEC released SABNo108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements SAB108, which addresses how
uncorrected errors in previous years should be considered when
quantifying errors in current-year financial statements.
SAB108 requires registrants to consider the effect of all
carry-over and reversing effects of prior-year misstatements
when quantifying errors in current-year financial statements.
SAB108 does not change the SEC staffs previous
guidance on evaluating the materiality of errors. It allows
registrants to record the effects of adopting SAB108
guidance as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
This adjustment must be reported in the annual financial
statements of the first fiscal year ending after
November15, 2006. The application of the provisions of
SAB108 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys financial condition and results of operations.   In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure.
FIN48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after

Restatement
of Consolidated Financial Statements   As a result of the errors discussed below, the Company has
restated its consolidated balance sheet as of August31,
2005, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows,
including related disclosures, for each of the fiscal years
ended August31, 2005 and 2004 the
Restatement.   Share
Based Compensation Expense Adjustment   With the completion of the Companys reviews discussed
below, the Company determined that errors had occurred in the
accounting for share based compensation. Specifically, the
Company determined that 57 of the 100 total grants made from
June 1994 to September 2006 used incorrect measurement dates for
accounting purposes. Of these 100 grants, 33 grants were issued
to the Companys management and other employees
Management Grants. The Company determined that
incorrect measurement dates were used for accounting purposes
for 24 of the 33 Management Grants. As a result, revised
measurement dates were selected for many grants and resulted in
exercise prices that were less than the fair market value of the
stock on the most likely measurement dates. The Company recorded
pre-tax compensation expense of $529million
$599million after-tax in the aggregate over the fiscal
years 1994 through 2005. The after-tax amount is higher due
primarily to disallowed deductions pursuant to Internal Revenue
Code IRC Section162m and related penalties
and interest. This incremental share based compensation expense
results in a cumulative decrease to pre-tax income of
$211million $342million after-tax for the years
ended August31, 2002 through 2005.   Independent
Review and Internal Review   In response to comments in a report published by an investment
bank on June8, 2006 that questioned whether the Company
might have backdated stock option grants during its fiscal years
ended August31, 2000 through August31, 2004, the
Board of Directors authorized a special committee the
Special Committee, on June23, 2006, to retain
independent legal counsel, who in turn retained forensic
accountants, to assist them in conducting an independent review
of the Companys historical practices related to stock
option grants the Independent Review. In November
2006, with the assistance of outside legal counsel, the Company
also began an in-depth internal review to ascertain the most
likely measurement date of every stock option grant since the
Companys initial public offering during its fiscal year
1994 through September 2006 the Internal Review.   The Special Committee presented its report of findings the
Special Committee Report to the Board of Directors
on December8, 2006, and the Company reported these
findings publicly on December15, 2006. The Special
Committees findings include, among other things, that many
of the stock option grants it reviewed were not accounted for in
accordance with GAAP and that the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting with respect to stock option
grants were inadequate.   Based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each grant,
management and the Special Committee concluded that during the
period from June 1994 through September 2006, the Company used
incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes. As a
result, revised measurement dates for many grants resulted in
exercise prices that were less than the fair market value of the
stock on the revised measurement dates.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   As part of its Internal Review, the Company adopted a
methodology for determining the most likely accounting
measurement dates for stock option grants in the following
categories: 1grants to management and other employees;
2grants to Section16 officers, except the Former
CEO the Section16 Grants; 3grants to
its Former CEO the Former CEO Grants;
4grants to employees upon hiring, promotion and other
special circumstances the Individual Grants;
5grants to non-employee Directors the Director
Grants; and 6grants to faculty employees the
Faculty Grants. The Company applied the following
hierarchy for determining the most likely measurement dates for
each category as follows   Management, Section16, Former CEO and Individual
Grants   1.The Company used the original stated grant date for any
grant where evidence of Compensation Committee or, after August
2002, Former CEO approval on the stated grant date exists and
the recipients and the numbers of stock options were final.   2.The Company used the original stated grant date for
Section16 and Former CEO Grants issued after August 2002
when Forms4 were filed within two days of the stated grant
date as long as there was not evidence that the grants were not
final and approved as of the stated grant date.   3.The Company used the Form4 filing date for the
Section16 and Former CEO grants issued after August 2002
when there was evidence that the grants were not final and
approved as of the stated grant date but were final and approved
by the date of the filing of the Form4.   4.For the majority of the grants, where the measurement
date was not determined by the criteria above, the Company
determined that the most likely measurement date was the date
the grant was entered into Equity Edge, the Companys stock
and option plan accounting software the Equity Edge
Record Added Date. This methodology was used when the
Company was unable to locate contemporaneous documentation
confirming that the stock option award terms were finalized and
approved on the stated grant date.   Director Grants   5.The Company used the original stated grant date for
Director Grants issued under the Director Stock Plan which
expired on August31, 2003. The Director Stock Plan was a
grant program pursuant to which option grants for a specific
number of shares were automatically made to the non-employee
Board members on a pre-established date each year. The Company
used the original stated grant date for Director Grants awarded
subsequent to August 2002 under the 2000 Incentive Stock Plan
when Forms4 were filed within two days of the stated grant
date.   Faculty Grants   6.The Company generally used the original grant date for
Faculty Grants since faculty employees received grants only when
the employee met the criteria set forth in the Companys
faculty handbook or website posting, which states the strike
price market value on the date of grant, number of shares to
be granted, and the date and frequency of the grant.   Income
Tax Related Matters
Section162m   In relation to the Restatement, certain tax deductions in prior
years with respect to compensation attributable to the exercise
of certain stock options by executive officers may be in
question. Under IRC Section162m, the amount of such
deduction per covered executive officer is limited to
$10million per year, except to the extent the
compensation qualifies as performance-based. Compensation
attributable to options with revised measurement dates may not
have qualified as performance-based compensation. Accordingly,
the Company may have claimed deductions with respect to those
exercised options that were in excess of the limit imposed under
IRC Section162m. As a result, the Company has accrued
its best estimate with respect to potential tax liabilities,
including interest and penalties for the taxable years 2003
through 2005 which are currently its only open years subject to   
91 Table of Contents   APOLLO
GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   adjustment for federal tax purposes, of approximately
$411million as of August31, 2006. These accruals
have been recorded because the Company believes it is more
likely than not that the deductions will be disallowed by the
IRS. For prior periods where a liability existed and where the
statute of limitations has expired, the accrual relating to that
period has been reversed in the appropriate period.   Restatement
Adjustments   1Share Based Compensation As
discussed above, the Company has restated its financial results
to record share based compensation expense.   2Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
During the year ended August31, 2006, the Company
concluded that a significant increase in its allowance for
doubtful accounts was required. A portion of the increase has
been determined to be the correction of an error from prior
periods and is included in the accompanying financial statements
as an element of the Restatement. This error related to the fact
that in prior years the Company did not properly consider
available information related to athe cumulative
differences between actual write-offs and its allowance for
doubtful accounts and bsignificant increases in the
Return to Lender dollars for TitleIV
recipients who withdraw from UPX or WIU. When a student with
TitleIV loans withdraws from UPX or WIU, the Company is
sometimes required to return a portion of TitleIV funds to
the lenders. The Company is generally entitled to collect these
funds from the students, but the collection of these receivables
is significantly lower than its collection of receivables from
students who remain in its educational programs. Accordingly,
the Company has restated its allowance for doubtful accounts for
all prior periods presented.   3Other Adjustments The Company
concluded that the accounting for various accounts such as cash,
revenue, property and equipment, lease accounting and other
investments was not properly recorded in accordance with GAAP.
Specifically, the impairment in a venture capital fund
investment should have been recorded in an earlier period; cash
related to scholarships, grants, and refunds should have been
classified as restricted cash and student deposits; different
assumptions should have been used in determining the fair value
of options; certain share based compensation was improperly
amortized amongst quarters; auction rate securities were
improperly classified as cash and cash equivalents in certain
periods; and certain revenue under tuition discount programs
were not properly recorded. Certain of these errors resulted in
adjustments to pre-tax expense shown in other adjustments in the
table below.   Adjustments to the Companys lease accounting resulted in a
net increase in expense of $26million and
$07million for the years ended August31, 2005 and
2004, respectively, and adjustments to the balance sheet of
$26million as of August31, 2005. Specifically, the
Company determined that the accounting for its tenant
improvement allowances was not in accordance with GAAP. As part
of the Restatement, the errors in the Companys accounting
for the tenant improvement allowances were corrected and certain
of its operating leases now have been properly accounted for as
capital leases. These adjustment amounts are included in Other
Adjustments in the table below.   4Tax Effect of Adjustments The tax
effect of the Restatement adjustments is shown below. The
adjustment of $594million to income taxes payable as of
August31, 2005 is comprised primarily of potential taxes
attributable to IRC Section162m and related penalties
and interest. Due to statute expirations in fiscal year 2006,
the amount accrued as of August31, 2006 for federal taxes
is $411million.

STATEMENTSContinued   Pro Forma
Share Based Compensation Expense   The footnotes to the Companys previously issued financial
statements for the years ended August31, 2005 and 2004,
disclosed pro forma net income in accordance with SFAS123.
This pro forma disclosure also included errors not related to
measurement date changes in the amount of $198million
$119million after tax and $1235million
$744million after tax for the fiscal years ended
August31, 2005 and August31, 2004, respectively.
These errors arose from the misapplication of SFAS123 to
the Companys UPX Online stock options which were converted
to APOL options. Specifically, the Companys footnote
disclosure understated pro forma net income because it
erroneously included deductions for pro forma share based
compensation based on the intrinsic value of the converted
options as computed under APB25 rather than the fair value
of the converted options as computed under SFAS123.   The following table presents the effects of the errors relating
to the revision of measurement dates on share based compensation
included in the determination of net income, for each of the
fiscal years preceding 2004 reported in the Companys pro
forma disclosures presented in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS123. There was no share based compensation expense as
previously reported under APB25 for the years presented

securities have an underlying component of long-term debt or
equity. Auction rate securities trade or mature on a shorter
term than the underlying debt or equity based on an auction bid
that resets the interest rate of the security. The auction or
reset dates occur at intervals that are generally between 7 and
90days of the purchase. These securities provide a higher
interest rate than similar securities and provide high liquidity
to otherwise longer-term investments. The Companys intent
is to invest in auction rate securities throughout the fiscal
year to maximize its yield, but to liquidate these securities
prior to quarterly or annual reporting dates. As of
August31, 2006 and 2005 the Company was unable to
liquidate all of its auction rate securities, as shown above.
Auction rate securities are classified as available for sale.
Subsequent to August31, 2006, all auction rate securities
have been liquidated.   Municipal Bonds:Municipal bonds represent
debt obligations issued by states, cities, counties, and other
governmental entities, which earn federally tax-exempt interest.
The Company has the ability and intention to hold municipal
bonds until maturity and therefore classifies these investments
as
held-to-maturity,
reported at amortized cost. Based on the nature of the
investments and the intent and ability to hold them to maturity,
the Company has not recorded an impairment as of August31,

temporary.   Marketable securities are exposed to various risks and rewards,
such as interest rate, market and credit risk. Due to these
risks and rewards associated with marketable security
investments, it is possible that changes in the values of these

and Hermes Onetouch, LLC Hermes formed Interactive
Distance Learning, Inc. IDL, a new corporation, to
acquire One Touch Systems, a provider of interactive distance
learning solutions. The Company contributed $108million
in October 1999 and $12million in December 1999, in
exchange for a 19% interest in IDL. The Company accounted for
its investment in IDL under the cost method. Hermes is owned by
Dr.John G. Sperling.   On December14, 2001, Hermes acquired the Companys
investment in IDL in exchange for a promissory note in the
principal amount of $119million, which represented the
related carrying value and approximated the related fair value
as of that date. The promissory note accrues interest at a fixed
annual rate of six percent and is due at the earlier of
December14, 2021 or nine months after Dr.John G.
Sperlings death. The promissory note is included in other
assets as a receivable from a related party in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of August31, 2006 and 2005.   Apollo

$170,000, $156,000, and $244,000 during the years ended
August31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, for services
rendered to Apollo International in connection with this
agreement.   The Netherlands:Effective October1,
2005, the Company acquired certain assets of Apollo
Internationals campus in The Netherlands for a nominal
amount. When the Company executed the acquisition on
October1, 2005, an independent appraisal was not
performed, but it was the Companys belief that the
purchase price approximated fair value.   Governmental
Advocates, Inc.   Effective July1, 1989, the Company entered into an
agreement with Governmental Advocates, Inc. to provide
consulting services to the Company with respect to matters
concerning legislation, regulations, public policy, electoral
politics, and any other topics of concern to it relating to
state government in the state of California. Hedy F. Govenar,

years with respect to compensation attributable to the exercise
of certain stock options by executive officers may be in
question. Under IRC Section162m, the amount of such
deduction per covered executive officer is limited to
$10million per year, except to the extent the
compensation qualifies as performance based. Compensation
attributable to options with revised measurements dates may not
have qualified as performance-based compensation. Accordingly,
the Company may have claimed deductions with respect to those
exercised options that were in excess of the limit imposed under
IRC Section162m. As a result, the Company has accrued
its best estimate with respect to potential tax liabilities,
including interest and penalties for the taxable years 2003
through 2005 which are currently its only open years subject to
adjustment for federal tax purposes of approximately
$411million as of August31, 2006. These accruals
have been recorded because the Company believes it is more
likely than not that the deductions will be disallowed by the
IRS. For prior periods where a liability existed and where the
statute of limitations has expired, the accrual relating to that
period has been reversed in the appropriate period.

Shareholders
Equity   Conversion
of UPX Online Stock Options and Common Stock   On March24, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors
authorized the issuance of a new class of stock called UPX
Online common stock, to reflect the separate performance of UPX
Online, a campus within UPX. The Companys other
institutions and its retained interest in UPX Online were
subsequently referred to as Apollo Group. On
October3, 2000, an offering of 5,750,000shares of
UPX Online common stock was completed at a price of
$1400per share.   The Companys Articles of Incorporation
Articles gave it the right, at any time, to
convert shares of UPX Online common stock to shares of Apollo
Group ClassA common stock. On August6, 2004, the
Companys Board of Directors authorized the conversion of
each share of UPX Online common stock to shares of Apollo Group
ClassA common stock effective August27, 2004. In
accordance with the terms of the Articles, each outstanding
share of UPX Online common stock was converted into
111527shares of Apollo Group ClassA common stock as
of August27, 2004. The conversion ratio was based upon the
relative market values of Apollo Group ClassA common stock
and UPX Online common stock averaged over the 20 trading days
July9, 2004 through August5, 2004ending five
trading days prior to August12, 2004, the announcement
date, and included a 10% premium on the value of UPX Online
common stock, all as required by the terms of the Articles. The
conversion resulted in the issuance of approximately
166million new shares of Apollo Group ClassA common
stock. In addition, each unexercised option to purchase UPX
Online common stock as of August27, 2004, was converted to
10766 options to purchase Apollo Group ClassA common
stock. The conversion ratio was based upon the relative market
values of Apollo Group ClassA common stock and UPX Online
common stock at the close of the market on August12, 2004,
prior to the announcement. As a result of the conversion of UPX
Online common stock to Apollo Group ClassA common stock,
the Company no longer reports separate financial statements for
UPX Online.   The conversion of UPX Online common stock required the Company
to adjust net income attributable to Apollo Group ClassA
common stock and UPX Online common stock by the premium paid to
convert outstanding shares of UPX Online common stock to Apollo
Group ClassA common stock and to record a share based
compensation charge related to the conversion of UPX Online
stock options into Apollo Group ClassA stock options.   As required by SFAS128, the Company reduced income
attributable to Apollo Group ClassA common stock in the
fourth quarter of 2004 by $1142million related to the
non-cash 10% premium paid to redeem the UPX Online common stock,
as this premium is considered a benefit that constitutes an
additional contractual return to UPX Online shareholders. The
amount of the reduction to income attributable to Apollo Group
ClassA common stock was calculated based on the number of
UPX Online common stock shares outstanding and converted on
August27, 2004. This non-cash premium is included on the
Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity
and in the reconciliation of income attributable to Apollo Group
ClassA common stock on the Consolidated Statements of

Stock Purchase Plan   The Companys Third Amended and Restated 1994 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan allows the Companys employees to
purchase shares of Apollo Group ClassA common stock at
quarterly intervals through periodic payroll deductions at a
price per share equal to 95% of the fair market value on the
purchase date. Prior to the amendment and restatement of the
Purchase Plan on October1, 2005, the Apollo Group, Inc.
Second Amended and Restated 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
allowed the Companys employees to purchase shares of the
Companys Apollo Group ClassA common stock and,
during the period it was outstanding, UPX Online common stock,
at a purchase price per share, in general, that was 85% of the

Based Compensation Plans   See also Note3, Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements, for the discussion of the
restatement related to the Companys stock option grants.   The Company has three share based compensation plans: the Apollo
Group, Inc. Second Amended and Restated Director Stock Plan
DSP, the LTIP and the 2SIP.   The DSP provided for an annual grant to the Companys
non-employee directors of options to purchase shares of the
Companys Apollo Group ClassA common stock on
September1 of each year through 2003. No additional
options are available for issuance under this plan.   Under the LTIP, the Company may grant non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, and other share based awards
in the Companys Apollo Group ClassA common stock to
certain officers, key employees, or directors of the Company.
Most of the options granted under the LTIP vest 25%per
year over four years. The vesting may be accelerated for certain
grants if certain operational goals are met.   Under the 2SIP, the Company may grant non-qualified stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and
other share based awards in the Companys Apollo Group
ClassA common stock to certain officers, key employees, or
directors of the Company. Prior to the conversion of UPX Online
common stock to Apollo Group ClassA common stock, the
Company had the ability to also grant non-qualified stock
options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and
other share based awards in UPX Online common stock. Any
unexercised UPX Online common stock options outstanding as of
August27, 2004, were converted to options to purchase
Apollo Group ClassA common stock. Most of the options
granted under the 2SIP vest 25%per year over four years.
The vesting may be accelerated for certain grants if certain
operational goals are met.   Under all of the above Plans, the stock option price may not be
less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of grant. Options are granted for terms of up to ten
years and can vest over periods from six months up to four
years. The requisite service period for all options is equal to
the vesting period. Under the Plans currently in effect the
LTIP and 2SIP, the Company is authorized to grant up to
308million shares of common stock under these Plans. As
of August31, 2006, approximately 28million
authorized and unissued shares of common stock are reserved for
issuance under the LTIP and the 2SIP.

00     00     00     The weighted average estimated grant date fair value, as defined
by SFAS123R, for options granted under the
Companys stock option plan during the year ended
August31, 2006 was $2606per share.   Expected Volatility The Company uses an
average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility
of long-lived call options to estimate expected volatility
consistent with SFAS123R and SAB107. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS123R, the Company had used an estimate
based on its historical volatility for purposes of its pro forma
disclosure.   Expected Life years Beginning on
September1, 2005, the expected life was determined taking
into account both the contractual term of the option and the
effects of employees expected exercise. Where applicable,
the expected life has been determined using the simplified
method pursuant to SAB107. Prior to September1,
2005, the expected life was determined based on an analysis of
historical exercise behavior and management judgment.   Risk-Free Interest Rate The Company uses the
U.S.constant maturity treasury rates as the risk-free rate
interpolated between the years commensurate with the expected
life assumptions.   Dividend Yield The dividend yield assumption
is based on the fact that the Company has not historically paid
dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the future.   Forfeitures Forfeitures are estimated at the
time of grant based on historical forfeiture activity adjusted
for any known nonrecurring activity. If necessary, management
estimates are trued up at the end of each vesting period if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.   Expected Vesting Period The Company amortizes
the share based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, over
the expected vesting period using the accelerated recognition
method for pre-September1, 2005 grants and the
straight-line method for awards with only service conditions and
the accelerated recognition method for awards with performance
conditions for post-September1, 2005 grants in accordance
with SFAS123R.   Pro

Commitments
and Contingencies   The Company is subject to various claims and contingencies in
the ordinary course of business, including those related to
regulation, litigation, business transactions, employee related
matters and taxes, among others. While the outcomes of these
matters are uncertain, management does not expect that the
ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial
positions, results of operations or cash flows.   Guarantees   The Company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors
for certain events or occurrences. The maximum potential amount
of future payments the Company could be required to make under
these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the
Company has a director and officer liability insurance policies
that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of
any future amounts paid. As a result of its insurance policy
coverage, management believes the estimated fair value of these
indemnification agreements is minimal.

$1148million for the years ended August31, 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively.   The Company has entered into five separate sale-leaseback
agreements with unrelated third parties. These agreements were
related to property located throughout Phoenix, Arizona, which
the Company currently uses to support its operations. The
property is subject to ten year lease terms expiring between
2010 and 2014. In total the Company received approximately
$462million in cash for the property, which generated a
combined gain of approximately $175million that is being
deferred over the respective lease terms. The Company recognized
total gains in its income statement of $15million,
$17million and $09million in 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The balance of the total deferred gain was
$123million as of August31, 2006 and
$138million as of August31, 2005 and is included in
long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   Letter
of Credit   As of August31, 2006, an unsecured letter of credit for
WIU in the amount of $53million is outstanding. The
letter of credit expired in March 2007.   Sale
Lease Back Option   On June20, 2006, the Company entered into an option
agreement which was amended in November 2006with
Macquarie Riverpoint AZ, LLC Macquarie. The option
agreement allows the Company to execute a sale and simultaneous
leaseback of the new corporate headquarters buildings located in
Phoenix, Arizona. The Company anticipates beginning to occupy
this building late in fiscal year 2007 and finishing
construction by the end of the third quarter of 2008. In the
third quarter of 2008, the Company anticipates executing the
sale lease-back option. When the sale-leaseback option is
exercised, the Company anticipates receiving approximately
$170million in cash for the building and land, and expects
to generate a gain on the sale of approximately
$20-30million. The gain will be deferred over the
12-year term
of the lease agreement.   Internal
Revenue Service Audit   On September13, 2006, the Internal Revenue Service
IRS commenced an audit of the Companys
U.S.federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended
August31, 2003 through 2005 for income and deductions
previously claimed by the Company, including deductions claimed
under IRC Section162m. In relation to the Restatement,
certain tax deductions in prior years with respect to
compensation attributable to the exercise of certain stock
options by executive officers may be in question. Under IRC
Section162m, the amount of such deduction per covered
executive officer is limited to $10million per year,
except to the extent the compensation   
116 Table of Contents   APOLLO
GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   qualifies as performance-based. Compensation attributable to
options with revised measurement dates may not have qualified as
performance-based compensation. Accordingly, the Company may
have claimed deductions with respect to those exercised options
that were in excess of the limit imposed under IRC
Section162m. As a result, the Company has accrued its
best estimate with respect to potential tax liabilities,
including interest and penalties for the taxable years 2003
through 2005 which are currently its only open years subject to
adjustment for federal tax purposes, of approximately
$411million as of August31, 2006. These accruals
have been recorded because the Company believes it is more
likely than not that the deductions will be disallowed by the
IRS. For prior periods where a liability existed and where the
statute of limitations has expired, the accrual relating to that
period has been reversed in the appropriate period. In addition,
the IRS audit may result in additional tax, penalties and
interest, the amount of which may or may not be material, but
this will not be known until the IRS audit is complete. The
Company does not anticipate that the IRS audit will be complete
prior to the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, and it may
extend past such quarter, depending on the issues raised by the
IRS with respect to such years.   Income
Tax Related Matters Section409A   The revised measurement dates for certain stock options
discussed above may result in adverse tax consequences to
holders of those options under IRC Section409A.
Section409A was enacted in 2004 to impose certain
restrictions on deferred compensation arrangements, including
limitations on the subsequent distribution of deferred amounts.
Deferred compensation for this purpose is defined very broadly
and, as a result, includes in that definition, options granted
at a discounted exercise price, to the extent those options vest
after December31, 2004 409A Affected
Options. Therefore, the revised measurement dates for the
options discussed above could subject the options that vest
after calendar year 2004 to treatment as 409A Affected Options.
Each holder of a 409A Affected Option would recognize taxable
income on the option spread at the time of vesting or, for 409A
Affected Options exercised in calendar years 2006 or 2007, at
the time of exercise and would incur, in addition to regular
income taxes, an additional 20% penalty tax on such spread and
interest. Similar penalty taxes could apply under state tax
laws. We are subject to certain reporting and withholding
obligations with respect to the taxable income on the option
spread.   1Unexercised 409A Affected Options   Section16 Officers:In December 2006,
the Company entered into irrevocable written agreements with
each of its Section16 Officers and certain Former
Section16 Officers, holding 409A Affected Options pursuant
to which those options were to be brought into compliance with
Section409A, and thereby would avoid the adverse tax
consequences summarized above, through either of the following
alternatives: aamendment of the option to increase the
exercise price to the market price per share of the
Companys ClassA common stock on the revised
measurement date or bthe optionees commitment to
exercise the option to the extent in the money during the 2007
calendar year prior to its contractual expiration date.
Generally, these amendments will be treated as a modification of
the option under SFAS123R. However, in this
circumstance, there are no accounting consequences under
SFAS123R.   Non-Section16 Officers:An offer to
amend the 409A Affected Options held by non-Section16
Officers to increase the exercise price to the market price per
share of the underlying ClassA common stock on the revised
measurement date cannot be made until after this Annual Report
on
Form10-K
and all other delinquent filings are filed with the SEC. In
order to avoid adverse taxation under Section409A, this
amendment must be made on or before the earlier of
iDecember31, 2007 or iithe exercise of the
409A Affected Options during the 2007 calendar year. The Company
anticipates that it will commence such an offer after the filing
of this Annual Report on
Form10-K
and all other delinquent filings.   As part of the offer and amendment process under IRC
Section409A, the Company may provide bonuses to the
holders of the amended options to compensate them for the
resulting increase in their stock option exercise price.
However, the Company has not yet made a decision to implement a
bonus program to compensate either the Section16 Officers
or the non-Section16 Officers resulting from the increased
exercise prices. A decision to   
117 Table of Contents   APOLLO
GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   compensate for increased prices through a bonus would represent
a modification to the grant and would result in accounting
consequences under SFAS123R.   2Exercised 409A Affected Options   In February 2007, the Company elected to participate in a
program announced by the Internal Revenue Service in Notice
2007-30,
which pertains to 409A Affected Options exercised by
non-Section16 Officers during the calendar year 2006 and
which allows the Company to pay the penalty tax and interest due
to the related measurement date changes that would otherwise be
payable by the option holders who exercised the 409A Affected
Options. The payment of the tax penalty and interest on behalf
of the option holders in 2007 will result in additional taxable
income to the option holders. As such, the Company will pay on
behalf of or reimburse the option holders for applicable payroll
and income taxes related to the additional income, as well as
provide a gross up for any tax consequences of the penalty tax
and interest reimbursement it makes. The Company recorded a
pre-tax liability in the second quarter of 2007 for compensation
expense under this program totaling approximately
$26million.   Contingencies

a qui tam action, as it has done in this case, the relators may
elect to pursue the litigation on behalf of the federal
government and, if they are successful, receive a portion of the
federal governments recovery. The qui tam action alleges,
among other things, violations of the False Claims Act,
31U.S.C. 3729a1 and 2, by UPX for
submission of a knowingly false or fraudulent claim for payment
or approval, and knowingly false records or statements to get a
false or fraudulent claim paid or approved in connection with
federal student aid programs, and asserts that UPX improperly
compensates its employees; on or about October20, 2003, a
motion to dismiss the action was filed and was subsequently
granted with leave to amend the complaint. Subsequently, a
second amended complaint was filed on or about March3,
2004. A motion to dismiss this amended complaint was filed on or
about March22, 2004, and the case was subsequently
dismissed with prejudice. On June11, 2004, an appeal was
filed with the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
On September5, 2006, the Ninth Circuit reversed the ruling
of the district court and held that the relators had adequately
alleged the elements of a False Claims Act cause of action. On
January22, 2007, UPX filed a Petition for Writ of
Certiorari with the U.S.Supreme Court; on April23,
2007, the U.S.Supreme Court denied UPXs petition. As
a result, the case has been remanded to the District Court in
accordance with the order of the Ninth Circuit. In addition, on
March23, 2007, UPX filed a motion in the District Court to
dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the September7,
2004 settlement agreement between UPX and the
U.S.Department of Education constituted an alternate
remedy under the False Claims Act. In addition, the Company has
filed a Motion to Dismiss based on the availability of an
alternative remedy; this Motion is currently pending. Discovery
has not yet commenced in the District Court. While the outcome
of this legal proceeding is uncertain, management does not
expect a material adverse effect on the Companys business,
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows to
result from this action. In addition, the Company cannot
reasonably estimate a reserve for this action and accordingly
has not accrued any liability associated with this action.

Teresa Qui Tam Action   On July27, 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the
U.S.Department of Education, Office of the Inspector
General, requiring that the Company produce documents relating
to enrollment and financial aid activities at the Santa Teresa
campus during the period January1, 2000 to August31,
2004. Subsequently, an Assistant U.S.Attorney informed the
Company that the subpoena was part of an investigation being
conducted by the government for the purpose of determining
whether or not the government would intervene in a qui tam
lawsuit. On August23, 2006, the DOJ filed a Notice of
Election to Decline Intervention in this qui tam lawsuit, which
had been filed in the U.S.District Court for the Western
District of Texas. On or about December8, 2006, the
relators in this qui tam lawsuit served the Company with the
complaint. On January29, 2007, the relators filed a Motion
to Dismiss Without Prejudice to the United States, which
requested that the court dismiss the action with prejudice as to
the relators but without prejudice as to the United States. The
United States consented to the dismissal without prejudice as to
the United States. On February2, 2007, the court granted
the relators motion. This action has not had and will not
have a material adverse effect on the Companys business,
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.   Axia Qui
Tam Action   On August15, 2005, a relator filed a qui tam complaint
under seal in the U.S.District Court for the District of
Columbia. On April12, 2006, the DOJ filed The
Governments Notice of Election to Decline Intervention in
this qui tam lawsuit and on June15, 2006, the court
entered an order unsealing the complaint. An amended complaint
was served on or about November1, 2006. On
November15, 2006, the relator filed a Voluntary Notice of
Dismissal. On November17, 2006, the court ordered that the
relator comply with the statutory requirements for dismissal of
a qui tam False Claims Act action by December1, 2006. On
December1, 2006, the United States consented to the
dismissal of the action with prejudice as to the relator, so
long as the dismissal is without prejudice as to the United
States. On February2, 2007, the court ordered the United
States to articulate its reasons for consenting to the dismissal
of the action. On February21, 2007, the United States
filed a Statement of Reasons for Consenting to Dismissal. While
the outcome of this legal proceeding is uncertain, management
does not expect a material adverse effect on the Companys
business, financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows to result from this action. In addition, the Company
cannot reasonably estimate a reserve for this action and
accordingly has not accrued any liability associated with this
action.   Sanders
ClassAction   On approximately September26, 2003, a class action
complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of
California for the County of Orange, captioned Bryan Sanders
etalv. University of Phoenix, Inc. etal,
Case No03CC00430. Plaintiff, a former academic advisor
with UPX, filed this class action on behalf of himself and
current and former academic advisors employed by the Company in
the State of California and seeks certification as a class,
monetary damages in unspecified amounts and injunctive relief.
Plaintiff alleges that during his employment, he and other
academic advisors worked in excess of eight hours per day or
40hours per week, and contends that the Company failed to
pay overtime. On June6, 2005, the court granted
plaintiffs motion to remove Bryan Sanders as the named
plaintiff and replace him with Deryl Clark and Romero Ontiveros.
Plaintiffs counsel has advised defendants and the court
that Mr.Ontiveros no longer intends to serve as a named
plaintiff. Five status conferences have occurred and the parties
are now in the process of discovery. The court granted
defendants motion to transfer venue to the Superior Court
of the State of California for the County of Solano.
Plaintiffs motion to certify the class was continued by
the court and scheduled for a hearing in August 2006. A motion
for summary judgment was filed on May15, 2006, on behalf
of UPX and Apollo Group, Inc. On August23, 2006, the court
issued an order and denied Clarks motion to certify the
class. On October24, 2006, the court granted UPXs
and Apollo Groups motion for summary judgment. In November
2006, Clark agreed not to appeal the courts ruling in
exchange for a waiver of costs. This action has not had and will
not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
business, financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

LOA. The court consolidated the three pending class action

on May16, 2005 by the lead plaintiff. Lead plaintiff
purports to represent a class of the Companys shareholders
who acquired their shares between February27, 2004 and
September14, 2004, and seeks monetary damages in
unspecified amounts. Lead plaintiff alleges violations of
Sections10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and
Rule10b-5
promulgated under the Act by the Company for their issuance of
allegedly materially false and misleading statements in
connection with their failure to publicly disclose the contents
of the U.S.Department of Educations program review
report. A motion to dismiss the consolidated class action
complaint was filed on June15, 2005, on behalf of Apollo
Group, Inc. and the individual named defendants. The court
denied the motion to dismiss on October18, 2005 and
discovery commenced. The parties conducted discovery from
October 2005 until discovery closed on February16, 2007.
On March9, 2007, both parties filed motions for summary
judgment. Opposition briefs were filed on May11, 2007, and
reply briefs are due to be filed no later than June8,
2007. The summary judgment motions are scheduled to be heard on
September4, 2007. The case remains set for trial on
November14, 2007. While the outcome of this legal
proceeding is uncertain, management does not expect a material
adverse effect on the Companys business, financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows to result from
this action. In addition, the Company cannot reasonably estimate
a reserve for this action and accordingly has not accrued any
liability associated with this action.   Alaska
Electrical Pension FundDerivative Action   Three shareholder derivative suits are pending in the
U.S.District Court for the District of Arizona, alleging
on behalf of the Company that certain of the Companys
current and former officers and directors engaged in misconduct
regarding stock option grants. As with any derivative action, an
independent committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
will need to determine whether it is in the Companys best
interest to itself pursue the allegations made on behalf of the
Company. These derivative complaints were filed on or around
September 5 and19, 2006 and November11, 2006 after
the Company announced the formation of the Special Committee and
the commencement of its investigation, and the Company has moved
the Court to stay these actions pending the conclusion of the
Special Committees investigation and review of
plaintiffs claims. On December4, 2006, the Court
issued an order in the case captioned Alaska Electrical
Pension Fundv. Sperling, Case
No.CV06-02124-PHX-ROS,
stating that the Companys motion to stay the proceedings
would be granted upon notice that Hedy F. Govenar had been
replaced on the Special Committee by another board member who
was not a party to the case. Effective December8, 2006, K.
Sue Redman has replaced Ms. Govenar as a member of the Special
Committee. As of March13, 2007, James R. Reis joined the
Special Committee in place of Daniel D. Diethelm. Now that the
Special Committee has concluded its factual findings, the
Special Committee has been charged to analyze, in light of the
investigation, whether the pursuit of these shareholder
derivative cases would be in the Companys best interest.
While the outcome of this legal proceeding is uncertain,
management does not expect a material adverse effect on the
Companys business, financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows to result from this action. In
addition, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a reserve for
this action and accordingly has not accrued any liability
associated with this action.

Complaint on December8, 2006, denying the material

Derivative Action   On April24, 2006, Larry Barnett filed a complaint
derivatively on behalf of the Company. The lawsuit was filed in
the Superior Court for the State of Arizona, Maricopa County and
is entitled Barnettv. John Blair etal, Case
Number CV2006-051558. On October10, 2006, plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint adding allegations of stock option
backdating. The complaint names as defendants the Company, John
M. Blair, Dino J. DeConcini, Hedy F. Govenar, Kenda Gonzales,
Todd Nelson, Laura Palmer Noone, John Norton, John G. Sperling
and Peter V. Sperling. The First Amended Complaint alleges,
among other things, that the individual defendants breached
their fiduciary duties to the Company and that certain of the
individual defendants were unjustly enriched by their receipt of
backdated stock option grants. The plaintiff seeks, among other
things, an award of unspecified damages and reasonable costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees. On August21,
2006, the Company filed a Motion to Stay the case arguing that
it is not in the best interests of the Company to prosecute
plaintiffs purported derivative claims prior to resolution
of the parallel federal securities class action pending against
the Company in federal district court as described below under
Teamsters Local Union Putative ClassAction.
The individual defendants joined in the Motion to Stay. On
November10, 2006, after plaintiff filed the First Amended
Complaint and added allegations of stock option backdating, the
Company filed an Amended Motion to Stay arguing that the action
should be stayed pending resolution of the federal securities
class action and pending the Special Committees
investigation into the allegations of stock option backdating.
Also on November10, 2006, the Company filed a motion to
sever the claims relating to stock option backdating from the
claims made in the original complaint. On January29, 2007,
the Court granted the Amended Motion to Stay for a period of six
months. The Court set an interim case management conference for
June4, 2007. While the outcome of this legal proceeding is
uncertain, management does not expect a material adverse effect
on the Companys business, financial position, results of

addition, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a reserve for
this action and accordingly has not accrued any liability

complaint seeks damages sustained by Apollo and UPX as a result
of breaches of fiduciary duty, abuse of control and waste of

Local Union Putative ClassAction   On November2, 2006, a plaintiff filed a class action
complaint purporting to represent a class of shareholders who
purchased the Companys stock between November28,
2001 and October28, 2006. The complaint alleges that the
Company and certain of its current and former directors and
officers violated Sections10b and 20a and
Rule10b-5
promulgated thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by
purportedly failing to disclose alleged deficiencies in the
Companys stock option granting policies and practices.
Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages and other relief. On
January3, 2007, other shareholders, through their separate
attorneys, filed motions seeking appointment as lead plaintiff
and approval of their designated counsel as lead counsel to
pursue this action. Those motions are pending before the court.
The Company has not yet responded to the complaint in this
action, but intends to vigorously oppose plaintiffs
allegations. While the outcome of this legal proceeding is

and Other Legal Matters   U.S.Department
of Education Audits   From time to time as part of the normal course of business, UPX
and WIU are subject to periodic program reviews and audits by
regulating bodies. The U.S.Department of Education, OIG,
conducted an audit of UPX for the period September1, 2002,
through March31, 2004. On August24, 2005, the OIG
issued a final audit report whereby the OIG concluded that UPX
had policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurances
that the institution properly makes initial and subsequent
disbursements to students enrolled in TitleIV eligible
programs and issued certain recommendations. On
September27, 2006, the U.S.Department of Education
issued a final audit determination letter regarding disbursing
TitleIV funds to student accounts for allowable
institutional charges and disbursing funds to students who were
not in eligible programs. UPX has complied with the final audit
determination letter.   On December22, 2005, the OIG issued a separate audit
report on their review of UPXs policies and procedures for
the calculation and return of TitleIV funds. The OIG
concluded that UPX had policies and procedures that provide
reasonable assurances that it properly identified withdrawn
students, appropriately determined whether a return of
TitleIV funds was required, returned TitleIV funds
for withdrawn students in a timely manner and used appropriate
methodologies for most aspects of calculating the return of
TitleIV funds. The OIG did conclude, however, that UPX did
not use appropriate methodologies for calculating the percentage
of TitleIV financial aid earned from March1, 2004
through December7, 2004. Since December8, 2004, UPX
has adopted the methodologies deemed appropriate by the
U.S.Department of Education. The U.S.Department of
Education will ultimately issue a final audit determination
letter regarding the return of TitleIV funds. UPX has
accrued $37million, which is its best estimate of the
refund liability. While the outcome of the OIG audit proceedings
are on-going, management does not expect a material adverse
effect on the Companys business, financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows to result from these
actions.

Nasdaq Staff Determination letters, dated July11, 2006,
November14, 2006, January11, 2007 and April11,
2007, respectively, stating that the Company was not in
compliance with the filing requirements of Marketplace
Rule4310c14 and, therefore, that the Companys
stock was subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select
Market. The Company appealed this determination, requested a
hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel the
Panel and attended the hearing at which the Company
sought appropriate exceptions to the filing requirements from
the Panel, pending completion of its delinquent reports. On
September20, 2006, the Panel granted the Companys
request for continued listing of its securities on the Nasdaq
Global Select Market, subject to the condition that the Company
files this Report and its Quarterly Reports on
Form10-Q
for the quarters ended May31, 2006 and November30,
2006 on or before December29, 2006. On December14,

to file its delinquent reports by December29, 2006 and
sought a reasonable extension of that date. On December20,
2006, the Panel denied the Companys request and notified
the Company that it had determined to suspend trading of the
Companys securities on December29, 2006. The Company
appealed this determination, and on December22, 2006, the
Company was informed by the Listing Council that it had
determined to call the Panels Delisting Decision for
review, as contemplated by Marketplace Rule4807b, and
had also stayed the delisting of the Companys securities
pending further review of the Listing Council. The Company
submitted additional information for the Listing Councils
consideration on February2, 2007. On March29, 2007,
the Panel determined to exercise its discretionary authority,
under Rule4802b, to grant the Company an exception to
demonstrate compliance with all of the Nasdaq Global Select

With the filing of this Report and its Quarterly Reports on

Segment
Reporting   The Company operates exclusively in the educational industry
providing higher education. The Companys five operating
segments are aggregated into three reportable segments for
financial reporting purposes: UPX, Other Schools, and Corporate.
The Other Schools segment includes IPD, WIU, and CFP. The UPX

operations. The Companys operations are also subject to a
similar regulatory environment, which includes licensing and
accreditation.   Consistent with SFASNo131, Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
SFAS131, the Companys reportable
segments have been determined based on the method by which
management evaluates performance and allocates resources.
Management evaluates performance based on reportable segment

Quarterly
Results of Operations Restated and Unaudited   Seasonality   The Companys operations are generally subject to seasonal
trends. The Company experiences, and expects to continue to
experience, seasonal fluctuations in the results of operations
as a result of changes in the level of student enrollments.
While the Company enrolls students throughout the year, second
quarter December through February enrollments and related
revenues generally are lower than other quarters due to holiday
breaks in December and January. The Company experiences a
seasonal increase in new enrollments in August of each year when
most other colleges and universities begin their fall semesters.   Quarterly

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   of Mr.Diethelm. With their resignations, Mr.Blair
and Ms.Govenar no longer serve on the Nominating and
Governance Committee, effective immediately after the Company
files its Annual Report on
Form10-K
for the fiscal year ended August31, 2006 and its other
delinquent reports.   Changes
in Management   On September25, 2006, Dr.William J. Pepicello was
promoted to President, University of Phoenix. On
November1, 2006, Ms.Kenda B. Gonzales resigned as
Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company.
Ms.Gonzales was replaced by Mr.Joseph L.
DAmico who was appointed Chief Financial Officer on
November14, 2006. On November5, 2006,
Mr.Daniel E. Bachus resigned as Chief Accounting Officer
and Controller of the Company and was replaced by Mr.Brian
L. Swartz, who was engaged effective December15, 2006 and
appointed Vice President, Corporate Controller, and Chief
Accounting Officer on February6, 2007. On March31,
2007, Mr.Gregory W. Cappelli entered into an employment
contract with the Company and was appointed Executive Vice
President, Global Strategy and Assistant to the Executive
Chairman. Under the terms of his employment agreement,
Mr.Cappelli will be granted 1,000,000 options subject to
an Equalization Grant, as defined to purchase shares in the
Companys ClassA common stock and $5million in
restricted stock units.   Stock
Option Plans   On January12, 2007, the Companys Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors approved a resolution to
modify the terms of the stock option grants for approximately 50
individuals. These modifications allowed employees, including
officers, terminated on or after November3, 2006 to
exercise their options beyond the normal 90day
post-termination period provided under the 2SIP and their option
agreements thereunder. The Company extended the exercise periods
of these options because the Company was unable, during the
financial statement restatement process, to sell shares of its
Class A common stock to such individuals in compliance with the
applicable registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. Absent the extension, the options would have
expired prior to the employee having the opportunity to
exercise, since the 90 day post-termination exercise period
would have expired prior to the Company completing its financial
statement restatement process.   As a result of these modifications, the Company recorded a
non-cash charge to share based compensation of
$121million during the second quarter of 2007. In
addition, the modified awards held by employees who terminated
prior to the January12, 2007 modification are subject to
the provisions of EITF Issue
No00-19,
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed
to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys Own Stock
EITF00-19.
Of the $121million in expense recognized upon
modification of the awards, $118million related to awards
subject to the provisions of
EITF00-19,
under which, these awards are classified as liabilities and
reported in Current portion of Long-Term Liabilities in the
Companys consolidated balance sheets.
EITF00-19
also requires the Company to report the awards classified as
liabilities at their fair value as of each balance sheet date.
Any increase or decrease in this fair value is recorded in
general and administrative expense in the Companys
consolidated statements of income. During the second quarter of
2007, the Company recorded an additional expense of
$28million as a result of the increase in the fair value
of the awards to $146million as of February28,
2007. The exercise prices of the approximately 475,000 options
subject to
EITF00-19
range between $650 and $7123.   On May15, 2007, holders of the Companys Class B
common stock increased the number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 2SIP by 50million shares.   Tax

Controls and Procedures   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   The Company intends to maintain disclosure controls and
procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to
management, including its President Principal Executive
Officer and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.   Management, under the supervision and with the participation of
its President Principal Executive Officer and CFO, evaluated
the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e
or 15d-15e
promulgated under the Act, as of the end of the period covered
by this report. Based on that evaluation, management concluded
that, as of that date, the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance
level because of the identification of material weaknesses in
its internal control over financial reporting, which the Company
views as an integral part of its disclosure controls and
procedures.   Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on
Form10-K
are certifications of the Companys President Principal
Executive Officer and CFO, which are required in accordance
with
Rule13a-14
of the Act. This Disclosure Controls and Procedures section
includes information concerning managements evaluation of
disclosure control and procedures referred to in those
certifications and, as such, should be read in conjunction with
the certifications of the Companys President Principal
Executive Officer and CFO.   Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting of the
Company. Managements intent is to design this system to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in the United
States of America.   The Companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that   ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company   iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the
Company;and   iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination
of significant deficiencies, that results in there being a more
than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the
annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected. Management performed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of August31, 2006, utilizing the
criteria described in the Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
objective of this assessment was to determine whether the
Companys internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of August31, 2006. In its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2006, management determined that there were
control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as
described below.   
140 Table of Contents   
i
Control
Activities Relating to Stock Option Grants   The Company did not maintain effective controls over its
granting of stock options and the related recording and
disclosure of share based compensation expense under
APB25, SFAS123, SFAS123R and their related
interpretations. Specifically, effective controls, including
monitoring, were not designed and in place to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the existence, completeness, accuracy,
valuation and presentation of activity related to the
Companys granting of stock options in the financial
statements. These control deficiencies resulted in errors in
ishare based compensation expense, additional paid-in
capital, related income tax accounts and weighted averaged
diluted shares outstanding and iirelated financial
statement disclosures that resulted in the restatement of the
Companys historical financial statements. Accordingly,
management determined that in the aggregate these control
deficiencies constitute a material weakness in internal control
over financial reporting.   iiControl
Activities Relating to Accounting for the Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts   The Company did not maintain effective controls over its
accounting for bad debt expense and the related allowance for
doubtful accounts. Specifically, the Company did not properly
consider all available historical information as well as current
trends in estimating its required bad debt reserve. This control
deficiency resulted in errors in bad debt expense and the
allowance for doubtful accounts, and related income tax accounts
which resulted in a restatement of the Companys historical
financial statements for 2004 through 2006. Accordingly,
management determined that this control deficiency constituted a
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.   iiiControl
Activities Relating to the Valuation of Goodwill   The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
valuation of goodwill. Specifically, the Company did not
adequately review, analyze and test assumptions provided to its
third-party appraiser and the related valuation in accordance
with SFAS142. This control deficiency resulted in errors
in goodwill and impairment expense that resulted in an
adjustment to the Companys previously released earnings on
October18, 2006 for the fourth quarter of 2006.
Accordingly, management determined that this control deficiency
constituted a material weakness in internal control over
financial reporting.   ivControl
Activities Relating to Accounting for Tax Liability Under IRC
Section162m   The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
implementation, documentation and the administration of its
share based compensation plans. In relation to the Restatement,
certain tax deductions in prior years with respect to
compensation attributable to the exercise of certain stock
options by executive officers may be in question. Under IRC
Section162m, the amount of such deduction per covered
executive officer is limited to $10million per year,
except to the extent the compensation qualifies as
performance-based. Compensation attributable to options with
revised measurements dates may not have qualified as
performance-based compensation. Accordingly, the Company may
have claimed deductions with respect to those exercised options
that were in excess of the limit imposed under IRC
Section162m. As a result, the Company has accrued its
best estimate with respect to potential tax liabilities,
including interest and penalties for the taxable years 2003
through 2005 which are currently its only open years subject to
adjustment for federal tax purposes, of approximately
$411million as of August31, 2006. These accruals
have been recorded because the Company believes it is more
likely than not that the deductions will be disallowed by the
IRS. For prior periods where a liability existed and where the
statute of limitations has expired, the accrual relating to that
period has been reversed in the appropriate period. Accordingly,
management determined that the control deficiency constituted a
material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.   Based on this assessment, and because of the material weaknesses
described above, management has concluded that internal control
over financial reporting was not effective as of August31,
2006.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting has
been audited by Deloitte Touche, LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein.   
141 Table of Contents   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There have not been any changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
August31, 2006, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys
internal control over financial reporting.   Remediation
of Material Weaknesses   Management is committed to remediating the control deficiencies
that constitute the material weaknesses described above by
implementing changes to the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. For its stock option grants, management has
implemented or has plans to implement all of the improvements in
internal control over financial reporting suggested as a result
of the Independent Review and Internal Review into stock option
granting practices. Management plans to continue to implement
further changes and improvements during the remainder of the
current fiscal year. In addition, management has established
procedures to consider the ongoing effectiveness of both the
design and operation of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting.   As mentioned above, the Company has implemented a number of
significant changes and improvements in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting during the first and
second quarters of fiscal year 2007. The President and CFO of
the Company have taken the responsibility to implement changes
and improvements in the Companys internal control over
financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that
gave rise to the material weaknesses. Specifically, these
changes include   Management   
The Company engaged its new Chief Financial Officer on

procedures and controls.   
The members of the Compensation Committee completely changed in
2007. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee resigned from
the Board, and the Board appointed a new Chairman of the
Compensation Committee who had not been previously involved in

options until the Company is in compliance with its periodic
reporting requirements under the Act, as amended, and retained

grants to be made within a designated period following the
release of financial results for the prior fiscal quarter or

documentation required for ithe granting, exercise and
cancellation of all equity-based compensation awards,

reviews and reconciliations related to equity-based compensation
award activity, allowance for doubtful accounts activity and the
valuation of goodwill. The CFO
and/or the
CAO will specifically review and approve each of these
calculations.   
Employees previously involved in key roles or the decision
making process for each of the material weaknesses are no longer
involved in the process.   
The Company has retained third-party stock option software
administration professionals to assist with the understanding of
the Companys stock option administration software and to
train its employees that are involved in the stock option
administration process.   
The Companys Internal Audit reporting line has been
clarified such that the Director of Internal Audit reports
directly to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee.   
143 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   Apollo Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries   Phoenix, Arizona   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Apollo Group, Inc. and subsidiaries
the Company did not maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting as of August31, 2006,
because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified in
managements assessment based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.   A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or combination
of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment: 1The Company did not
maintain effective controls over its granting of stock options
and the related recording and disclosure of share based
compensation expense under APB25, SFAS123 and
SFAS123R and their related Interpretations.
Specifically, effective controls, including monitoring, were not
designed and in place to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the existence, completeness, accuracy, valuation and
presentation of activity related to the Companys granting
of stock options in the financial statements. These control
deficiencies resulted in errors in ishare based
compensation expense, additional paid-in capital, related income
tax accounts and weighted averaged diluted shares outstanding
and iirelated financial statement disclosures that
resulted in the restatement of the Companys historical
financial statements; 2The Company did not maintain
effective controls over its accounting for bad debt expense and
the related allowance for doubtful accounts. Specifically, the
Company   
144 Table of Contents   did not properly consider all available historical information
as well as current trends in estimating its required bad debt
reserve. This control deficiency resulted in errors in bad debt
expense and the related allowance for doubtful accounts and
related income tax accounts which resulted in a restatement of
the Companys historical financial statements for 2004
through 2006; 3The Company did not maintain effective
controls over the valuation of goodwill. Specifically, the
Company did not adequately review, analyze and test assumptions
provided to its third-party appraiser and the related valuation
in accordance with SFAS142. This control deficiency
resulted in errors in goodwill and impairment expense that
resulted in an adjustment to the Companys previously
released earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006; and
4The Company did not maintain effective controls over
the implementation, documentation and the administration of its
share based compensation plans. Specifically, the Company
claimed deductions with respect to compensation attributable to
the exercise of certain stock options, which may not qualify as
performance- based compensation under Internal Revenue Code of
1986 IRC Section162m. As a result of this
control deficiency, the Company may have claimed deductions with
respect to those exercised options which were in excess of the
limit imposed under IRC Section162m. This control
deficiency resulted in errors to the Companys potential
tax liabilities, including interest and penalties for the
taxable years 2003 through 2005. These material weaknesses were
considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of
audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial
statements as of and for the year ended August31, 2006, of
the Company and this report does not affect our report on such
financial statements.   In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of August31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the
material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of August31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
August31, 2006, of the Company and our report dated
May21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph
regarding the Companys adoption of a new accounting
standard.   DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP   Phoenix, Arizona   May21, 2007

Section16a
Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance   Section16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
requires our directors and executive officers, as well as
persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our
equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of
ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership.
Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders
are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all
Section16a forms they file. Based solely upon a review
of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written
representations that no Forms5 were   
150 Table of Contents   required, we believe that during the fiscal year ended
August31, 2006, our directors and officers complied with
all Section16a filing requirements except as set forth
below. During the fiscal year ended August31, 2006, the
following individuals failed to timely file a Form4:
Dr.John G. Sperling, Peter V. Sperling and Todd S. Nelson,
each for a disposition of shares.   Code of
Ethical Conduct   We have adopted a code of ethical conduct that applies to all
employees, including our directors, executive officers, and all
members of our finance department, including the principal
financial officer and principal accounting officer. This code of
ethical conduct is available on the Companys website at
In the event that the Company makes any amendment to, or grants
any waiver from, a provision of the Code of Ethical Conduct that
applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer, principal accounting officer, controller or certain
other senior officers and requires disclosure under applicable
SEC rules, we intend to disclose such amendment or waiver and
the reasons for the amendment or waiver on our website,
http www.apollogrp.edu and, as required by Nasdaq, file a
Current Report on
Form8-K
with the SEC reporting the amendment or waiver.   Controlled
Company   We are a Controlled Company as defined in
Rule4350c of the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC, since more than 50% of the voting power of Apollo
Group is held by the John Sperling Voting Stock Trust. As a
consequence, we are exempt from certain requirements of
Marketplace Rule4350, including that aour Board be
composed of a majority of Independent Directors as defined in
Marketplace Rule4200, bthe compensation of our
officers be determined by a majority of the independent
directors or a compensation committee composed solely of
independent directors and cnominations to the Board of
Directors be made by a majority of the independent directors or
a nominations committee comprised solely of independent
directors. However, Marketplace Rule4350c does require
that our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings
at which only independent directors are present executive
sessions and IRC Section162m does require a
compensation committee of outside directors within the meaning
of Section162m to approve stock option grants to
executive officers in order for us to be able to deduct the
stock option grants as an expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing
exemptions, we do have a majority of independent directors on
our Board of Directors and we do have a Compensation Committee
and a Nominating and Governance Committee composed of
independent directors.   Revised charters for the Compensation, Audit and Nominating and
Governance Committees have been approved by the Board of
Directors. These charters provide, among other items, that each
member must be independent as such term is defined by the
applicable rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC and the SEC.
