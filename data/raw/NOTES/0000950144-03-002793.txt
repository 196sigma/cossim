SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts Note1.Background Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. is
headquartered in the United States of America United
States or U.S., and together with its
subsidiaries SWM or the Company is a
diversified producer of premium specialty papers and the
worlds largest supplier of fine papers to the tobacco
industry. The Companys principal products include
cigarette, tipping and plug wrap papers used to wrap various
parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco leaf for use as
filler in cigarettes, reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders
for cigars and paper products used in cigarette packaging. The
Company was formed as a result of a tax-free spin-off from
Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kimberly-Clark on
November30, 1995. As used herein, the Company means SWM,
SWM and its several subsidiaries or, as determined by the
context, one or more or its several subsidiaries. Note2.Significant
Accounting Policies Basis
of Presentation These financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities reported, disclosure of contingencies at
the date of the financial statements and amounts of revenues and
expenses reported for the periods. Actual results could differ
from these estimates. These financial statements are presented on a
consolidated basis and include the accounts of SWM and all its
majority-owned subsidiaries. The Companys wholly-owned
direct subsidiaries are Schweitzer-Mauduit Canada, Inc.
SM-Canada and Schweitzer-Mauduit Spain, S.L.
SM-Spain, a holding company organized under the
Spanish holding company regime and the primary foreign
investment holding company for SWM, and together SWM and
SM-Canada wholly-own Schweitzer-Mauduit International China,
Limited, a currently inactive holding company incorporated in
Hong Kong. The Company indirectly through SM-Spain has
subsidiaries in France and Brazil. SM-Spain owns directly
100percent of Schweitzer-Mauduit France S.A.R.L., a French
corporation SMF, 72percent of the issued and
outstanding shares of LTR Industries S.A., a French corporation
LTRI, and 100percent of Schweitzer-Mauduit
Holding S.A.R.L., a French corporation SMH, which
in turn owns 100percent of Schweitzer-Mauduit Industries
S.A.R.L., a French corporation SMI. SMH and SMI
are currently inactive holding companies. SMF, directly or
indirectly, owns 100percent of three principal French
operating subsidiaries, Papeteries de Mauduit S.A.S.
PdM, Papeteries de Malaucne S.A.S.
PdMal and Papeteries de Saint-Girons S.A.S.
PdStG. SM-Spain also owns directly 9999 percent
of the issued and outstanding shares of Schweitzer-Mauduit do
Brasil S.A., a Brazilian corporation SWM-B. All
material intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.
The Company does not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries, joint
ventures or special purpose entities. Revenue
Recognition Sales are recognized when ownership of the
product and all risk of loss are transferred to the customer.
Deferred revenue represents advance payments from customers
which are earned based upon a mutually agreed-upon amount per
unit of future product sales. Foreign
Currency Translation The income statements of foreign entities are
translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates
prevailing during the periods. The balance sheets of these
entities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the
differences from historical exchange rates are reflected in a
separate component of accumulated other 42 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts comprehensive income lossas unrealized
foreign currency translation adjustments. Foreign currency gains
and losses arising from settlement of transactions in non-local
currencies and remeasurement of non-local currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income,
net. Earnings
Per Share Basic net income per common share is computed
based on net income divided by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. The average number of common shares
outstanding used in the calculation of basic net income per
common share for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 14,853,500, 14,777,200
and 15,224,100, respectively. Diluted net income per common
share is computed based on net income divided by the weighted
average number of common and potential common shares
outstanding. The average number of common and potential common
shares outstanding used in the calculation of diluted net income
per common share for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 15,242,600,
15,038,300 and 15,272,400, respectively. Potential common shares
are those related to stock options, restricted stock outstanding
and directors accumulated deferred stock compensation
during the respective years. See Note 8 for a reconciliation of
the average number of common shares outstanding used in the
calculation of basic net income per share to the average number
of common and potential common shares outstanding used in the
calculation of diluted net income per common share. Cash
and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash, time
deposits and readily marketable securities with original
maturities of three months or less. The recorded amount reported
in the balance sheet approximates fair value. Inventories Most U.S. inventories are valued at cost on the
Last-In, First-Out LIFO method. The balance of the
U.S. inventories and inventories of entities outside the United
States are valued at the lower of cost, using the First-In,
First-Out FIFO and weighted average methods, or
market. Property
and Depreciation Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciable property is depreciated on the straight-line method
for accounting purposes. When property is sold or retired, the
cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the
transaction is included in income. The depreciable lives for the
principal asset categories are as follows   
Asset Category
Depreciable Life   
Machinery and Equipment
5 to 20years
Buildings
20 to 40years
Building Improvements
Lesser of 20years or remaining life of the
relevant building or lease
Capitalized
Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain purchases of
software and software design and installation costs in
connection with major projects of software development for
internal use. These costs are included in Deferred Charges and
Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized
on the straight-line method for accounting purposes over the
estimated useful life not to exceed seven years. The balances of
unamortized capitalized software costs on the Companys
consolidated balance sheet were $96 and $105 as of 43 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user
training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance are
expensed as incurred. Environmental
Spending Environmental spending is capitalized if such
spending qualifies as property, plant and equipment,
substantially increases the economic value or extends the useful
life of an asset. All other such spending is expensed as
incurred, including fines and penalties incurred in connection
with environmental violations. Environmental spending relating
to an existing condition caused by past operations is expensed.
Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments or
remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with
completion of a feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan
of action. Impairment
of Assets The Company periodically assesses the likelihood
of recovering the cost of long-lived assets based on its
expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow
of the related operations. These factors, along with
managements plans with respect to the operations, are
considered in assessing the recoverability of property and
purchased intangibles. Income
Taxes Income tax expense and deferred income tax assets
and liabilities are determined under the asset and liability
method. Deferred income taxes have been provided on the
differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates in effect
for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. In France, SMF and its subsidiaries form a
consolidated income tax group, while LTRI separately files its
own income tax returns. Stock
Compensation Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation defines a fair value based method of
accounting for stock compensation, including stock options, to
employees. This statement provides entities a choice of
recognizing related compensation expense by adopting the fair
value method or to measure compensation using the intrinsic
value method under Accounting Principles Bulletin
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. The Company has elected to continue to
measure compensation cost for stock compensation based on the
intrinsic value method under APB No25. Payments in the
form of shares of the Company made to third parties, including
the Companys outside directors, are recorded at fair value
based on the market value of the Companys common stock at
the time of payment. Under APB No25, because the exercise
price of the Companys employee stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized. SFAS No123, as
amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure,
requires presentation of pro forma net income and earnings per
share as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock
compensation under the fair value method of that statement. For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of the stock 44 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share

The valuation under SFAS No123 was based
on the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the market value
of the stock equal to the exercise price, an estimated
volatility over the ten year option term of 32percent for
the 2002 awards, 33percent for the 2001 awards and
30percent for the 2000 awards, a risk-free rate of return
based upon the zero coupon government bond yield and an assumed
quarterly dividend of $015 per share. Derivative
Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities Effective January1, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS
No138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. The statement
requires that all derivative financial instruments, whether
designated in hedging relationships or not, be recognized as
either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.
If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the
changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current
period earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow
hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income loss
and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item
affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments or that do not qualify for
hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of a
particular derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a
hedge, must be recognized currently in the income statement. The Company selectively hedges its interest rate
and foreign currency exposures when it is practicable and
cost-effective to do so. The Company uses derivative instruments
only for risk management purposes and not for trading or
speculation. All derivative instruments used by the Company are
either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial
institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of
nonperformance by third parties. The Company also enters into
contracts with certain customers and vendors in which prices for
the Companys normal sales and purchases may be fixed for
periods of time, or may have automatic price adjustment features
related to changes in costs of raw materials or other
components. Based on the terms of these contracts, which provide
for sale or purchase of items, other than a financial instrument
or derivative instrument, that will result in physical delivery
of such items in quantities expected to be sold or used by the
Company over a reasonable period in the normal course of
business, such contracts are deemed to meet the normal purchases
and normal sales exceptions of SFAS No133 and, therefore,
are neither considered to be nor accounted for as derivative
financial instruments. The Companys only outstanding derivative
financial instruments designated as hedges as of January1,
2001, were foreign currency forward rate contracts, with fair
values approximately equal to their carrying value. As a result,
the Company recorded no cumulative effect of adopting
SFAS133. During the first quarter 45 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts of 2001, the Company entered into interest rate
swap agreements to fix the variable rate component of certain of
its variable rate long-term debt see Note5. There were
no other new derivative contract agreements entered into by the
Company during 2001 or 2002 other than foreign currency forward
rate contracts which are summarized in Note9. New
Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS No141,
Business Combinations and SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS
No141 required that the purchase method of accounting be
used for all business combinations initiated after June30,
2001 and eliminated the pooling-of-interests method of
accounting. SFAS No142 changed the accounting for
goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only
approach. Thus, amortization of goodwill, including goodwill
recorded in past business combinations, ceased upon adoption of
SFAS No142. The Company adopted SFAS No142
effective January1, 2002. The adoption of these new
accounting standards had no material effect on the
Companys financial statements. Also in June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, which addressed financial accounting and
reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. The statement is effective for the Companys
financial statements for the period beginning January1,
2003. The Company expects no material effect on its financial
statements as a result of this new accounting standard. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. Although SFAS No144 superseded
SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of, it retained most of the concepts of that standard,
except that it eliminated the requirement to allocate goodwill
to long-lived assets for impairment testing purposes and it
required that a long-lived asset to be abandoned or exchanged
for a similar asset be considered held and used until it is
disposed, i.e. the depreciable life should be revised until the
asset is actually abandoned or exchanged. Also, the new standard
included the basic provisions of APB No30,
Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting
the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, for presentation of discontinued operations
in the income statement but broadened that presentation to
include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a
business, where that component can be clearly distinguished from
the rest of the entity. The Company adopted SFAS No144
effective January1, 2002. The adoption of this new
accounting standard had no material effect on the Companys
financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities, which is effective for such activities
initiated after December31, 2002. SFAS No146 bases
accrual of an exit or disposal cost on the existence of a
liability that constitutes an obligation as defined
in FASB Concept Statement No6, Elements of
Financial Statements, which is different from the concept
of an expected cost that was the underpinning of Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. SFAS No146, which is effective for
the Company beginning January1, 2003, will be used to
establish the timing of recognition of costs in connection with
exit or disposal activities, if any, initiated after
December31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which
amends SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation to provide alternative methods of transition
for companies that voluntarily elect to adopt the fair value
recognition and measurement methodology prescribed by SFAS
No123. Regardless of the method with which a company
elects to account for stock-based compensation arrangements, all

SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts required to provide certain disclosures in both
interim and annual financial statements regarding the method the
company uses to account for its stock-based compensation
arrangements and the effect of such method on the companys
reported results. The new disclosure requirements are effective
for the Company beginning in 2002 See Stock
Compensation above. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No45 FIN45, which
requires footnote disclosure of the guarantee or indemnification
agreements a company issues. With certain exceptions, such
agreements will also require prospective recognition of an
initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the
obligations assumed under that guarantee. The initial
recognition and measurement provisions of FIN45 are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December31, 2002. The Company adopted the
disclosure requirements of FIN45 effective with this
Annual Report on Form10-K as required. The Company expects
no material effect on its financial statements as a result of
this new accounting interpretation. Note3.Restructuring
Charge In 2001, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of
$51related to changes in business conditions of the
Companys Brazilian business and the resulting decision to
exit the printing and writing uncoated papers market in Brazil
and shut down one of its paper machines and associated
equipment. Non-cash write-downs of equipment represented $41 of
the pre-tax charge. The balance of the charge was primarily for
employee termination and severance costs and write-downs of
related spare parts and machine clothing. Substantially all of
the costs were incurred by December31, 2001, leaving less
than $01 of reserve as of that date. The remaining costs were
incurred during 2002 with no reserve remaining at
December31, 2002. Note4.Supplemental

Note5.Debt As of December31, 2001, the Company had an
unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which provided
term and revolving loans totaling 572million euros or
approximately $51 at December31, 2001 to SMF and PdM
Industries S.N.C., a subsidiary owned 99percent by PdM and
one percent by SMF, and term and revolving loans totaling $60 to
the Company. The French credit facilities included in the credit
agreement consisted of a term loan to SMF in the amount of 381
million euros or approximately $34 at December31, 2001
and a 364-day revolving credit facility available to both SMF
and PdM Industries in an amount of up to 191million euros
or approximately $17 at December31, 2001. The U.S.
credit facilities included in the credit agreement consisted of
a term loan to the Company in the amount of $45 and a renewable
364-day revolving credit facility available to the Company in an
amount of up to $15. Loans under the term loan 48 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts facilities were scheduled for payment in three
equal semi-annual installments on January31, 2002,
July31, 2002 and January31, 2003, however the
Company refinanced the credit agreement effective
January31, 2002. Effective January31, 2002, the Company
repaid the full amounts outstanding under its prior credit
agreement which consisted of U.S. and French term loan
facilities Term Loans of $45 and 381million
euros, respectively and entered into a new unsecured credit
facility with a group of banks Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement included five-year revolving loan
facilities totaling up to $45 and 50million euros and
364-day revolving loan facilities, originally totaling up to $15
and 20million euros. Under the Credit Agreement, on
January31, 2002, the Company borrowed $30 utilizing the
five-year U.S. dollar revolver and 15million euros under
the five-year euro revolver. Through December31, 2002, the
Company repaid 15 million euros and $10 under the five-year euro
and U.S. dollar revolvers, respectively, leaving no outstanding
balance under the five-year euro revolver and a balance of $20
as of December31, 2002 under the five-year U.S. dollar
revolver. While such plans may change, the Company does not
currently plan to repay the outstanding balance under the
five-year U.S. dollar revolver prior to the January31,
2007 maturity date. The terms of the Credit Agreement were similar to
the prior credit agreement, except that it iprovided for
five-year revolving loans in place of the Term Loans, which
gives the Company the flexibility to utilize cash balances to
pay down the five-year revolving loans and subsequently draw on
those facilities again when needed, iiprovided somewhat
higher available amounts for euro borrowings,
iiiextended the maturities of the five-year revolvers,
thus requiring no principal payments until maturity on
January31, 2007, provided the Company does not violate its
covenants under the Credit Agreement, and ivoriginally
renewed the Companys 364-day revolving loan facilities to
January30, 2003. In January 2003, the Company renewed its
364-day revolving loan facilities to January29, 2004 with
reduced amounts available to the Company. The 364-day U.S.
dollar revolving loan facility was reduced from $15 to $10, and
the 364-day euro revolving loan facility was reduced from 20
million euros to 12 million euros. As a result of the Credit Agreement, and
considering the reduced amounts available under the 364-day
revolving loan facilities effective January30, 2003, SMF
has five-year and 364-day revolving loan facilities available
totaling up to 62million euros or approximately $65 using
the December31, 2002 currency exchange rate the
Euro Credit Facility and the Company has five-year
and 364-day revolving loan facilities available totaling up to
$55 the U.S. Credit Facility and, together with the
Euro Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities. The
Euro Credit Facility consists of a five-year revolving credit
facility available to SMF in the amount of up to 50million
euros or approximately $525 using the December31, 2002
currency exchange rate the Five-Year Euro
Revolver and a renewable 364-day revolving credit
facility available to SMF in an amount of up to 12million
euros or approximately $125 using the December31, 2002
currency exchange rate the 364-Day Euro Revolver.
Borrowings by SMF under the Euro Credit Facility are guaranteed
by the Company. The Company also has the ability to borrow under
the Euro Credit Facility although it does not currently
anticipate doing so. The U.S. Credit Facility consists of a
five-year revolving credit facility to the Company in the amount
of up to $45 the Five-Year U.S. Revolver, and,
together with the Five-Year Euro Revolver, the Five-Year
Revolvers and a renewable 364-day revolving credit
facility available to the Company in an amount of up to $10 the
364-Day U.S. Revolver and, together with the 364-Day
Euro Revolver, the 364-Day Revolvers. As of December31, 2001, the Company
included a $15 scheduled installment of its U.S. term loan
facility in Current Portion of Long-Term Debt on its
consolidated balance sheet, with the $30 remainder classified as
Long-Term Debt, since the remainder was subsequently refinanced
under the Credit Agreement. As of December31, 2001, the
Company classified the first two scheduled installments of the
French term loan facility totaling 254million euros
approximately $226 using the December31, 2001 currency
exchange rate in Current Portion of Long-Term Debt on its
consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with the terms of the
existing French term loan facility, with the remaining

installment classified as Long-Term Debt, since the remainder
was subsequently refinanced under the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, the interest rate
under the Five-Year U.S. Revolver is the sum of aeither
070percent per annum or 080percent per annum the
Applicable Margin, determined by reference to the
Companys Net Debt to Equity Ratio as defined in the
Credit Agreement plus bthe London interbank offered
rate for U.S. dollar deposits LIBOR. Under the
Credit Agreement, the interest rate under the Five-Year Euro
Revolver is the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the euro zone
interbank offered rate for euro deposits EURIBOR.
The interest rates under the U.S. and Euro 364-Day Revolvers are
determined using the same formula for the respective Five-Year
Revolvers except that the Applicable Margin is either
065percent per annum or 075percent per annum,
determined by reference to the Companys Net Debt to Equity
Ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains representations and
warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and
covenants and provisions that, among other things, require the
Company maintain certain defined financial ratios a minimum
Tangible Net Worth, a maximum Net Debt to Equity Ratio and a
maximum Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, all as defined in the
Credit Agreement. At December31, 2002, the Companys
Tangible Net Worth was approximately $40 above the minimum
permitted amount while Net Debt was approximately $116 less than
the maximum permitted amount under the most restrictive
covenant. The Company does not currently anticipate any change
in business conditions of a nature that would cause the Company
to violate its covenants under the Credit Agreement. The Company selectively enters into interest rate
hedge agreements with respect to its variable rate long-term
borrowings under its credit facilities to manage its exposure to
interest rate increases when it is practicable and
cost-effective to do so. During the first quarter of 2001, the
Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the
variable rate component of certain of its variable rate
long-term debt. The combination of these interest rate swap
agreements began with a notional amount of $45, declining to $30
effective January31, 2002, and declining again to $15
effective July31, 2002 through the remainder of the
contract terms ending January31, 2003. These interest rate
swap agreements fixed the London interbank offered rate for U.S.
dollar deposits at 542percent. This had the effect of
fixing the Companys interest rate including margin at
572percent on $45 of its debt through January31,
2002, the effective date of the new Credit Agreement,
612percent on $30 of its debt from February1, 2002
through July31, 2002, and 612 percent on $15 of its debt
from August1, 2002 through January31, 2003. These
interest rate swap contracts were designated as cash flow hedges
and the Company applied the short-cut method treatment under
SFAS No133. As such, the Company assumed there was no
ineffectiveness of these hedge contracts, and accordingly, no
gain or loss was recorded in the income statement relative to
the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts,
but instead the changes in fair value of the contracts were
reflected in other comprehensive income loss. The fair value
balances were $02 and $11 as of December31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, and were included in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, net of tax, on the Companys
consolidated balance sheet. There were no other interest
rate-related derivative contract agreements entered into by the
Company during 2001 or 2002. The weighted average effective
interest rates on the Companys long-term credit agreement
facilities the Companys Five-Year Revolvers, and Term
Loan Facilities for the periods prior to January31, 2002
were 53percent, 54percent and 57percent for
the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Effective January31, 2003, the Company
entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement to fix the
LIBOR rate component of $15 of its variable rate U.S. dollar
long-term debt at 205percent, which had the effect of
fixing the Companys interest rate, including margin, at
275percent on $15 of its debt through January31,

The Companys effective income tax rate in
2002 compared with 2001 was impacted by a decrease in the French
corporate income tax rate from 363percent for 2001 to
353percent for 2002 and net favorable deferred income tax
adjustments of $16. The deferred income tax adjustments were
recorded primarily as a 52 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts result of changes in the Companys
expectations as to the realization of certain of these tax
assets due to the results of recent income tax audits in foreign
jurisdictions and changes in the Companys estimates of
future taxable income in each taxing jurisdiction. These changes
resulted in a net reduction in valuation allowances related to
deferred income tax assets. Excluding this net favorable income
tax adjustment of $16, the effective income tax rate for 2002
would have been 337percent which was lower than 2001 due
to the reduction in the French corporate income tax rate and due
to decreased profitability in the United States which has the
Companys highest corporate income tax rate and increased
profitability in Brazil which has the Companys lowest
corporate income tax rate. During 2002, the United States Internal Revenue
Service IRS conducted a review of the
Companys U.S. federal income tax returns for the years
1996 through 1998. No adjustments were proposed by the IRS
auditors as a result of their review. Additionally, French tax
authorities are in the process of auditing the Companys
consolidated French tax group for the years 1990 through 2000,
including companies formerly part of that tax group prior to the
Companys 1995 spin-off from Kimberly-Clark. The French tax
authorities have completed their work at most entities while
work at other entities is still to be completed. As a result of
the work conducted to date, the Company has received certain
assessments and notifications of findings, to which the Company
has responded to the French tax authorities. The Company
believes that any resulting adjustments related to the remaining
audit work by the French tax authorities will not be material. The Companys provision for income taxes in
2001 compared with 2000 was impacted by a decrease in the French
statutory corporate income tax rate from 377percent for
2000 to 363percent for 2001, which had been enacted in
December 2000. The effect of the changes in the French corporate
income tax rate enacted in 2000 had a nominal favorable effect
on the deferred income tax provision in 2000 related to the net
balances of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. The
provision for income taxes in 2000 was impacted by several
items, including a $10 favorable adjustment to reduce Spanish
deferred income tax valuation allowances, a favorable $04 tax
benefit related to settlement of a prior-period claim and $08
of income tax benefits associated with treatment of certain
repatriations during the year. Excluding the effects of these
three items, the effective income tax rate for 2000 would have
been 361percent. Further affecting the comparison was a
decrease in profitability in Brazil which has the Companys
lowest corporate income tax rate. The Company considers the undistributed earnings
of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or
plans to repatriate such earnings only when tax-effective to do
so. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income
taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings
in the form of dividends, loans to the U.S. parent, or
otherwise, the Company could be subject to both U.S. income
taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and
withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax
liability is not practicable because of the complexities
associated with its hypothetical calculation. 53 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

December31, 1994 by SMF subsidiaries unrelated to the
businesses distributed to the Company, which were distributed to
Kimberly-Clark prior to the spin-off, were retained by SMF as of
January1, 1995. In addition to SMFs remaining NOLs,
NOLs were obtained in the acquisition of the predecessor of

Under current tax laws governing the tax
jurisdictions in which the Company has NOLs, remaining NOLs in
France carry forward indefinitely and NOLs in Spain expire the
later of ten years subsequent to the year generated or ten years
subsequent to the first year of taxable income in Spain which
was 2000. NOL carryforwards in Brazil were fully utilized
during 2002. Of the $670 of NOLs still available at
December31, 2002, $49 and $08 will expire in 2010 and
2012, respectively, if not utilized against taxable income in
Spain. The remaining $613 of NOLs in France have no expiration
date. Valuation allowances related to NOLs totaled $82 as of
December31, 2002, reducing the related net deferred tax
asset to an amount which is estimated to be realizable through
utilization of the NOLs. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax asset will be realized. However, that amount could
change if, among other considerations, estimates of future
taxable income or income tax regulations or interpretations
change during the carryforward periods. In addition to the NOLs above, the Company has
generated foreign tax credits in excess of the amount of foreign
tax credits utilized in its U.S.federal income tax
returns, as well as federal research credits, certain state
credits, primarily for investments in fixed assets in those
states, and federal alternative minimum tax AMT
credits. The amount of cumulative excess foreign tax credits,
including an estimate of credits expected to be utilized in 2002
against incremental tax liabilities as a result of cash
repatriations, totaled $51 at December31, 2002. These
credits carry forward five years from the date generated,
however, because the Company does not currently foresee being
able to realize a financial benefit from these credits prior to
their expiration, the assets were fully reserved at
December31, 2002 with a valuation allowance of $51. The
federal research credits and various state tax credits are
estimated to total $23 as of December31, 2002, of which
the Company has estimated that $08 of these credits will be
realized prior to their expiration and thus has a valuation
allowance of $15 at December31, 2002. The Companys
federal AMT credits, related to its filed 2001 and prior year
tax returns, totaled $17 at December31, 2002. These
federal AMT credits carry forward indefinitely, for which no
valuation allowance has been recorded. Along with numerous other companies and banks in
France, PdM was subject to a tax claim with respect to its
purchase of certain bonds in 1988 which were represented by the
two selling banks as carrying specific tax benefits. The French
taxing authority challenged the use by PdM of those benefits. In
1997, PdM fully accrued the assessed principal and interest
following a court decision and, while appealing the court
decision 55 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts subsequently paid the $06 final assessment in
2001 so that there is no remaining risk of loss. Since the claim
against PdM by the French taxing authority related to a period
prior to PdM joining the SMF consolidated tax group, the
unfavorable outcome could not be offset with the NOLs of the
consolidated tax group. PdM had filed claims against each
selling bank on the basis of their misrepresentation of certain
facts. The Companys claim against one of the banks was
rejected by a trial court in 1996 and the Company appealed this
decision. In 1997, the case against the other bank was stayed
until the claim filed by the French taxing authority against PdM
was resolved. In 2002, the French court reached a decision that
companies such as PdM could pursue claims against the banks that
sold the purportedly tax-advantaged bonds. PdM has submitted the
necessary information to the court to pursue its claims against
the selling banks. PdM will continue to pursue such claims in
hopes of recovering against the selling banks. As of
December31, 2002, no asset has been recorded for this
potential recovery. Note7.Postretirement
and Other Benefits North
American Pension Benefits The Company and its subsidiary in Canada have
defined benefit retirement plans which cover substantially all
full-time employees. Retirement benefits are based on years of
service and generally on the average compensation earned in the
highest five of the last 15years of service. Retirees as
of the date of the Companys spin-off from Kimberly-Clark
remained participants of their respective Kimberly-Clark plans.
Employees as of the date of the spin-off retained credit for
prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark. The
Companys Canadian retirement benefit plan assets and
liabilities are immaterial and therefore are not included in the
following disclosures. Effective July1, 2000, the Company amended
its defined benefit retirement plan for U.S.employees to
include a cash balance benefit formula that covers all salaried
employees hired on or after July1, 2000 and all salaried
employees as of July1, 2000, except those salaried
employees who were grandfathered and chose to retain
retirement benefits under the terms of the plan prior to this
amendment, a final average pay formula benefit. Salaried
employees who, as of July1, 2000, had either attained the
sum of their age plus years of vesting service equal to 65 or
more, or attained the sum of their age plus years of vesting
service equal to 60 or more and had at least 15years of
vesting service were grandfathered under the plan and could
elect either the new cash balance benefit formula or the final
average pay benefit formula. For employees under the cash
balance formula, the Company will annually credit to the
employees account balance a retirement contribution
credit, which is a percentage of the employees earnings
with the percentage varying based on the years of vesting
service in the plan, and an interest credit, based on the
average yield for 30-year treasury bills. During 2001 and 2002,
the Company amended its defined benefit plan for U.S. employees
to include a similar cash balance formula that covers all hourly
employees at its Ancram, New York and Spotswood, New Jersey
mills. The retirement benefit for all new hourly employees at
those mills will be based on the new cash balance benefit
formula. All existing hourly employees at the Ancram mill, and
all hourly employees with five or more years of service at the
Spotswood mill, elected either the new cash balance benefit
formula or to retain the final average pay benefit formula. As
of December31, 2002, there were a total of 598 salaried
and hourly active employees covered by the plans final
average pay benefit formula and 228 salaried and hourly active
employees covered by the plans cash balance benefit
formula. There were also a total of 206 plan participants
collecting monthly benefits under the plans final average
pay benefit formula. 56 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

The assumed long-term rate of return on pension
assets for purposes of pension expense recognition for the U.S.
employee plans was 95percent for 2002 and
100percent for both 2001 and 2000. The assumed long-term
rate of return is determined by evaluating historical and
projected returns for benchmark equity and fixed income market
indices as well as the projected investment mix of the
Companys pension assets. The asset allocation policy of
the Companys U.S. employee pension plan targets an
allocation of 65percent in equity securities and
35percent in fixed income securities. A change in the
long-term rate of return assumption of 050percent would
change the Companys estimated 2003 U.S.pension
expense by approximately $025. Transition adjustments for these
plans are being amortized on the straight-line method over 14 to
18years. The discount rates used to determine the
projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation
for the U.S.employee pension plans were 65percent
and 725percent at December31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The discount rate fluctuates from year to year
based on current market interest rates for high-quality
fixed-income investments. The Company also evaluates the
expected average duration of its pension obligations in
determining its discount rate. A change in the discount rate
assumption of 025percent would change the Companys
estimated 2003 U.S.pension expense by approximately $025.
The assumed long-term rate of compensation increases used to
determine the projected benefit obligations for these plans was
35percent for both December31, 2002 and 2001. 57 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

$636, respectively, as of December31, 2001. French
Pension Benefits In France, employees are covered under a
government administered program. In addition, the Companys
French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans which pay a
lump sum retirement benefit to all permanent employees who
retire from the Company. The Companys French operations
also sponsor a supplemental executive pension plan which is
designed to provide a retirement benefit equal to between 50 and
65percent of final earnings, depending upon years of
service, after considering other government and Company
sponsored retirement plans. As of December31, 2002, there
were a total of 161 active and 10 retired employees in the
supplemental executive pension plan. Plan assets are principally
invested in the general asset portfolio of a French insurance
company. The Companys net pension expense for the
French pension plans was $23, $14 and $17 for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The assumed
long-term rates of return on pension assets for purposes of
pension expense recognition for the French plans were
50percent for 2002 and 2001, and 45percent for
2000. Transition adjustments for these plans are being amortized
on the straight-line method over 19 to 20years. The

obligation and 58 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

projected benefit obligation for these plans were
35percent and 30percent at December31, 2002
and 2001, respectively. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the French
pension plans were $244, $146 and $108, respectively, as of
December31, 2002, and $184, $125 and $70, respectively,
as of December31, 2001. The Companys net accrued
pension liability for the French plans was $52 and $68 at
December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At
December31, 2002 and 2001, the net accrued pension
liability balances included additional minimum pension
liabilities of $17 and $37, respectively, which balances were
also reflected net of tax in the balance of accumulated other
comprehensive income losson the consolidated balance
sheet. Brazilian
Pension Benefits In Brazil, employees are covered under a
government-administered program. Postretirement
Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits The Company and its subsidiary in Canada have
unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans which cover
substantially all retirees of the Company. Eligibility for
benefits under the Companys plans is based on years of
service and age at retirement. Retirees as of the date of the
spin-off remained participants of their respective
Kimberly-Clark plans. Employees as of the date of the spin-off
retained credit for prior service while employees of
Kimberly-Clark. The Companys plans are noncontributory for
certain long service employees when they retire, but are
contributory for most other future retirees. The Companys
Canadian postretirement benefits liability is immaterial and
therefore is not included in the following disclosures. Effective July1, 2000, the Company amended
its postretirement healthcare and group life insurance coverages
for U.S. salaried employees, except certain grandfathered
employees. Grandfathered employees will continue to receive
retiree healthcare coverage and life insurance coverage at rates
subsidized by the Company. For all other U.S. salaried
employees, future retiree healthcare coverage access will be
offered at full cost to the retiree. During 2001 and 2002, the
Company similarly amended its U.S. postretirement and group life
insurance coverages for hourly employees at its Spotswood and
Ancram mills. The components of U.S.employee

For purposes of measuring the benefit obligation
at December31, 2002, a 90percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
was assumed for 2003 and 2004. The rate was assumed to decrease
to 80percent in 2005, 70percent in 2006,
60percent in 2007 and 50 percent for 2008 and
thereafter. For purposes of measuring the benefit obligation at
December31, 2001, a 60percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits
was assumed for 2002, with the annual rate declining to
50percent for 2003 and thereafter. Discount rates of
65percent and 725percent were used to determine
the postretirement benefit obligations at December31, 2002
and 2001, respectively. A one-percentage point increase or decrease in
the healthcare cost trend rate would have a nominal effect on
the total of the service and interest cost components of the
postretirement benefit obligation, as well as the total
postretirement benefit obligation, at December31, 2002. Other
Benefits Substantially all of the Companys
U.S.employees have been given the opportunity to
participate in a voluntary retirement savings plan. Under the
plan, the Company matches a portion of employee contributions.
Employees may reallocate their respective account balances,
including any balances in the Companys common stock,
amongst any number of the available investment choices under the
plan provisions once each calendar quarter. The Companys
cost under the plan reflected in the accompanying consolidated
income statements was $09 for each of the years 2002, 2001 and
2000. At December31, 2002 and 2001, 500,000shares of
the Companys common stock were reserved for issuance under
the plan, none of which had been issued as of December31,
2002. The shares may, at the Companys option, be used to
satisfy the Companys liability for its matching
contributions. Beginning in 2000, the Company also provides
U.S.executives, certain other key personnel and its
directors the opportunity to participate in deferred
compensation plans. Those participating employees can elect to
defer a portion of their salaries and certain other
compensation. Those participating directors can elect to defer
their meeting fees, as a cash deferral, as well as their
quarterly retainer fees, as deferred stock unit credits. The
Companys liability balance under these plans totaled $13
and $09 at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which
is included on the consolidated balance sheet in Other
Noncurrent Liabilities. In connection with these plans, as well
as the Companys supplemental executive retirement and

STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share

Grantor trust investments are primarily in company-owned life
insurance policies. The balance of grantor trust assets totaled
$11 and $08 at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
which is included in Other Assets on the consolidated balance
sheet. In accordance with French law, certain salaried
employees in France may accumulate unused regular vacation and
supplemental hours of paid leave that can be credited to an
individuals Compte Epargne Temps CET. The
CET account may grow over an individuals career and the
hours accumulated may be withdrawn upon retirement or under
other special circumstances at the individuals then
current rate of pay. The balance of the Companys liability
for this program reflected in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet was $34 and $26 at December31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Note8.Stockholders
Equity The Companys Certificate of Incorporation
authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000shares of
common stock, par value $10 per share, and
10,000,000shares of preferred stock, par value $10 per
share. Each share of outstanding common stock and common stock
issued after the date of this report will have attached to it,
one right to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth 1/100
of a share of a series of preferred stock designated as the
SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock the
SeriesA Preferred Stock a
Right. Each Right entitles a shareholder to
purchase from the Company one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share
of the SeriesA Preferred Stock at a price of $65 per one
one-hundredth 1/100 of a share, subject to certain
anti-dilution adjustments. The Rights, however, become
exercisable only at such time as a person or group acquires, or
commences a public tender or exchange offer for, 15percent
or more of the Companys common stock. The Rights have
certain anti-takeover effects since they may cause substantial
dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the
Company on terms not approved by the Companys Board of
Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any merger or
other business combination approved by the Board of Directors
since they may be redeemed by the Company at $01 per Right at
any time until a person or group has obtained beneficial
ownership of 15percent or more of the voting stock. The
Rights will expire October1, 2010, unless redeemed earlier
by the Company. The SeriesA Preferred Stock will be
non-redeemable and, unless otherwise provided in connection with
the creation of a subsequent series of preferred stock, will be
subordinate to any other series of the Companys preferred
stock. Each share of SeriesA Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive when, as and if declared, a quarterly
dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $1 per share or
100 times the cash dividends declared on the Companys
common stock. In addition, the SeriesA Preferred Stock is
entitled to 100 times any non-cash dividends other than
dividends payable in shares of common stock or a subdivision of
the outstanding shares of common stock declared on the common
stock, in like kind. In the event of a liquidation, the holders
of the SeriesA Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive
a liquidation payment in an amount equal to the greater of $100
per share or 100 times the payment made per share of common
stock. Each share of SeriesA Preferred Stock will have 100
votes, voting together with the common stock. In the event of
any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which common
shares are exchanged, each share of SeriesA Preferred
Stock will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received
per share of common stock. The rights of the SeriesA
Preferred Stock as to dividends, liquidation and voting are
protected by antidilution provisions. 61 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

The Companys Equity Participation Plan
provides that eligible employees may be granted stock options
which, when exercised, give the recipient the right to purchase
the Companys common stock at a price no less than the
fair market value as defined in the Equity
Participation Plan of such stock at grant date. Options awarded
under the Equity Participation Plan only become exercisable
after specified periods of employment after the grant thereof
30 percent after the first year, 30percent after the
second year and the remaining 40percent after the third
year. Generally, such options expire ten years subsequent to
the date of grant. At December31, 2002, 2,235,000 shares
of the Companys common stock were reserved under the
Equity Participation Plan. At December31, 2002, there were

62 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts Effective December 1999, the Company established
a Restricted Stock Plan which is intended to promote the
long-term financial success of the Company by attracting to the
Company and retaining outstanding executive personnel and to
motivate such personnel by means of restricted stock grants. The
Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors
selects participants and establishes the terms of any grant of
restricted stock. The Companys Restricted Stock Plan
provides that such a grant immediately transfers ownership
rights in shares of the Companys common stock to the
recipient of the grant, including the right to vote the shares
and to receive dividends thereon, at a share price established
by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. The
recipients continued ownership of and right to freely
transfer the restricted stock is subject to such conditions on
transferability and to such risks of forfeiture as are
established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant,
which may include continued employment with the Company for a
defined period, achievement of specified management performance
objectives or other conditions established by the Compensation
Committee. The number of shares which may be issued under this
Restricted Stock Plan is limited to the lesser of 200,000 shares
or the number of treasury shares held by the Company as of the
date of any grant. No single participant may be awarded, in the
aggregate, more than 50percent of the shares authorized to
be issued under the Restricted Stock Plan. As of
December31, 2002, 60,000 restricted shares had been issued
under the Restricted Stock Plan which will not vest until four
years of service from the date of the grant. The number of
shares available for future awards is limited, as of
December31, 2002, to 140,000. A reconciliation of the average number of common

Note9.Foreign
Currency Foreign currency gains losses have arisen from
settlement of transactions in non-local currencies and the
remeasurement of non-local currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the
operation is domiciled. Such gains losses included in other
income expense, net were $09 in 2002, $06 in 2001 and $06
in 2000. 63 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts Foreign currency risks arise from transactions
and commitments denominated in non-local currencies. These
transactions and commitments may include the purchase of
inventories or property, plant and equipment, the sale of
products and the repayment of loans. Management selectively hedges the Companys
foreign currency risks when it is practicable and cost effective
to do so. The instruments are purchased from well-known money
center banks, insurance companies or government agencies
counterparties. Usually the contracts extend for no more than
12months, although their contractual term has been as long
as 24months. Credit risks with respect to the
counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be
hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations
under the contracts, are minimal in view of the financial
strength of the counterparties. Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm
commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the
underlying hedged items. Premiums paid for options are amortized
ratably over the life of the option. All other gains and losses
are included in period income or expense based on the period-end
market price of the instrument. At December31, 2002, there were outstanding
forward contracts, which were held for purposes other than
trading, maturing at various dates in 2003, to purchase
approximately $5 of various foreign currencies. At
December31, 2001, there were outstanding forward
contracts, which were held for purposes other than trading,
maturing at various dates in 2002, to purchase approximately $16
of various foreign currencies. These contracts were designated
as cash flow hedges of foreign currency transactions to fix the
Companys local currency cash flow. These contracts had not
given rise to any significant net deferred gains or losses as of
December31, 2002 and December31, 2001, and their
fair values approximated their carrying value. Note10.Commitments Operating
Leases Future minimum obligations under non-cancelable
operating leases having an initial or remaining term in excess
of one year as of December31, 2002 are less than $15
annually over the next five years and thereafter. Rental expense
under operating leases was $43, $41 and $40 for the years
ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Other
Commitments A vendor of PdM operates a calcium carbonate
plant on-site at the Quimperle, France mill. Under the terms of
the agreement, which is currently scheduled to expire at the end
of 2009, the annual minimum contractual commitment is at a
quantity and price which would require $21 of calcium carbonate
purchases. Under this agreement, the net raw material price
expected to be paid is less than the net price at which the raw
material could otherwise be purchased, and thus the commitment
is not expected to result in a loss. The Companys
purchases for the mill in Quimperle were less than the minimum
annual commitment level during 2002. This matter is discussed
further under the caption Solvay Matter in
Note11. The on-site calcium carbonate plant in Quimperle
continues to operate and supply a portion of the Companys
calcium carbonate requirements in France, and the vendor
continues to work to develop alternative solutions to address
associated quality issues. Similarly, a vendor of SWM-B operates a calcium
carbonate plant on-site at the Pirahy, Brazil mill. Under that
agreement, which will expire in 2006, the net raw material
prices vary according to the quantities produced, however, SWM-B
is committed to pay at least the monthly fixed costs of the
calcium carbonate plant which are less than $01 per month.
Under this agreement, the net raw material price expected to be
paid is less than the net price at which the raw material could
otherwise be purchased, and thus the commitment is 64 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts not expected to result in a loss. Additionally,
SWM-Bs current annual level of calcium carbonate usage
exceeds its annual contractual minimum commitments. The Company enters into certain other immaterial
contracts from time to time for the purchase of certain raw
materials. The Company also enters into certain contracts for
the purchase of equipment and related costs in connection with
its ongoing capital projects which, at December31, 2002,
totaled approximately $234, primarily related to a new
reconstituted tobacco leaf production line project in Spay,
France. The Company operates at its Lee Mills facility a
machine that is owned by Kimberly-Clark. Ownership of the
machine was retained by Kimberly-Clark in the 1995 spin-off of
the Company as it operates solely for the purpose of producing a
proprietary product used as an in-process material by
Kimberly-Clark. Under the contract for its continued operation,
the current term of which is scheduled to expire in December
2009, the Company essentially bills Kimberly-Clark the actual
costs of operating the machine, including allocations of
indirect and fixed overhead costs. While certain of such costs
could be eliminated if the contract is not renewed or is
otherwise terminated, the Company may be unable to eliminate a
portion of the approximately $2 of indirect and fixed overhead
costs that are currently absorbed by that operation. As of December31, 2002, the Company had
issued guarantee instruments in connection with certain
agreements and as required by regulatory agencies in connection
with certain of the Companys ongoing obligations, as
follows: iThe Company issued a surety bond to the State
of Massachusetts beginning in 1998 in the principal amount of
$15 related to the Companys ongoing obligation for
post-closure monitoring and maintenance of a landfill site. This
surety bond is scheduled for annual renewal in April 2003. The
Company has a liability recorded at December31, 2002 of
$04 based on its current estimate of the remaining costs to
perform such post-closure care. iiSince 1995, the
Company has issued an annual letter of credit to an insurance
company, the current principal amount of which was $09 as of
December31, 2002, in connection with its administration of
the Companys workers compensation claims in the United
States, for which the Company has recorded a liability of $10
at December31, 2002. iiiThe Company began issuing
a letter of credit to the Township of East Brunswick, New Jersey
beginning in 1988, the current principal amount of which was
$07 as of December31, 2002, in connection with the
Companys long-term obligation related to the
municipalitys recovery of the cost of installation of a
water line to the Companys Spotswood mill, for which the
Company has recorded the liability of $07 at December31,
2002. ivThe Company has certain other letters of credit
and surety bonds outstanding at December31, 2002, which
are not material either individually or in the aggregate. Note11.Legal
Proceedings ICMS
Matter On December27, 2000, SWM-B received two
assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil concerning Imposto sobre Circulao de
Mercadorias e Servios ICMS, a form of
value-added tax, consisting of unpaid ICMS taxes from January
1995 through November 2000, together with interest and penalties
in the total amount of approximately $136, based on the foreign
currency exchange rate at December31, 2000 collectively,
the Assessment. The Assessment concerned the
accrual and use by SWM-B of ICMS tax credits generated from the
production and sale of certain non-tobacco related grades of
paper sold domestically that are immune from the tax to offset
ICMS taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not
immune. A portion of the Assessment, estimated at
December31, 2000 at approximately $69, related to tax
periods that predated the Companys acquisition of Pirahy
and is covered by an indemnification from the sellers of Pirahy
Assessment1. The second assessment pertains
exclusively to periods that SWM-B owned the Pirahy mill
Assessment2. While SWM-B is primarily
responsible for the full payment of the Assessment in the event
of an ultimate unfavorable outcome, SWM-B is not aware of 65 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts any difficulties that would be encountered in
obtaining reimbursement of that portion of any payment resulting
from Assessment1 from the previous owner under the
indemnification. SWM-B contests the Assessment based on
Article150, VI of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of
1988, which grants immunity from ICMS taxes to papers used in
the production of books, newspapers and periodicals
immune papers and the raw material inputs used to
produce immune papers. SWM-B further contends that the statutory
provision relied on by the State of Rio de Janeiro to argue that
ICMS tax credits generated in the course of the production of
immune papers must be reversed rather than applied to other ICMS
taxes owed violates the Brazilian Federal Constitution and the
legal principle of non-cumulativity for ICMS tax set
forth in Article155, Section2, II, of the Brazilian
Federal Constitution of 1988. Additionally, SWM-B contends that
the statutory provisions relied on by the government do not
address immunity from the incidence of the ICMS tax,
but are addressed to exception from the tax. This
distinction is central to SWM-Bs further contention that
the only exceptions permitted to the constitutionally mandated
principle of non-cumulativity are for exemptions from tax and no
exceptions from this principle are permitted in cases of
immunity from tax. Administrative appeals were filed on the
Assessment, and in April 2001 and August 2001 decisions were
rendered on these administrative appeals. The State of Rio de
Janeiro tax authorities denied the appeal of Assessment2
in its entirety and reduced the original amount of
Assessment1 by approximately $16 based on SWM-Bs
argument that Assessment1 covered periods barred by the
applicable statute of limitations. Following these decisions at
the administrative level, judicial actions to annul the tax and
to enjoin enforcement of the Assessment pending adjudication
were filed in Rio de Janeiro on behalf of SWM-B. The courts
issued injunctions, which were upheld on appeal, against
enforcement of the Assessment without the requirement for any
bond or posting of other collateral by SWM-B, pending final
determination of SWM-Bs action to annul the tax debts.
SWM-B continues to vigorously contest the Assessment and
believes that the Assessment will ultimately be resolved in its
favor. However, the final resolution of this matter will most
likely entail judicial proceedings up to and including
presentation of the matter to the Supreme Court of Brazil and is
not likely to be finally resolved for several years. Based on
the foreign currency exchange rate at December31, 2002,
the Assessment, as reduced in August 2001, totaled approximately
$84 as of December31, 2002, of which approximately $37
is covered by the above-discussed indemnification. No liability
has been recorded in the Companys consolidated financial
statements for the Assessment based on the Companys
evaluation that SWM-B is more likely than not to prevail in its
challenge of the Assessment under the facts and law as presently
understood. Solvay
Matter During 1998, PdM, a wholly-owned indirect French
subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement with one of
its vendors, Solvay Specialties France S.A.
Solvay, in connection with PdMs purchases of
calcium carbonate. Solvay agreed to construct and operate an
on-site plant at the Quimperle, France mill at a capital cost of
approximately 40million French franc $64 at the
December31, 2002 exchange rate. If PdM buys less than the
minimum purchase commitments under the agreement, for reasons
not permitted under the agreement, Solvay can terminate the
contract and require PdM to pay Solvay the then net book value
of the building and equipment, determined using a straight-line
method of depreciation over the life of the agreement, which
amount was approximately $45 at December31, 2002, as well
as costs to dismantle the mill and severance pay for the
employees, together estimated at approximately $04. During the
first six months of 2002, PdM determined that the slurry-form
calcium carbonate produced by the on-site plant was causing
variations in some of its products. The agreement provides
generally that use of the slurry-form calcium carbonate will not
have a notable effect on PdMs products compared to their
production using the dry-form of calcium carbonate provided by
Solvay. Because of the product variations it was detecting and
in order to comply with customers specifications for its
products, PdM reduced its consumption of slurry-form 66 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts calcium carbonate and subsequently purchased less
than the minimum annual purchase commitment of slurry-form
calcium carbonate produced by the on-site plant during 2002,
substituting dry-form calcium carbonate from Solvay in its
place. The on-site plant continues to operate and supply a
portion of PdMs calcium carbonate requirements and Solvay
continues to work to develop alternative solutions to address
the quality issues associated with calcium carbonate produced by
the on-site plant. The quality problems with the slurry-form
calcium carbonate continued in the third and fourth quarters,
but PdM has undertaken efforts to mitigate the issues associated
with use of the slurry, which may allow it to increase its
consumption of the slurry. Since the amount of slurry-form
calcium carbonate purchased from Solvay has been less than the
original amount contemplated, Solvay has requested payment
corresponding to a reduction in the contractual quantity
discounts that had been provided to PdM in 2002 and prior years,
to which PdM disagrees. On November22, 2002, PdM received service
of process concerning an action filed by Solvay in the Tribunal
de Commerce court sitting in Paris, France. The principal
parties to this action are Solvay and PdM. The action petitions
the court to appoint an expert for the purpose of determining
the rights and obligations under the contract concerning the
satellite precipitated calcium carbonate plant installed at the
PdM mill by Solvay, which has not, according to PdM, produced
product in accordance with the contract terms. The action, the
factual basis of which is described above, asks the court to
adjudicate the price level that should apply under the contract
to deliveries of product from the satellite plant and from other
Solvay production facilities. The dispute over the applicable
price arises due to contractual price provisions that are based
upon levels of consumption of product from the satellite plant
that PdM contends it cannot consume due to the plants
inability to deliver product of a quality contemplated by the
contract. PdM has good and meritorious defenses to Solvays
claims and, based on the Companys current understanding of
the facts and law and the expected outcome if fully litigated,
this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Companys operations or financial results. The Company
believes that the matter will be resolved short of a full and
final adjudication by the court, and PdM has established an
accounting reserve in an amount it considers reasonable to
achieve a settlement that would be less than the estimated cost
and associated uncertainty inherent in fully litigating the
matter. Indemnification
Matter In connection with the Companys spin-off
from Kimberly-Clark and pursuant to the resulting Transfer,
Contribution and Assumption Agreement and the related
Distribution Agreement between Kimberly-Clark and the Company
dated October23, 1995, the Company undertook to indemnify
and hold Kimberly-Clark harmless from claims and liabilities
related to the businesses transferred to the Company that were
not identified as excluded liabilities in the above-mentioned
agreements. To date, no claims which the Company deems material
to its financial condition or results of operations have been
tendered to the Company under this indemnification that have not
been previously disclosed. As of the date of these financial
statements, there are no claims pending under this
indemnification that the Company deems to be material. General
Matters The Company is involved in certain other legal
actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Management believes that such litigation and claims will be
resolved without a material adverse effect on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. Note12.Environmental
Matters The Companys operations are subject to
federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances
relating to various environmental matters. The nature of the
Companys operations expose it to the risk of claims with
respect to environmental matters, and there can be no assurance
that material costs or liabilities will not be 67 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued U.S. $ in millions, except per share
amounts incurred in connection with such claims. The
Company, or its predecessor, is currently named as a potentially
responsible party at one hazardous waste disposal site, for
which the Company previously recorded a liability for its
pro-rata share of the estimated remediation cost; the remainder
of this accrued liability at December31, 2002 is not
material. Also, the Company has a continuing responsibility for
the post-closure care of a landfill site, the estimated cost of
which the Company also has recorded a liability and the
remainder of which is not material. While the Company has
incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur,
capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, the Company believes that
its future cost of compliance with environmental laws,
regulations and ordinances, and its exposure to liability for
environmental claims and its obligation to participate in the
remediation or the monitoring of certain hazardous waste
disposal sites, will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial condition or results of operations.
However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and
regulations, or unknown contamination of sites owned, operated
or used for waste disposal by the Company including
contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites
or other waste generators may give rise to additional costs
which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition or results of operations. The Company incurs spending necessary to meet
legal requirements and otherwise relating to the protection of
the environment at the Companys facilities in the United
States, France, Brazil and Canada. For these purposes, the
Company incurred total capital expenditures of $60 in 2002, and
anticipates that it will incur approximately $5 to $6 in 2003
and approximately $2 to $4 in 2004, of which no material amount
is the result of environmental fines or settlements. The major
projects included in these estimates are $33 to upgrade
wastewater treatment facilities and $13 for installation of ink
solvent treatment equipment, both in France, and wastewater
treatment facility upgrade projects in connection with capacity
expansions, one each in France and the United States of $38 and
$30, respectively. The foregoing capital expenditures are not
expected to reduce the Companys ability to invest in other
appropriate and necessary capital projects and are not expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial condition or results of operations. Note13.Business
Segments and Geography Business
Segment Reporting The Company is operated and managed based on the
geographical location of its manufacturing operations: the
United States, France and Brazil. These business segments
manufacture and sell cigarette, plug wrap and tipping papers,
used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco
products and paper products used in cigarette packaging. While
the products are similar in each segment, they vary based on
customer requirements and the manufacturing capabilities of each
location. Sales by a segment into markets primarily served by a
different segment occur where specific product needs cannot be
cost-effectively met by the manufacturing operations domiciled
in that segment. Tobacco industry products comprised 88 to
93percent of the Companys consolidated net sales in
each of the years 2002, 2001 and 2000. The Companys
non-tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products,
certain of which represent commodity paper grades produced to
maximize machine operations. Consolidated
Operations by Segment For purposes of the segment disclosure in the
following tables, the term United States includes
operations in the United States and Canada. The Canadian
operations only produce flax fiber used as raw material in the
U.S. operations. Eliminations of intercompany sales of products
between segments are referred to in the following table as
intersegment sales. Expense amounts not associated with segments

Note14.Major
Customers Two of the Companys customers have
accounted for a significant portion of the Companys net
sales in the periods presented in the financial statements, and
the loss of one or both such customers, or a significant
reduction in one or both of these customers purchases,
could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations. Net sales to Philip Morris Incorporated
Philip Morris, together with its affiliates and
designated converters, accounted for approximately
28percent, 32percent and 30percent of total
consolidated net sales for the years ended December31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net sales to B.A.T.
Industries PLC BAT, together with its affiliates
and designated converters, accounted for approximately
19percent, 18percent and 17percent of
consolidated net sales for the years ended December31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Each of the Companys
segments reported sales to these customers for each of the
respective periods reported above. The Company had sales to the minority shareholder
of LTRI of $180, $187 and $191 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The Companys consolidated accounts
receivable at December31, 2002 and 2001 included balances
from Philip Morris and BAT, together with their respective
affiliates and designated converters. The percentage of these
customers balances of consolidated accounts receivable is
less than each of their respective percentages of consolidated
net sales. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
on all of its customers financial condition and generally
does not require collateral or other security to support
customer receivables. A substantial portion of the
Companys consolidated accounts receivable are due from
companies in the tobacco industry which has been and continues
to be under substantial pressure from legal, regulatory and tax
developments. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such
litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or
future litigation, regulatory actions and additional taxes may
have on the tobacco industry, its financial liquidity or
relationships with its suppliers. Nor is it possible to predict
what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco
products will be enacted, or to what extent, if any, such
legislation or regulations might affect the tobacco products
industry in general. 70 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND

71 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Atlanta, Georgia 
January27, 2003 January31, 2003 as to Note 5 72 SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL INC. AND
SUBSIDIARIES MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL
REPORTING The management of Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc. is responsible for conducting all aspects of
the business, including the preparation of the financial
statements in this Annual Report. The financial statements have
been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America considered appropriate in the
circumstances to present fairly the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a
consistent basis. Management also has prepared the other
information in this Annual Report and is responsible for its
accuracy and consistency with the financial statements. As can be expected in a complex and dynamic
business environment, some financial statement amounts are based
on managements estimates and judgments. Even though
estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to
provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of
the financial information contained in this Annual Report. These
measures include an effective control-oriented environment in
which a company-wide internal control program plays an important
role, an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors which
oversees the financial reporting and disclosure processes, and
independent audits. As part of that responsibility, the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board of Directors the selection of
the Companys independent public auditors, Deloitte 
Touche LLP. One characteristic of a control-oriented
environment is a system of internal control over financial
reporting and disclosures and over safeguarding of assets
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition, designed
to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of
Directors regarding preparation of reliable published financial
statements and such asset safeguarding. The system is supported
with written policies and procedures and contains
self-monitoring mechanisms. Appropriate actions are taken by
management to correct deficiencies as they are identified. All
internal control systems have inherent limitations, including
the possibility of circumvention and overriding of controls, and
therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance as to financial
statement preparation and such asset safeguarding. Management
believes the Companys system of internal control maintains
an appropriate cost-benefit relationship. The Company has also adopted a code of conduct
which, among other things, contains policies for conducting
business affairs in a lawful and ethical manner in each country
in which it does business, for avoiding potential conflicts of
interest, and for preserving confidentiality of information and
business ideas. Internal controls have been implemented to
provide reasonable assurance that the code of conduct is
followed. The financial statements have been audited by
Deloitte Touche LLP. During their audits, the independent
auditors were given unrestricted access to all financial records
and related data. Management believes that all representations
made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid
and appropriate. During the audits conducted by the independent
auditors, management received minor recommendations to
strengthen or modify internal controls in response to
developments and changes. Management has adopted, or is in the
process of adopting, all recommendations which are
cost-effective. Wayne H. Deitrich Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Paul C. Roberts Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer January27, 2003 73 PART II, Continued
