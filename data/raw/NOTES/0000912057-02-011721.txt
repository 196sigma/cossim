SOUTHERN PERU COPPER CORPORATION
and SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of consolidation:
The consolidated financial statements of Southern Peru Copper Corporation and
Subsidiaries the Company include the accounts of significant subsidiaries in
which the Company has voting control, and are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Use of estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Revenue recognition:
Substantially all of the Company copper is sold under annual contracts.
Revenue is recognized primarily in the month product is delivered to customers
based on prices as provided in sales contracts. When the price is not
determinable at the time of shipment to customers, revenue is recognized based
on prices prevailing at the time of shipment with final pricing generally
occurring within three months of shipment. Revenues with respect to these sales
are adjusted in the period of settlement to reflect final pricing and in periods
prior to settlement to reflect any decline in market prices, which may occur
between shipment and settlement. The Company sells copper in blister and refined
form at industry standard commercial terms. Net sales include the invoiced value
of copper, silver, molybdenum, acid, and gains from the sale or settlement of
copper put options.
Cash equivalents and marketable securities:
Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with maturity of three
months or less, when purchased. Marketable securities include short-term liquid
investments with a maturity of more than three months, when purchased, and are
carried at cost, which approximates market.
Inventories:
Metal inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market. Costs
incurred in the production of metal inventories exclude general and
administrative costs. Supplies inventories are carried at average cost less a
reserve for obsolescence.
Property:
Assets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. In accordance
with SFAS No. 121,Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the Company reviews long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles related to those assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. Any impairment loss on such assets, as well as
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of, is
measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets less disposal costs, if applicable.
The Company evaluates the carrying value of assets based on undiscounted future
cash flows considering expected metal prices based on historical metal prices
and price trends.                                       A32
Betterments, renewals, costs of bringing new mineral properties into production,
and the cost of major development programs at existing mines are capitalized as
mineral land. Maintenance, repairs, normal development costs at existing mines,
and gains or losses on assets retired or sold are reflected in earnings as
incurred. Buildings and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method
over estimated lives from 5 to 40 years or the estimated life of the mine if
shorter. Depletion of mineral land is computed by the units-of-production method
using proven and probable ore reserves.
Exploration:
Tangible and intangible costs incurred in the search for mineral properties are
charged against earnings when incurred.
Hedging Activities:
Derivative instruments may be used to manage exposure to market risk from
changes in commodity prices, interest rates or the value of the Company assets
and liabilities. Derivative instruments, which are designated as hedges, must be
deemed highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure
being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported in current earnings.
The Company may purchase put options or create synthetic put options to reduce
or eliminate the risk of metal price declines below the option strike price on a
portion of its anticipated future sales. Options are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings. Realized gains or
losses from the sale or exercise of options, are recognized in the period in
which the underlying hedged production is sold.
Swap Agreements:
Fuel swap agreements limit the effect of changes in the price of fuel. Fuel
swaps are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in
current earnings. The differential to be paid or received as fuel prices change
is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the period the swap covers.
Foreign Currency:
The Company may use foreign currency swaps to limit the effects of exchange rate
changes on future cash flow obligations denominated in foreign currencies. A
currency swap establishes a fixed dollar cost for a fixed amount of foreign
currency required at a future date. Foreign currency swaps are carried at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings. The
difference between the published price of foreign currency and the price
established in the contract for the month covered by the swap is recognized as
part of the underlying transaction.
Stock-Based Compensation:
The Company applies the disclosure only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Currency Translation:
The Company is domiciled in Peru but its functional currency is the US dollar.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
Peruvian Branch Branch. The Branch maintains its books of account in new
Soles. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, the books of the Branch are remeasured
into the US dollar. The resulting remeasurement adjustments are recorded to
income.
Impact of New Accounting Standards:
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company has adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 138 Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. Such adoption
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of
December 31, 2001.                                       A33
In September 2001, The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible
assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. The provisions of
this statement are required to be applied, starting with fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001, to all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized
in its financial statements at that date. Impairment losses for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial application of
this statement resulting from a transitional impairment test are to be
reported as resulting from a change in accounting principles. Goodwill and
intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 will be subject immediately to
the non-amortization and amortization provisions of this statement. The Company
adopted this statement effective January 1, 2002 and its implementation will not
materially affect its results of operations or financial condition.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligation, which will be required to be adopted effective January 1, 2003.
SFAS No. 143 establishes standards for accounting for an obligation associated
with the retirement of long-lived tangible assets. Management is assessing the
impact of this statement on our results of operations and financial position.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. This statement
supersedes FASB statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations
- - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for
the disposal of a segment of business as previously defined in that Opinion.
Management does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material
impact on the operations or financial condition of the Company.
2. Foreign Exchange
The functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company sales,
cash, trade receivables, fixed asset additions, trade payables and debt are
primarily dollar-denominated. A portion of the operating costs of the Company is
denominated in Peruvian soles.
Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in
Cost of sales and amounted to $23 million, $29 million, and $25
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
3. Restructuring Charges
The Company 1999 results include a $56 million pre-tax charge $36 million
after-tax and workers' participations for severance costs associated with the
Company ongoing cost reduction program. The severance costs accrued are for
337 employees at the Company locations in Peru and Miami, Florida.
Approximately $38 million of the provision is included as a cost of sales
deduction on the Company statement of earnings, and a $18 million is included
in administrative expense as it relates to non-operating personnel. This accrual
was paid in full in 1999.
4. Administrative Reorganization
The Company 1999 results include an $84 million pre-tax charge $54 million
after-tax and workers' participations associated with the severance cost of the
early termination of foreign contract employees. The severance costs accrued are                                       A34
for 55 terminated employees at the Company location in Peru. Approximately
$58 million of the provision is included as a cost of sales deduction on the
Company statement of earnings and $26 million is included in administrative
expense as it relates to non-operating personnel. Payments in the amount of $55
million and $29 million were made in the years 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Total net deferred tax liabilities                $867       $908
The net deferred tax liabilities above reflect deferred tax assets of $309
million and $322 million, before valuation allowance, and deferred tax
liabilities of $995 million and $1051 million at December 31, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively.
At December 31, 2001, the foreign tax credit carryforward available to reduce
possible future U.S. income tax amounted to approximately $5 million expiring as
follows: $31 million in 2003, $12 million in 2004 and $07 million in 2006.
Foreign tax credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $0 million and $156
million expired in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Foreign tax credit carryforwards
amounting to approximately $105 million were utilized in 2000. Foreign tax
credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $07 million were created in
2001. Amounts utilized and expired in 2000 have previously been entirely offset
by a valuation allowance. Foreign tax credits created in 2001 were also offset
by a valuation allowance.
The Company has not recorded the benefit of foreign tax credit carryforwards
because of both the expiration dates and the rules governing the order in which
such credits are utilized. The Company also has not recorded a benefit for the
Alternative Minimum Tax AMT credits, which are not available to reduce AMT.
Because of limitations on both percentage depletion and foreign tax credits
under the AMT, the Company expects an AMT liability for the foreseeable future.
In 2001, due to the foreign sourced income limitation, foreign tax credits do
not completely offset the regular tax liability. Therefore, for 2001, AMT
credits are used to offset regular tax liability. While such credits do not
expire, it is unlikely they will continue to be utilized in the future.
Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of
the foreign tax credit carryforward and the AMT credit carryforward.                                       A36
On December 30, 2000, the transitory Peruvian Government issued a decree, which
included, among other things, a reduction in the statutory income tax rate for
reinvested earnings in 2001, from 30% to 20%. The Company did not qualify for
the reduced rate in 2001.
Additionally, on August 28, 2001, Peru newly elected Congress established a
new tax rate of 27% on all earnings plus a 41% rate on distributed earnings
starting in 2002. Under this provision, as a branch, SPCC earnings are deemed
distributed at the closing of the fiscal year.
The Company obtains income tax credits in Peru for value-added taxes paid in
connection with the purchase of capital equipment and other goods and services
employed in its operations and records these credits as a prepaid expense. Under
current Peruvian law, the Company is entitled to use the credits against its
Peruvian income tax liability or to receive a refund. The carrying value of
these Peruvian tax credits approximates their market value.
6. Net Sales Net sales by country were as follows:

At December 31, 2001, there were 376 million pounds of copper sales recorded at
a provisional price of 66 cents per pound.
Under the terms of a forward sales contract with Union Miniere as amended
through December 31, 1999, the Company is required to supply Union Miniere,
through its agent, S.A. SOGEM N.V., with 16,300 tons of blister copper annually
for a ten-year period from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2009. The price
of the copper, contained in blister, supplied under the contract is determined
based on the LME monthly average settlement price, less a refining allowance,
which is negotiated annually.
Under the terms of a sales contract with Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Mitsui, the Company
is required to supply Mitsui with 48,000 tons of copper cathodes annually for a
fifteen-year period through December 31, 2013. If the shipment destination is
Asia, the pricing of the cathodes is based upon the LME monthly average
settlement price, however, if destination of shipments is the United States, the
pricing of the cathodes is based upon the COMEX monthly average settlement plus
a producer premium, which is agreed upon annually based on world market terms.
Ninety thousand tons related to a prior contract period 1994-2000 will be
supplied as follows: 48,000 in 2014 and 42,000 in 2015.
Business Reporting Segments: Based on the information monitored by the Company
operating decision makers to manage the business, the Company has identified
that its operations are within one reportable segment. Accordingly, financial
information on industry segments is omitted because, apart from the principal
business of producing copper, the Company has no other industry segment.                                       A37
7. Financial Instruments
Hedging Activities: The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its
exposure to market risk from changes in commodity prices. Derivative instruments
which are designated as hedges must be deemed highly effective at reducing the
risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge
at the inception of the contract. Any ineffectiveness of the hedge is reported
in current earnings.
Copper: Depending on market fundamentals and other conditions, the Company may
purchase put options to reduce or eliminate the risk of price declines below the
option strike price on a portion of its anticipated future sales. Put options
purchased by the Company establish a minimum sales price for the production
covered by such put options and permit the Company to participate in price
increases above the option price. Options are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses recognized in current earnings. Depending upon market
conditions, the Company may either sell options it holds or exercise the options
at maturity. Realized gains or losses from the sale or exercise of options, net
of unamortized acquisition costs, are recognized in the period in which the
underlying production is sold and are reported as a component of the underlying
transaction.
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 the Company held no copper put
options.
Fuel swaps: the Company may enter into fuel swap agreements to limit the effect
of increases in fuel prices on its production cost. A fuel swap establishes a
fixed price for the quantity of fuel covered by the agreement. Fuel swaps are
carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in current
earnings. The difference between the published price for fuel and the price
established in the contract for the month covered by the swap is recognized in
production costs.
During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 the Company entered into a
fuel swap arrangement for which production costs would have been $188 million
and $107 million higher, if this exposure had not been hedged.
During the year ended December 31 2001, the Company had no fuel swap agreements.
Foreign currency: The Company selectively uses foreign currency swaps to limit
the effects of exchange rate changes on future cash flow obligations denominated
in foreign currencies. A currency swap establishes a fixed dollar cost for a
fixed amount of foreign currency required at a future date. Foreign currency
swaps are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in
current earnings. The difference between the published price for foreign
currency and the price established in the contract for the month covered by the
swap is recognized as part of the underlying transaction.
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company settled currency
swap agreements on a portion of its capital costs contracted in Euros for which
there was a loss of approximately $22 million and $48 million.
As of December 31, 2001, there were no currency swap agreements.
For certain of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivables and accounts payable
the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.
Consequently, such financial instruments are not included in the following table
that provides information about the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of other financial instruments                                       A38 At December 31,                2001               2000

Long-term debt: Fair value is based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues.
8. Workers' Participation
Provisions for workers' participation are calculated at 8% of pre-tax earnings
and are included in Cost of sales on the earnings statement. The current
portion of this participation, which is accrued during the year, is based on
Branch taxable income and is distributed to workers following determination of
final results for the year. During the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, the workers' participation expense was $59 million, $121 million and
$34 million, respectively. $43 million and $97 million were distributed for
2001 and 2000, respectively. No distribution was made for 1999.
9. Minority Interest of Investment Shares Previously known as Labor Shares
The minority interest of the Investment Shares is based on the earnings of the
Company Peruvian Branch.
The Company acquired 02 million, 04 million and 08 million investment shares
at a cost of $09 million, $15 million and $34 million in the years 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively. The carrying value of the minority interest purchased
was reduced by $07 million, $10 million and $21 million in 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively, and the excess paid over the carrying value was assigned
primarily to proven and probable sulfide and leachable ore reserves and
mineralized material and is being amortized based on production. As a result of
these acquisitions, the remaining investment shareholders hold a 147% interest
in the Branch at December 31, 2001, and are entitled to a pro rata participation
in the cash distributions made by the Company. The investment shares are
recorded as a minority interest in the Company financial statements.

In December 2001, the Company received authorization from the Comision Nacional
Supervisora de Empresas y Valores CONASEV to increase from $200 million to
$750                                       A40
million the issuance of bonds in the Peruvian market. The goal of this new
facility is to extend the maturity of SPCC current debt obligations and to
reduce financing costs. Under this program, on July 20, 2000, the Company issued
bonds for $30 million at a nominal fixed rate of 875%. On December 7, 2000 the
Company issued additional bonds for $20 million at the same rate; in both cases,
the maturity is seven years. In December 2001 the Company sold to investors in
Peru bonds for $731 million, with maturities ranging from March 2005 to
December 2011. The bonds have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 30% and were
issued through SPCC Peruvian Branch. On February 27, 2002, the Company sold to
investors in Peru bonds for $259 million, with maturities ranging from May 2005
to February 2012. The bonds have an interest rate of LIBOR plus 30% and were
issued also through SPCC Peruvian Branch. Proceeds from the sale of the bonds
will be used to finance a portion of SPCC expansion and modernization program.
The Peruvian market bond program approved in December 2001, contains financial
covenants, including a limitation on the payment of dividends to stockholders of
up to 50% of its net income for any fiscal year.
In March 1999, the Company concluded a $100 million, 15-year loan agreement with
Mitsui and Co., Ltd. The applicable interest for this loan is Japanese LIBO rate
plus 125%. This facility provides additional committed financing for SPCC
modernization and expansion program, and was fully disbursed as of December 31,
2001.
In 1997, the Company entered into a $600 million, seven-year loan facility with
a group of international financial institutions. The facility consisted of a
$400 million term loan and a $200 million revolving credit line. The interest
rate during years four and five of the agreement on any loans outstanding was
LIBOR plus 200% per annum for term loans and LIBOR plus 225% for revolving
credit loans. A commitment fee of 05% per annum was payable on the undrawn
portion of the facility. The term loan of $4000 million, which was disbursed in
March 2001, was prepaid and cancelled in full on December 17, 2001. A breakage
fee of $01 million was paid in connection with this prepayment. The unamortized
balance of $31 million $22 million net of income tax for the commission fee
was expensed as an extraordinary item in 2001.
Also, in 1997, the Company privately placed $150 million SENS in the United
States and International markets. These notes, which had been registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission had an average maturity of seven years,
due from May 2000 to May 2007, and were priced at par with a coupon rate of
79%. On February 1, 2002 the Company prepaid and cancelled the balance of the
$150 million Secured Export Notes. A premium of $114 million was paid related
to this prepayment and is being expensed in the first quarter of 2002 as an
extraordinary item.
At December 31, 2000 the Company had a loan outstanding with Corporacion Andina
de Fomento CAF of $39 million with interest based on LIBOR, and an
outstanding loan from the United States Export-Import Bank EXIM of $29
million, with interest at a 643% fixed rate. Both loans were payable in
semi-annual installments through 2001. These loans have been paid and fully
cancelled as at December 31, 2001.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $3960 million,
compared with $3472 million at December 31, 2000.
The former financing agreements contained covenants that limited the payment of
dividends to stockholders. Under the most restrictive covenant, the Company
could pay dividends to stockholders equal to 50% of the net income of the
Company for any fiscal quarter as long as such dividends were paid by June 30 of
the following year. Net assets of the Company unavailable for the payment of
dividends would                                       A41
have totaled $12 billion at December 31, 2001. The loan agreements containing
these limitations on the payment of dividends were prepaid and cancelled as of
December 31, 2001. In accordance with the most restrictive covenant of the
Company loan agreements, additional indebtedness of $8134 million would have
been permitted at December 31, 2001.
The Mitsui and Co., Ltd. credit agreement is collateralized by pledges of
receivables of 24,000 tons of copper per year. The EXIM Bank credit agreement
was collateralized by pledges of receivables from sales of 7,000 tons of copper
per year. Starting June 1, 2001 once the EXIM Bank loan was fully paid, these
7,000 tons were pledged to Mitsui and Co., Ltd. under the credit agreement. The
pledged tonnage under the Mitsui loan agreement currently totals 31,000 tons.
The CAF loan was collateralized by liens on the SX/EW facility. The SENS and the
seven-year loan facility required that most of the collections of export copper
sales be deposited into a trust account in the United States. Twenty percent of
these collections were used as collateral for the outstanding SENS with the
balance of the collections remitted directly to the Company. The excess funds in
the collateral account were remitted to the Company, if all financial
requirements were met. As part of these agreements, the Company had to maintain
three-month and six-month collection ratios, as defined aggregate collections
as a specified multiple of debt service. Both facilities required escrow
deposits of three months debt service. In addition, certain of the agreements
require the Company to maintain a minimum stockholders' equity of $750 million,
specific ratio of debt to equity, and an interest coverage test. Reduction of
Grupo Mexico direct or indirect voting interest in the Company to less than a
majority would constitute an event of default under one of the financing
agreements. The Company was in compliance with the various loan covenants at
December 31, 2001. Included in other assets at December 31, 2001 and 2000 are
$86 million and $179 million, respectively, held in escrow accounts as
required by the Company loan agreements. The funds were released from escrow
as scheduled loan repayments were made.
The balance of capitalized debt issuance costs was $49 million in 2001, $83
million in 2000 and $103 million in 1999. Amortization charged to interest
expense was $54 million, $22 million and $22 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999
respectively.                                       A42
14. Benefit Plans
The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering salaried
employees in the United States and certain employees in Peru. Benefits are based
on salary and years of service. The Company funding policy is to contribute
amounts to the plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set
forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such
additional amounts as the Company may determine to be appropriate. Plan assets
are invested in commingled stock and bond funds.
Effective October 31, 2000 the Board of Directors amended the pension plan to
suspend the accrual of benefits.

Post-retirement Benefits The post-retirement health care plan for retired salaried employees eligible for
Medicare was adopted by the Company on May 1, 1996. Secondary coverage under the
Company plan is available for all retired salaried employees who permanently
reside in the United States and who contribute amounts as defined by the plan.
The plan is unfunded.
Effective October 31, 2000, the health care plan for retirees was terminated and
the Company informed retirees that they would be covered by the post-retirement
health care plan of ASARCO Incorporated, which offers substantially the same
benefits and requires the same contributions.

Weighted-Average Assumptions
Discount rate                                     725%        775 The annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits
i.e., health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 10% for 2002. This rate
decreases 1% per year until it reaches 5% in 2007. The health care cost trend
rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example,
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point
would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation costs for 2001
by $01 million and the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit would have an insignificant change. Decreasing the
assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would
decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for 2001 by $01
million and the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit costs would have an insignificant change.                                       A45
Employee Savings Plan The Company maintained an employee savings plan for employees working in the
United States and expatriate employees in Peru, which permits employees to make
contributions by payroll deduction pursuant to section 401k of the Internal
Revenue Code. The plan provided for a Company matching contribution equal to 50%
of the first 6% of employee contributions. In connection with the required
match, the Company contributions charged against earnings were $002 million
and $01 million in the years 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Effective November 15, 2000 the savings plan was terminated and no further
contributions from employees or the Company were accepted after that date. The
plan received a final letter of determination from the Internal Revenue Service
and is proceeding with the distribution of assets to plan participants.

Stock Options The Company has two stockholder approved plans, a Stock Incentive Plan and a
Directors' Stock Award Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting
of nonqualified or incentive stock options, as defined under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as for the award of restricted stock
and bonuses payable in stock. The price at which options may be granted under
the Stock Incentive Plan shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of
the common stock on the date of grant in the case of incentive stock options, or
50% in the case of other options. In general, options are not exercisable for
six months and expire after 10 years from the date of grant.
Options granted may provide for Stock Appreciation Rights SAR. A SAR permits
an optionee, in lieu of exercising the option, to receive from the Company
payment of an amount equal to the difference between the market value of the
stock on the date of election of the SAR and the purchase price of the stock
under the terms of the option.
The authorized number of shares under the Stock Incentive Plan is 1,000,000 of
which 300,000 may be awarded as restricted stock. At December 31, 2001, 645,060
shares are available for future grants under this plan 645,060 shares at
December 31, 2000. The weighted average remaining contractual life of stock
option outstanding as of December 31, 2001 was 51 years.                                       A46
The Directors' Stock Award Plan provides that directors who are not compensated
as employees of the Company will be automatically awarded 200 shares of common
stock upon election and 200 additional shares following each annual meeting of
stockholders thereafter. Under the directors' plan, 100,000 shares have been
reserved for awards. At December 31, 2001, 20,000 have been awarded under this
plan.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for awards under the stock incentive plan. If compensation cost
for the Company Stock Incentive Plan had been determined based on the fair
value at the grant date for awards in 2001, 2000 and 1999, consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in millions, except per share amounts                    2001      2000      1999

Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for

interest rate of 48%; and expected life of 71 years. There were no options
granted in 2001 and 2000.

16. Related Party Transactions
Grupo Mexico, the majority 542%indirect stockholder of the Company and its
affiliates, provide various support services to the Company. In 2001, these
activities were principally related to accounting, legal, tax, financial,
treasury, human resources, price risk assessment and hedging, purchasing,
procurement and logistics, sales, and administrative support services. Grupo
Mexico is reimbursed for these support services. The total amount paid by the
Company to Grupo Mexico for such services in 2001 and 2000 was $7 million in
each year. In 1999, the Company paid $08 million to ASARCO, a 542% stockholder
at the time, for tax, treasury, and administrative support services provided to
the Company.
The Class A Common Stockholders and/or their affiliates, purchase copper
products from the Company from time to time at prices determined on an
arm-length basis by reference to the LME and COMEX market price for copper at
such time. Management believes these transactions to be on terms as favorable as
could be obtained from unaffiliated parties. The Company expects that its policy
of determining prices for related party transactions on an arm-length basis by
reference to the LME or COMEX market prices for copper at the time of any such
transaction will be continued.
Minera Mexico Internacional, Inc., a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico and ASARCO
purchased copper products from SPCC during 2001 in the amounts of $104 million
and $263 million in 2000. ASARCO had no purchases from SPCC in 1999.
Additionally, in 2001, the Company purchased from ASARCO ten used 200-ton Le
Torneau haulage trucks for the Toquepala mine for a total purchase price of $52
million, including spare parts. In compliance with Peruvian regulations related
to the importation of used vehicles, the trucks were independently appraised at
fair market value at the time of the purchase.
Phelps Dodge Refining Corporation, affiliate of Phelps Dodge and Phelps Dodge
Corporation, affiliated companies of a shareholder of SPCC, purchased $03
million of copper products from the Company in 2001. They had purchases of $683
million in 2000 and had no purchases in 1999.
Cerro Wire and Cable Co., and other affiliated companies of The Marmon Group,
Inc., an affiliated company of one of the shareholders of SPCC, purchased $181
million of copper products from the Company in 2001. They had purchases of $132
million in 2000 and had no purchases in 1999.
The Company contracted an aggregate of approximately $22 million, $78 million,
and $83 million, in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for shipping services to
and from Peru by Compania Sud-Americana de Vapores, S.A. CSAV, and a
subsidiary company. CSAV is a company indirectly controlled by Quemchi, S.A. Mr.
Jaime Claro is Vice Chairman of Electro and Quemchi, S.A., and his direct and
indirect family interests in both companies exceed 10%. Mr. Claro is also
Chairman of Chilean Line Inc., which is the agent for and is owned by CSAV.
The Company believes that the foregoing transactions were entered into on
arm-length basis on terms as favorable as could be obtained from other third
parties. It is anticipated that in the future the Company will enter into
similar transactions with the same parties.                                       A48
As of December 31, 2001, the Company had receivables of $87 million and $86
million related to sales of copper in the years 2000 and 2001 to ASARCO and
Minera Mexico International Inc. MMI, respectively. Also as of such date, the
Company had receivables of $08 million, related to the purchase of concentrates
in the year 2001 made from Mexicana de Cobre MC, resulting from the final
liquidation of the sale. Of those amounts, receivables of $80 million, $59
million and $08 million from ASARCO, MMI and MC, respectively, were due on
December 31, 2001. Additionally, receivables of $07 million due from ASARCO and
$27 million due from MMI will mature in March 2002.
As of March 8, 2002 the Company had collected $52 million, $36 million and
$08 million from ASARCO, MMI and MC, respectively. ASARCO and MMI each have
agreed with the Company that they will pay the outstanding balances of $35
million and $50 million before June 30, 2002, or in the future through a
reduction in dividends and management fees.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a payable to ASARCO of $20 million
related to the purchase of the used haulage trucks, account that formed part of
the collection of March 8, 2002 mentioned above.
17. Concentration of Risk
The Company operates two copper mines; a smelter and two refineries in Peru and
substantially all of its assets are located there. There can be no assurances
that the Company operations and assets that are subject to the jurisdiction of
the Government of Peru may not be adversely affected by future actions of such
government. Substantially all of the Company products are exported from Peru
to customers principally in Europe, Asia, South America and the United States.
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to a concentration
of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable
securities and trade accounts receivable.
The Company invests or maintains available cash with various high-quality banks,
principally in the U.S., Canada and Peru, or in commercial paper of highly rated
companies. As part of its cash management process, the Company regularly
monitors the relative credit standing of these institutions, and by policy,
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution. At December 31,
2001, the Company had invested 4498% of its cash equivalents and marketable
securities with Peruvian banks, out of which 3465% was invested with one
institution.
During the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its
customers. Although the receivables resulting from these transactions are not
collateralized, the Company has not experienced significant problems with the
collection of receivables.
The largest ten trade receivable balances accounted for 736% of the trade
accounts receivable at December 31, 2001, of which one customer represented
173%.
18. Commitments and Contingencies
In September 1996, the Company announced a two-stage project, which includes an
expansion of the Cuajone mine and an expansion and modernization of the copper
smelter at Ilo. At present, total capital cost for this project is estimated at
$870 million, budgeted to be spent through the year 2006.
The Cuajone mine expansion was completed in 1999. Additional equipment was
received during year 2000.                                       A49
The second stage of the program, the expansion and modernization of the Ilo
smelter is expected to be completed by the year 2006 at an estimated cost of
$672 million.
As a result of the expansion program, electric power requirements will increase
significantly, requiring the construction of substantial additional generating
capacity. In 1997, the Company sold its existing power plant to an independent
power company for $336 million. In connection with the sale, a power purchase
agreement was also completed, under which the Company agreed to purchase its
power needs for twenty years commencing in 1997.
Environmental Company activities are subject to Peruvian laws and regulations. SPCC submitted
in 1996 the Environmental Compliance and Management Plan known by its Spanish
acronym, PAMA to the Peruvian Government as part of such regulations. The PAMA
included all current operations that did not have an approved environmental
impact study at the time. SPCC PAMA was approved in January 1997 and it
contains 34 mitigation measures and projects necessary to bring the existing
operations to the established environmental standards. By the end of 2001,
twenty-five of such projects were already completed.
The Smelter Expansion and Modernization Project represents the largest and most
significant project the Company will undertake under the PAMA.
The Company continued the detailed feasibility studies for the Ilo smelter
modernization and expansion project. The goal is to introduce the most efficient
technology, proven in other metallurgical facilities, looking not only to comply
with Peruvian environmental standards but also to provide economic and financial
returns.
The Company is expecting a proposal from AUSMELT, an Australian company, to be
evaluated together with the other two proposals received, from Mitsui and from
Kvaerner. The two options under consideration comply with the Company
requirements. That is, to employ proven technology that will provide both a good
economic return and exceed the requirements of current environmental
regulations. The alternatives may provide an opportunity to increase the
smelter capacity to 183 million tons and improve SO2 capture to more than the
PAMA 92% requirement. The project is scheduled to commence later in the year
if the proper conditions are met, including obtaining the required financing.
Starting in November of 1995, Southern Peru established and continues to operate
the Supplementary Control Program SCP, a voluntary effort, by which the
smelter production is curtailed during periods of adverse meteorological
conditions. For the year 2001, in conjunction with the operation of the
smelter sulfuric acid plant that produced over 355,000 tons, this program has
contributed to improve air quality in Ilo. In addition to the environmental
programs dealing with air quality issues, the Company continues to have good
results with the remediation programs in both the Ite bay and the slag removal
program on the beaches to the north of the smelter.
In 2001, SPCC submitted to the government the Spill Response Plans for the three
operating areas. Both ocean and land response equipment were purchased, and
personnel training will continue during 2002.
Environmental capital expenditures for the period 1997-2001 exceeded $145
million. As soon as the Smelter Expansion and Modernization project begins, the
Company foresees significant environmental capital expenditures starting in
2002. Approximately $80 million have been budgeted for the smelter project in
2002.                                       A50
Litigation In April 1996, the Company was served with a complaint filed in Peru by
approximately 800 former employees, for unspecified amounts, seeking the
delivery of substantial number of investment shares formerly called labor
shares of its Peruvian Branch plus dividends. In October 1997, the Superior
Court of Lima nullified a decision of a court of first instance, which had been
adverse to the Company. The Superior Court remanded the case for a new trial.
Plaintiffs filed an extraordinary appeal before the Peruvian Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court may grant discretionary review in limited cases. In March 1999,
the Company received official notification that the Superior Court had denied
plaintiffs' extraordinary appeal and affirmed the decision of the Supreme Court
of Lima, which remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings. In
December 1999, the lower court decided against the Company, ordering the
delivery of the investment shares and dividends to the plaintiffs. The Company
appealed this decision in January 2000. On October 10, 2000, the Superior Court
of Lima affirmed the lower court decision, which had been adverse to the
Company. On appeal by the Company, the Peruvian Supreme Court annulled the
proceedings noting that the civil courts lacked jurisdiction and that the matter
had to be decided by a labor court. The case is now pending before a labor court
of first instance in Lima.
There is also pending against the Company a similar lawsuit filed by 127
additional former employees, for unspecified amounts. In the third quarter of
1997, the court of first instance dismissed their complaint. Upon appeal filed
by the plaintiffs, the Superior Court of Lima, in the third quarter of 1998,
nullified the lower court decision on technical ground and remanded the case
to the lower court for further proceedings. In December 1999, the lower court
dismissed the complaint against the Company. Plaintiffs appealed this decision
in January 2000 before the Superior Court. By the end of year 2000 the Superior
Court rejected the appeal. Plaintiffs have filed an extraordinary appeal before
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court may grant discretionary review in limited
cases.
In February 2002, the Company received notice that approximately 3,000
additional former employees intended to file a similar lawsuit, for unspecified
amounts, seeking the delivery of a substantial number of investment shares. The
Company does not have sufficient information to assess the merits of this new
claim but intends to challenge its validity.
On December 28, 2000, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the federal
court in New York City. The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages for alleged personal injuries to eight persons resident in Peru arising
from alleged releases into the environment from Company operations in Peru.
The lawsuit is similar to a suit filed in 1995 in Texas, for unspecified
amounts, which was dismissed in 1996 by a U. S. district judge. That ruling was
affirmed unanimously by a three-judge federal appeals court. The court made it
clear that the claims of Peruvian residents should be tried in the courts of
Peru, not in the United States.
It is the opinion of management that the outcome of the legal proceedings
mentioned, as well as other miscellaneous litigation and proceedings now
pending, will not materially adversely affect the financial position of the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, it is possible that
litigation matters could have a material effect on quarterly or annual operating
results, when they are resolved in future periods.                                       A51
