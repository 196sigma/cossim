REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS Board of Directors
Clarify Inc.
San Jose, California
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Clarify Inc. as of December
31, 1995 and 1996 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Clarify Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                     COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

CLARIFY INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY
Clarify Inc. and subsidiaries the Company, a Delaware corporation, was
founded in August 1990 to develop, market and support adaptable client/server
application software designed to address the external and internal service,
support, and product quality needs of today global enterprises. The Company
markets its software and services primarily through its direct sales
organization and focuses on large enterprises with complex requirements.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation
-  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
-  The Company considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original or remaining maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase
to be cash equivalents.
Investments
-  All investments are classified as available-for-sale and therefore are carried
at fair market value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on such investments
are reported net of related taxes as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of such investments are reported in
earnings and computed using the specific identification cost method.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- 
Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other
accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Based
on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar
terms, the carrying values of notes payable and capital lease obligations
approximate fair value. Estimated fair values for investments are determined
using quoted market prices for those securities or similar financial
instruments.
Concentrations
-  Cash and cash equivalents and investments are custodied with several major
financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may generally be redeemed
upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk.
The Company customer base is dispersed across many different geographic
areas throughout the United States, Europe and Asia and consists principally of
companies in the networking equipment, high-end software, telecommunications and
computer systems industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and maintains an allowance for potential credit losses.
Collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, is generally not
required.
36
Revenue Recognition
-  License fee revenues consist of revenues from initial licenses for the
Company products, sales of licenses to existing customers for additional users
of the Company products and fees from sublicenses of third party software
products. The Company recognizes initial license fee revenues only after
delivery and installation of software products, if there are no remaining
significant post-installation obligations and if collection is deemed probable.
If significant post-installation obligations exist or if a product is subject to
customer acceptance, revenues are deferred until no significant obligations
remain or, until acceptance has occurred. Sales of additional licenses to the
Company existing customers are recognized upon shipment. Service revenues
consist primarily of maintenance, consulting and training revenues. Maintenance
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the support period, which is
typically twelve months. Consulting and training revenues generally are
recognized when the services are performed.
Product Development and Engineering Expenditures
- 
Costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to
product development and engineering expenses as incurred. Software development
costs are capitalized beginning when a product technological feasibility has
been established and ending when a product is available for general release to
customers. Generally, the Company products are released soon after
technological feasibility has been established. As a result, the Company has not
capitalized any software development costs since such costs have not been
significant.
Property and Equipment
-  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
generally three to five years. Assets under capital leases and leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of
the lease. Upon disposal, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the Company accounts, and the resulting gains or losses are
reflected in the statement of operations.
Income Taxes
-  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. The Company is required to adjust its
deferred tax liabilities in the period when tax rates or the provisions of the
income tax laws change. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Computation of Net Income Loss Per Share
- 
Net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period.
Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of convertible preferred stock, common
stock subject to repurchase, stock options and warrants. Pursuant to Securities
and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 83, common equivalent
shares issued by the Company during the twelve months preceding the initial
public offering date, using the treasury stock method and the assumed public
offering price per share, have been included in the calculation of net income
loss per share for all periods presented prior to the initial public offering
date. Pro forma net income loss per share assumes the common shares issuable
upon conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock, which were
excluded during the loss period, were outstanding for such period.
Foreign Currency Translation
-  The functional currency for the majority of the Company foreign operations
is the applicable local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign
currency to U.S. dollars is performed for balance
37
sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet
date and for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted average exchange
rate during the period. Adjustments resulting from such translation are
reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains or losses
resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of
operations.
Use of Estimates
-  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation
-  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, encourages but does not require companies to record
compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans at fair value. The Company
has chosen to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic
value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the
excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the Company stock at the date of
the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock.
Reclassifications
-  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform to
current classifications.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
- 
During February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 128, Earnings per Share, SFAS 128 which specifies the computation,
presentation and disclosure requirements for Earnings Per Share. SFAS 128 will
become effective for the Company 1997 fiscal year. The impact of adopting
SFAS 128 on the Company financial statements has not yet been determined.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATION
In April 1996, the Company acquired Metropolis Software, Inc. Metropolis, a
sales force automation software provider. The Company issued approximately
663,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for substantially all of the
shares of Metropolis. The Company also assumed stock options that converted
into options to purchase approximately 77,000 shares of the Company common

the consolidated financial statements have been restated as if Metropolis had
been combined for all periods presented.

Stock Split
-  On September 14, 1995, the Company effected a reverse stock split of two for
three to be effective prior to the effective date of the initial public
offering. All shares and per share data in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse
stock split.
On September 18, 1996 the Company Board of Directors authorized a two-for-
one stock split payable in the form of a dividend of one additional share of the
Company common stock for each share owned by shareholders of record on
September 30, 1996. All share and per share information in the accompanying
financial statements has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the
stock split for all periods presented.
Initial Public Offering and Conversion of Preferred Stock
- 
In November 1995, the Company issued 4,600,000 shares of Common Stock in an
initial public offering. In connection with the initial public offering, all
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock were converted into an aggregate of
approximately 11,117,000 shares of Common Stock and the number of authorized
Preferred Stock was reduced from 10,000,000 shares to 5,000,000 shares.
Additionally, approximately 155,000 shares of Common Stock were issued upon the
net exercise of warrants for preferred stock.
Employee Stock-Based Compensation Plans
- 
1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
At December 31, 1996, approximately 2,590,000 shares of common stock were
authorized for issuance under the Company 1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan the 1995 Plan which serves as the successor equity incentive program to
the Company 1991 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1991 Plan. The 1995
Plan will terminate on September 13, 2005, unless sooner terminated by the Board
of Directors.
The 1995 Plan is divided into three separate components: i the Discretionary
Option Grant Program under which eligible individuals may, at the discretion of
the Plan Administrator, be granted incentive or non-statutory stock options to
purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than 85% of their
fair market value on the grant date, ii the Stock Issuance Program under which
individuals may, at the Plan Administrator discretion, be issued shares of
common stock directly either by the purchase of such shares at a price not less
than 85% of their fair market value at the time of issuance or in consideration
of the past performance of services and iii the Automatic Option Grant program
under which non-statutory stock option grants will be automatically made at
periodic intervals to eligible non-employee Board members to purchase shares of
common stock at an exercise price equal to 100% of their fair market value on
the grant date. Options are exercisable at times and in increments as specified
by the Plan Administrator and generally expire in seven to ten years.
The share reserve for the 1995 Plan automatically increases on the first
trading day in each of the 1996 and 1997 calendar years by the number of shares
equal to five percent of the total number of shares of the Company common and
common stock equivalents outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding
calendar year.

At December 31, 1996, approximately 1,274,000 shares of outstanding options
were exercisable. In addition, approximately 279,000 shares of common stock
issued under the 1991 Plan were subject to repurchase.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
At December 31, 1996, the Company had reserved a total of 870,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP.
The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company with a
means of acquiring common stock of the Company through payroll deductions. The
purchase price of such stock under the ESPP cannot be less than 85% of the lower
of the fair market value on the semi-annual purchase dates. Payroll deductions
may not exceed 15% of total cash earnings for each semi-annual period.
Employees may end their participation in the offering at any time during the
offering period, and participation ends automatically on termination of
employment with the Company. During 1996, approximately 289,000 shares were
sold through the ESPP.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. If compensation cost for the 1995 Plan and the ESPP had been
determined based on the fair value on the grant dates for awards in 1995 and
1996 consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below in thousands                               1995    1996

Earnings per share        As reported.  $ 009   $ 038
Pro forma.  $ 007   $ 030 
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes options-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1995 and 1996, respectively: no expected
dividends; expected volatility of 55% 0% for the period prior to the IPO;
weighted average risk-free interest rate of 6%; and expected life of 4 years.
The fair value of employees' stock purchase rights under the ESPP was
estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for 1995
and 1996, respectively: no expected dividends; expected volatility of 55 weighted average risk-free interest rate of 6%; and expected life of one year.

Pro forma net income reflects only options granted in 1995 and 1996. 
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost under SFAS 123 is 
not reflected in the pro forma amounts presented above because compensation cost
is reflected over the options' vesting period of generally five years and 
compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not 
considered.

The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance for those deferred tax
assets that management believes are more likely than not to be realized through
taxable income in the carryback period or through future taxable income.
The Company income taxes currently payable for both federal and state
purposes have been reduced by the tax benefit derived from the disqualifying
dispositions of incentive stock options and the exercise of nonqualified stock
options. The benefit, which totaled $4,171,000 in 1996, was credited directly to
additional paid-in capital.
At December 31, 1996 the composition of tax carryforwards is as follows in
thousands                         Federal   State 
Net operating loss carryforward.  $ 4,914   $ 68

The federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire between
1998 and 2009 for both federal and state income tax purposes if not used before
such time to offset future taxable income or taxes payable.
12. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company operates in a single industry segment encompassing the design,
development, marketing and technical support for front office automation
software.
In 1994, one customer accounted for 12% of total revenues. In 1995, one
customer accounted for approximately 10% of total revenues.  No one customer
accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in 1996.
International sales, primarily in Europe, Canada, Mexico and the Pacific
region, were insignificant in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, international sales
accounted for approximately 15% of total revenue.
13. RETIREMENT PLAN
Effective August 1991, the Company began a voluntary 401k plan covering
substantially all employees. The plan provides for discretionary employer
contributions. No employer contributions were made or authorized in 1994, 1995
or 1996.
