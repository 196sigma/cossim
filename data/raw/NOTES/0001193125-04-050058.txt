SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  NOTE ADESCRIPTION OF
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS  SRI/Surgical Express, Inc.
SRI or the Company provides central processing and supply chain management services to hospitals and surgery centers across the United States. The Company offers a combination of disposable surgical products and
high-quality reusable products including gowns, towels, drapes, and basins, out-sourced instrument processing services and a comprehensive case cart management system. At ten regional facilities, the Company collects, sorts, cleans, inspects,
packages, sterilizes and delivers its reusable products on a just-in-time basis. The Company operates in a single industry segment.  NOTE BSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Financial Statement Presentation  The Company operates on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending the Sunday nearest December 31. The financial statements reflect the Companys year-end as of
December 31 for presentation purposes. There were 52 weeks included for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001.  Basis of Presentation  In December 2002, the Company acquired 100% of the interests in SRI Realty Trust, Inc. Realty Trust from an unrelated third party for
approximately $881,000. At December 31, 2002, the financial statements included the accounts of the Company and Realty Trust. In 2003, Realty Trust was dissolved as a legal entity and its net assets were transferred to the Company.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.  Accounts Receivable, Net
The Company has accounts receivable from hospitals and
surgery centers. The Company does not believe that there are substantial credit risks associated with those receivables. The Company does not require any form of collateral from the hospitals and surgery centers. The allowance for doubtful accounts
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $125,000 and $101,000, respectively. The Companys write-offs for uncollectable accounts are insignificant to its results of operations. The Company does not customarily charge interest on
accounts receivable.  Concentration of Credit Risk  For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, revenues from three
hospital groups Novation, Premier Inc. and HPG collectively accounted for approximately 59%, 59%, and 60% of the Companys revenues, respectively. No single hospital or surgery center accounted for more than 80% of the Companys
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 
24 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Inventories, Net  Inventories, consisting principally of consumables, supplies, and disposable surgical products, are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being
determined on the first-in, first-out method. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, inventory consists of the following:  December 31 2003 2002 Raw materials 2,812,150 3,453,313 Work in progress 150,917 81,211 Finished goods 3,322,289 3,652,355 6,285,356 7,186,879 Inventory reserve 255,053 210,299 6,030,303 6,976,580  Reusable Surgical Products, Net
Reusable surgical products are stated at cost.
Amortization is computed on a basis similar to the units of production method. Estimated useful lives are based on the estimated total number of available uses for each product. The expected total available usage for its products using the three
principal fabrics accounting for 85% of its products is 75, 100, and 125 uses based on several factors. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $133 million and $138 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had reserves for shrinkage,
obsolescence and scrap of approximately $882,000 and $10 million, respectively.  Property, Plant and Equipment, Net  Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed by the straight-line method with a half-year convention over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or for leasehold improvements for the term of the related
leases.  Goodwill, Net  Goodwill of approximately $52 million arising from acquisitions, net of
approximately $774,000 of accumulated amortization, is stated at cost. Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill had been amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from twenty to thirty years.  The Company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. Under this standard, the Company is required to perform a goodwill impairment test at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. The Company completed the annual impairment test utilizing a qualified independent appraiser during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and
determined that no impairment existed. Recoverability of goodwill is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair market value, based on projected undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill is
considered impaired and a second test using discounted cash flows is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The Company has not recognized any impairment of its goodwill for any of the years presented. Goodwill is no longer
amortized, but must be written down when impaired.

The following table presents the impact on net income and earnings per share had the standard been in
effect for the year ended December 31, 2001 in thousands:  YearEnded December31,2001

Effect of goodwill amortization, net of taxes 002 Adjusted earnings per common share, diluted 078  Revenue Recognition 
Revenues are recognized as the agreed upon products and services are
delivered, generally daily. A packing slip and a randomly generated delivery confirmation signed and dated by our customer evidence delivery of product. The Companys contractual relationships with its customers are primarily evidenced
by purchase orders or service agreements with terms varying from one to five years, which are generally cancelable by either party.  The Company owns substantially all of the reusable surgical products provided to customers. A third party provides the reusable surgical instruments that
are included in the comprehensive surgical procedure-based delivery and retrieval service and receives a fee from SRI. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No. 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net
as an Agent, the Company has concluded that it is acting as a principal in this arrangement and has reported the revenue gross for the comprehensive surgical procedure-based delivery and retrieval service. The third party agent fee charged to
the Company is included in cost of revenues in the statements of operations.  Advertising  Costs associated with advertising
are charged to expense as incurred. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, advertising costs of approximately $210,000, $11,000 and $3,000, respectively, were charged to selling and administrative expenses in the
Companys statements of operations.  Income Taxes
Income taxes have been provided using the liability
method in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be 
26 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rate is recognized in operations in the period that includes
the enactment date of the rate change.  Fair Value of Financial
Instruments  The carrying amounts of cash and cash
equivalents approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. The fair value of notes payable to bank and bonds payable approximate the carrying amount as the interest rates are based on market interest rates.  Derivative Instruments  In connection with certain operating leases entered into by the Company see Notes E and F, certain interest rate swaps
were entered into in May and June 1999. The interest rate swaps had a fair market value of $589,000 at December 31, 2001. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, on January
1, 2001 by recognizing a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of a loss of $113,000, which is net of tax of $69,000. The Company recognized an unrealized loss of $407,000 in 2001 and an unrealized gain of $101,000 in 2002, prior to
the termination of the interest rate swaps in April 2002.  The
Company does not have any derivative instruments as of December 31, 2003 or 2002.  Earnings loss Per Share  Basic earnings
loss per share is calculated by dividing net income loss available for common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing net income
loss by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period. The number of potential common shares takes into account the dilutive effect of outstanding options, calculated using the treasury stock
method.  Exit or Disposal Activities  During the second quarter of 2003, the Company closed its Boston service
center when service was terminated to the Companys sole customer in that market. The Company recognized exit costs totaling approximately $104,000 related to employee termination costs, contract termination costs, and inventory obsolescence to
close this service center. Approximately eight production employees worked through the completion of the consolidation and received severance and benefits. The Company subleased the building to an unrelated third party for the remainder of the lease
term.  During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the
Company consolidated the operations of its Detroit facility into its Cincinnati facility. The Detroit facility was converted into a service center that distributes products to customers in that market. The Company recognized exit costs totaling
approximately $92,000 for employee severance and benefit costs and equipment impairment during 2003 in this consolidation. Approximately 45 production employees worked through the completion of the consolidation and received severance and benefits.
Stock-based compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. In 1995, the Financial 
27 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under Statement 123,
the Company may elect to recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards or continue to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25, and disclose in the financial statements the effects of Statement 123 as if
the recognition provisions were adopted.  Recently issued accounting
standards  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 relates to the accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets, including leased properties. The Company adopted SFAS 143 effective January 1,
2003. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets SFAS 144 establishes methods of
accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets not being amortized. The Company adopted SFAS 144 effective January 1, 2002. SFAS 144 distinguishes between long-lived assets to be held and
used, long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale. Historically, and as of the date of adoption, all of the Companys assets were classified as assets to be held and used. The adoption
of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146 relates to the
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, including those undertaken in the course of a restructuring. Specifically, SFAS 146 requires that a liability for such costs be recognized when the liability is incurred
rather than at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit plan. SFAS 146 also establishes that fair value should be used for the initial measurement of liabilities recorded in association with exit or disposal activities. The Company adopted
SFAS 146 effective January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 146 impacted the timing of the recognition of the costs and liabilities resulting from the disposal and exits plans initiated in 2003. See Exit or Disposal Activities.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,
Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, an amendment of SFAS No. 123 SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require more frequent disclosures in the financial statements regarding the effects of stock-based
compensation. SFAS 148 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002, including certain amendments to required disclosures related to stock-based compensation included in condensed financial statements for
interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS 148 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The Company does not plan to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation in the foreseeable
future; therefore this standard will not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The Interpretation also requires that upon issuance of certain guarantees, the guarantor must recognize a
liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 were effective for interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The initial recognition and measurement provisions are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
28 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
FASB Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46 requires a
variable interest entity to be consolidated by the company that has a majority of the exposure to expected losses of the variable interest entity. The Interpretation was effective for variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The
adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 requires that certain freestanding financial instruments be classified
as liabilities, including mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, obligations to repurchase the issuers equity shares by transferring assets and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares. SFAS 150 was effective for
financial instruments entered into or modified subsequent to May 31, 2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred for an indefinite period the application of SFAS 150 until it could consider some of the resulting measurement and recognition
implementation issues. The Company does not anticipate that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Comprehensive Income  The Company accounts for all components of comprehensive income under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income SFAS 130, which requires that total comprehensive income and comprehensive earnings per share be disclosed with prominence equal to that of net income and earnings per share. Comprehensive income is defined as changes in
stockholders equity exclusive of transactions with owners such as capital contributions and dividends and specifically excluded items such as deferred compensation. The Company did not have any items of other comprehensive income on which to
report in any of the years presented.  Reclassifications  Certain 2002 employee salaries, benefits and related expenses have been
reclassified from cost of revenues into selling and administrative expenses in order to conform to the 2003 presentation.  NOTE CPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  Property, plant and equipment consist of the following:  UsefulLives InYears

NOTE DNOTES PAYABLE TO BANK  On June 26, 2003, the Company renewed and amended its existing revolving credit with Wachovia Bank and SouthTrust Bank.
Based on anticipated future needs, the Company elected to decrease the facility amount from $450 million to $300 million. The Companys outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility were approximately $70 million and $155 million
on December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, respectively.  The
credit facility is secured by substantially all of the Companys assets and has a scheduled maturity date of June 30, 2006. The facilitys interest rate varies between 200 and 350 basis points over LIBOR 376% as of December 31, 2003,
depending on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. The credit facility requires the Company to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than $450 million plus 75% of cumulative net income for each fiscal quarter beginning with the
fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2003; b a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 25 to 10 measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters then ended; and c a funds flow coverage ratio of not less than 25 to 10
measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. The credit facility restricts the Company from paying dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, encumbering its assets, and entering into merger, consolidation or liquidation transactions representing
greater than 100% of consolidated assets. The Company complied with all requirements of the credit facility as of December 31, 2003.  As of December 31, 2003, the Company had an additional amount of approximately $60 to 70 million available under its revolving credit facility. The
amount available under the revolving credit facility is limited by the consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 25 to 10 as of the end of each fiscal quarter.  The credit facility allows the Company to repurchase its stock through open market purchases at prevailing market prices.
During 2003, the Company repurchased 6,753 shares of its common stock, at an aggregate cost of approximately $36,000. During 2002, the Company repurchased 154,400 shares of its common stock, at an aggregate cost of approximately $948,000. During
2001, the Company repurchased 39,500 shares of its common stock, at an aggregate cost of approximately $569,000.  For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, interest expense was approximately $11 million, $10 million, and $14 million,
respectively. Interest expense in 2003, 2002, and 2001 included approximately $355,000, $352,000, and $247,000, respectively, of interest related to a capital lease.  NOTE EOPERATING LEASES  The Company leases offices, facilities, office equipment, and distribution vehicles under non-cancelable operating leases with terms ranging from one year
to ten years. The office and processing facility leases contain various renewal options and escalating payments. At present, the Company intends to exercise certain aspects of these renewal options when the initial terms expire. The vehicle leases
contain contingent rentals based on mileage.  Future minimum
lease payments as of December 31, 2003 are as follows:  Year ending December 31

Rental expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled approximately $43
million, $46 million, and $44 million including contingent rentals of approximately $278,000, $296,000, and $287,000, respectively.  NOTE FBONDS PAYABLE  Since their initial construction in 1999, the Company had leased two of its processing facilities through a form of off-balance sheet financing in which a
third party Realty Trust purchased the properties and leased the assets to the Company as lessee.  In December 2002, the Company acquired 100 percent of the interest in Realty Trust, thereby eliminating the operating lease treatment and the off-balance
sheet financing. When that transaction was consummated, SRI consolidated the accounts of Realty Trust which included approximately $106 million in processing facilities property, plant and equipment, and $97 million in liabilities, primarily
related to the bonds that financed the processing facilities.  In 2003, the Company became the 100% owner of the assets and liabilities related to these processing facilities when SRI Realty Trust was dissolved as a legal entity.  The Company finances these facilities through letters of credits issued by Wachovia Bank. Interest expense adjusts based on
rates that approximate LIBOR 126% at December 31, 2003. Starting in 2004, the Company will begin amortizing the bonds through quarterly payments of $165,000. Balloon principal payments of $31 million on the bonds are due in 2014. The Bonds are
collateralized by the two processing facilities.  In 2003, the
Company recorded depreciation expense and interest expense of approximately $640,000 and $126,000, respectively, related to the bonds and letter of credit financing, which replaced the lease expense under the operating lease which was recorded in
the statement of operations in 2002 and 2001.  As of December
31, 2003, the Company has no off-balance sheet financing.  Bond
maturities as of December 31, 2003 for the next five years are as follows:  Year ending December 31

CONTINGENCIES  Capital Lease  The Company accounts for the lease of its Tampa, Florida corporate office as
a capital lease. The term of the lease is 20 years commencing March 24, 2001. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had approximately $56 million and $60 million respectively net of accumulated depreciation of approximately 
31 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
$803,000 and $468,000 as of December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively of buildings and leasehold improvements related to the corporate office. The building
and improvements are included in property, plant and equipment see Note C. The related liability of $45 million is recorded in obligation under capital lease in the balance sheets.  Future minimum lease payments related to this capital lease as of December 31, 2003 are as follows:  Year ending December 31 2004 478,200 2005 478,200 2006 478,200 2007 478,200 2008 478,200 Thereafter 5,817,500 Total 8,208,500 Less: amount representing interest 3,693,800 Obligation under capital lease 4,514,700  The annual lease
amount is adjusted every other year by a factor of 404% to 816% depending on the consumer price index. The Company has the option to purchase the building at fair value at any time prior to March, 2006.  Contractual Obligations  We offer instruments pursuant to our Joint Marketing Agreement with Aesculap, Inc. Under the terms of this agreement,
Aesculap furnishes and repairs all of the surgical instruments that we deliver to customers and receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure. The Company also has a procurement agreement with Standard Textile under which the Company agrees to
purchase 90% of its reusable surgical products from Standard Textile through August 2008.  The Companys management believes that Aesculap and Standard Textiles prices are and will be comparable to prices available from other vendors. Standard Textiles President and Chief Executive Officer
was a director of the Company from August 1998 until May 2001. If Aesculap or Standard Textile were unable to perform under these procurement agreements, the Company would need to obtain alternate sources for its reusable surgical products.
The Company is not bound to purchase any minimum quantity of
products under these agreements, however, the Company expects to make payments under them to fulfill its requirements. The Company estimates that its payments under these agreements will be between $150 and $170 million in 2004. Amounts in
subsequent years will be comparable, adjusted by changes in the Companys customer demand, amortization rates, product prices, and other variables affecting its business. During 2003, 2002, and 2001 the Company purchased products in the amounts
of $24 million, $47 million, and $55 million, respectively, from Standard Textile. During 2003, 2002, and 2001 the Company incurred fees of $55 million, $31 million, and $20 million, respectively, to Aesculap for instrument usage. 
Management Incentive Plan  The Company has a Management Incentive Plan, the incentives of which are
based on various performance factors and are adjusted to reflect the Companys overall performance as determined by the Board of Directors. 
32 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Payment of the cash incentives is made at the middle of the third month after the end of the incentive year. The participant must still be an employee of the
Company at that time. Approximately $195,000, $160,000, and $193,000 of incentives were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.  Management Employment Agreements  The Company has an employment agreement with one executive that provides for payment of one years base salary and a pro-rated bonus as severance if
the executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company. The executive is prohibited from competing with the Company during the two-year period following termination of his employment.  The Company has an employment agreement with another executive that provides for him to receive a severance compensation
benefit equal to a his annual salary for 180 days for an involuntary termination before a change in control and, b two times his annual cash compensation payable in a lump sum and a pro-rated bonus for an involuntary or
constructive termination of employment following a change of control.  NOTE HINCOME TAX  The provisions for

the Company has a federal alternative minimum tax AMT credit carry-forward of approximately $100,000 and state tax credit carry-forward of approximately $549,000. The AMT credit carry-forward has no expiration. Approximately $49,000 of
the state tax credit carry-forward has a 15-year carry-forward limitation, which begin expiring in 2012. The remaining state tax credit carry-forward amounts have no expiration period.  SFAS 109 requires a valuation allowance to reduce reported deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the evidence, it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all the evidence, an allowance of $379,000 has been established at December 31, 2003 to reduce the deferred tax assets to the
amount that will more likely than not be realized. The change in valuation allowance for 2003 is $379,000, which is attributable to the limited ability of the Company to utilize its state tax credit carry-forward.  NOTE ISHAREHOLDERS EQUITY  Common Stock  Subject to preferences which might be applicable to the Companys outstanding Preferred Stock, the holders of the
Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. The Companys revolving credit facility restricts the Company from paying dividends see Note
D. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of the Company, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of any Preferred Stock
then outstanding. The Common Stock has no preemptive or conversion rights and is not subject to call or assessment by the Company. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. 
34 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Preferred Stock  The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $001 par value per share. The Board of Directors has the authority, without any
further vote or action by the Companys shareholders, to issue Preferred Stock in one or more series and to fix the number of shares, designations, relative rights including voting rights, preferences, and limitations of those series to the
full extent now or hereafter permitted by Florida law.  On
August 31, 1998, the Company acquired from Standard Textile all the outstanding common stock of Repak. Standard Textile received in this transaction 566,667 shares of the Companys Series A Preferred Stock, which was convertible by its holder
at any time into the same number of shares of the Companys Common Stock. Under certain conditions, including the Companys Common Stock having an average closing trading price of $1800 per share for a specified time period, the Series A
Preferred Stock was mandatorily convertible into the Companys Common Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock accrued a 2% dividend, payable quarterly, until the earlier of September 2004 or the date that it was converted into Common Stock. The
566,667 preferred shares were converted into the same number of shares of Common Stock in April 2001.  NOTE JSTOCK OPTIONS  The Company maintains three stock option plans, the 1995 Stock Option Plan, the 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan, and the 1998 Stock Option Plan.  The 1995 Stock Option Plan  The 1995 Stock Option Plan was designed to provide employees with incentive or non-qualified options to purchase up to 700,000 shares of Common Stock. The
options vest ratably over four to five years from the date of the grant. All outstanding options vest upon a change in control of the Company. Options granted under this Plan expire no later than ten years after the date granted or sooner in
the event of death, disability, retirement or termination of employment. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, options to purchase 392,500 and 436,400 shares, respectively, were outstanding, and 62,300 and 18,400 options, respectively, were available to
be granted under this Plan.  The 1998 Stock Option Plan
As amended on May 16, 2001, the 1998 Stock Option Plan is
designed to provide employees with incentive or non-qualified options to purchase up to 600,000 shares of Common Stock. The options vest ratably over four to five years from the date of the grant. All outstanding options vest upon a change in
control of the Company. Options granted under this Plan expire no later than ten years after the date granted or sooner in the event of death, disability, retirement, or termination of employment. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, options to
purchase 430,300 and 393,584 shares, respectively, were outstanding, and 152,284 and 189,400 options, respectively, were available to be granted under this Plan.  The Non-Employee Plan  As amended on May 16, 2001, the Non-Employee Plan is designed to provide for the grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase up to 200,000 shares of
Common Stock to members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of the Company. At the completion of its initial public offering, each non-employee director was granted options to purchase 4,000 shares of Common Stock for each full remaining
year of the directors term. Thereafter, on the date on which a new non-employee director is first elected or appointed, he or she is 
35 Table of Contents SRI/SURGICAL EXPRESS, INC.  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
automatically granted options to purchase 4,000 shares of Common Stock for each year of his or her initial term, and will be granted options to purchase
4,000 shares of Common Stock for each year of any subsequent term to which he or she is elected. All options become exercisable ratably over the directors term and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on
the date of grant. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, options to purchase 141,500 and 129,500 shares, respectively, were outstanding, and 58,500 and 70,500 options, respectively, were available to be granted under this Plan.  Other Stock Options  In October 1995, 66,000 non-qualified stock options were granted to a former officer and former director of the Company. The
options are fully vested, have an exercise price of $443 per share, and expire in October 2005.  In November 1997, 20,000 non-qualified stock options were granted to a former officer and former director of the Company, of which 8,000 shares were
forfeited. In 2002, the remaining 12,000 shares were exercised.  In December 2001, 10,000 non-qualified stock options were granted to each of the Companys three outside directors. The options vest ratably over three years and have an exercise price of $1537 per share.  If the Company had elected to recognize compensation expense based upon the
fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed by SFAS 123, the Companys net income loss and earnings loss per share would be reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and therefore the effect would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of 314,400 options for the year ended December 31, 2003, with an exercise price less than the average market
price of the common shares were not included because the effect would be anti-dilutive due to the Companys net loss for the year.  NOTE LSRI 401k PLAN  The Company sponsors the SRI/Surgical Express, Inc. 401k Plan the Plan, a defined contribution plan established under Section 401k of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Employees are eligible to contribute voluntarily to the Plan after six months of continued service, satisfying 1,000 hours of service, and attaining age 21. At its discretion, the Company may contribute 50% of the

contributions. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, the Companys expense related to the Plan was approximately $251,000, $105,000, and $106,000, respectively.  NOTE MRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid approximately $17,000, $39,000, and $187,000, respectively, to a company to

In July 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a settlement with respect to the Commissions investigation
of the Company. The settlement focused primarily on the Companys accounting for transactions underlying a restatement of the financial results for the third quarter of 2001.  In the settlement, without admitting or denying the Commissions findings, the Company and two of its former officers,
consented to an administrative cease and desist order regarding books and records, internal controls, and reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission did not assess any penalties or other monetary fines or make any
finding of fraud by the Company or the former officers. The two former officers retired from their position in December 2002 and they each remain directors of the Company. The settlement did not require any further restatement of the Companys
financial results for any period. The Commissions order notes the Companys full cooperation with the investigation.  Separately, the Commission approved a settlement with another former officer who left the Company in March 2002. Without admitting or denying the
allegations, the former officer consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10b and the books and records, internal controls, and reporting provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The judgment
imposed a $50,000 civil penalty against the former officer.  Class Action Litigation. In November 2003, the Company received court approval for the settlement and release of claims against the Company and certain former officers that were assessed in a Consolidated Amended Class Action
Complaint filed on June 4, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. This litigation consolidated substantially similar shareholders lawsuits filed against the Company and certain of its former officers
beginning on November 30, 2001, following its restatement of the financial results for the 2001 third quarter. The total settlement amount was $1,900,000, all of which was covered by insurance.

8 PART II  Item5. Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our filings
with the SEC.  We have also evaluated our internal controls for
financial reporting, and there have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that are reasonably likely to significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date we carried out our evaluation.  Any system of disclosure controls and internal controls, even if
well-conceived, is inherently limited in detecting and preventing all errors and fraud and provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect resource constraints, and we
must consider benefits of controls relative to their costs. Inherent limitations include the potential for faulty judgments in decision-making, breakdowns because of simple errors or mistakes, and circumvention of controls by individual acts,
collusion of two or more people, or management override of the controls.  We included certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as exhibits to this report as required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The foregoing information concerning our
evaluation of disclosure controls referenced in the Section 302 certifications should be read with the Section 302 certifications to more completely understand them.
