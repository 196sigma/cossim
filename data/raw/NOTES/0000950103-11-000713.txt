Item 5: Controls and procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures including those applicable to the Income Access Share Trust as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15e, as at December 31, 2010. The Companys management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature can provide only reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures including those applicable to the Income Access Share Trust are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the information that the Company is required to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f promulgated under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting including those applicable to the Income Access Share Trust as at December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its assessment, management believes that, as at December 31, 2010, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Deloitte LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, including those controls applicable to the Income Access Share Trust. This report appears on page F-3 of the Companys consolidated financial statements contained in : Exhibits and financial statement schedules of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Company has an integrated information system covering financial processes, production, logistics and quality management. Various upgrades and new implementations were made to the information system during 2010 and 2009. The Company reviewed each system change as it was implemented together with any internal controls affected. Alterations were made to affected controls at the time the system changes were implemented. Management believes that the controls as modified are appropriate and functioning effectively. Item1A.
