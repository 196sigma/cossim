ITEM 8:  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
OF COVENTRY HEALTH CARE, INC.       We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Coventry Health Care, Inc. a Delaware corporation and successor-in-interest to
Coventry Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Coventry Health
Care, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Baltimore, Maryland

Notes B and C to consolidated financial statements.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Interests of other investors in
the Company majority owned or otherwise effectively-controlled subsidiaries
are accounted for as minority interests and are included in other long-term
liabilities for financial reporting purposes.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents consist principally
of overnight repurchase agreements, money market funds, commercial paper and
certificates of deposit. The Company considers all highly liquid securities
purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents reported in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value.
Investments - The Company accounts for investments in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 SFAS 115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The Company considers
all of its investments as available-for-sale, and accordingly, records
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses on the sale of
these investments are determined on a specific identification basis.
Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less
than one year are classified as short-term investments and generally consist of
time deposits, U.S. Treasury Notes, and obligations of various states and
municipalities. Long-term investments have original maturities in excess of one
year and primarily consist of debt securities.                    40
43
Other Receivables - Other receivables include interest receivable,
reinsurance claims receivable, receivables from providers and suppliers and any
other receivables that do not relate to premiums.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives
of the related assets or, if shorter, over the terms of the respective leases.
Long-Lived Assets - The Company has adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121 SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. In accordance
with SFAS 121, the Company evaluates long-lived assets to be held for events or
changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. In making that determination, the Company considers a number of
factors, including undiscounted future cash flows, prior to interest expense.
The Company measures an impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the
assets to their carrying value. Fair values are determined by using market
prices for similar assets, if available, or discounted future estimated cash
flows, prior to interest expense. Assets held for sale are recorded at the lower
of the carrying amount or fair value, less any cost of disposition.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets - Goodwill and intangible assets consist
of costs in excess of the fair value of the net assets of subsidiaries or
operations acquired. Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over
periods ranging from 15 to 35 years. The remaining unamortized goodwill and
intangible asset balances at December 31, 1999 are as follows in thousands              ESTIMATED               ACCUMULATED

Total                      $336,640       $68,351        $268,289
Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and
1997 was approximately $146 million, $136 million and $38 million,
respectively. In accordance with SFAS 121 and Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No17, the Company periodically evaluates the realizability of
goodwill and intangible assets and the reasonableness of the related lives in
light of factors such as industry changes, individual market competitive
conditions, and operating income.
Other Assets - Other assets consist of loan acquisition costs, assets
related to the supplemental executive retirement plan See Note P to
consolidated financial statements, restricted assets, deferred charges and
certain costs incurred to develop new service areas and new products prior to
the initiation of revenues. Loan acquisition costs are amortized over the term
of the related debt while the other assets are amortized over their expected
periods of benefit, where applicable. Loan acquisition costs were fully
amortized in 1999. The preoperational new service area and new product costs
were amortized over their expected period of benefit up to eight years.
Effective April 1, 1997, the Company adopted a one-year period for amortization
of new service area and new product costs. $27 million of expense was included
in selling, general and administrative expense due to this change. These costs
were fully amortized at December 31, 1997. Accumulated amortization of other
assets was approximately $35 million and $34 million at December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively.
Medical Claims Liabilities - Medical claims liabilities consist of
actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services
incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are
based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization
statistics, and other related information. Although considerable variability is
inherent in such estimates, management believes that the liability is adequate.
The Company also establishes reserves, if required, for the probability that
anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the
group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and
reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually
monitored and reviewed, and as                    41
44
settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current
operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual
experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term.
Revenue Recognition - Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in
the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums collected in
advance are recorded as deferred revenue. Employer contracts are typically on an
annual basis, subject to cancellation by the employer group or the Company upon
thirty days written notice. Management services revenues are recognized in the
period in which the related services are performed. Premiums for services to
federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the Office of
Personnel Management OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a
number of years in arrears. The Company provides reserves, on an estimated basis
annually, based on the appropriate guidelines. Any differences between actual
results and estimates are recorded in the year the audits are finalized.
Significant Customers - For the years ended 1999, 1998, and 1997, the
Company received 160%, 152%, and 140%, respectively, of its revenue from the
Federal Medicare program throughout the Company various markets.
Reinsurance - Premiums paid to reinsurers are reported as health
benefits expense and the related reinsurance recoveries are reported as
deductions from health benefits expense.
Income Taxes - The Company files a consolidated tax return for the
Company and its wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. The Company accounts for
income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109 SFAS 109. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by
multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting
bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. See Note I for disclosures related to income taxes.
Minority Interest - For 1997, the minority interest represents a joint
venture interest of 51% in Pennsylvania HealthMate, Inc. HealthMate.
Stock-based Compensation - The Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. As permitted by SFAS 123, the
Company has elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation to
employees under APB Opinion No. 25, and complies with the disclosure
requirements for SFAS 123. See Note L for disclosures related to stock-based
compensation.
Earnings per Share - In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 SFAS 128, Earnings per
Share. SFAS 128 establishes new standards for computing and presenting earnings
per share EPS, replacing primary EPS with basic EPS. Basic EPS excludes
dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. The
adoption of SFAS 128 did not have a material effect on the Company earnings
per share. All prior periods were previously restated to comply with SFAS 128.
See Note S for calculation of EPS.
Comprehensive Earnings - Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS 130 requires that changes in the amounts of certain
items, including unrealized gains and losses on certain securities, be shown in
the financial statements as part of comprehensive earnings. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial
statements.
Segment reporting - Effective December 31, 1998, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 SFAS 131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This standard requires
that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information
about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to
allocate resources                    42
45
and in assessing performance. SFAS 131 also requires that all public business
enterprises report information about the revenues derived from the enterprise
products or services or groups of similar products and services, about the
countries in which the enterprise earns revenues and holds assets and about
major customers regardless of whether that information is used in making
operating decisions. The Company has two reportable segments: Commercial
products and Government products. The products are provided to a cross section
of employer groups through the Company health plans in the Midwest,
Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern United States.
Commercial products include HMO, PPO, and POS products. HMO products
provide comprehensive health care benefits to enrollees through a primary care
physician. PPO and POS products permit members to participate in managed care
but allow them the flexibility to utilize out of network providers in exchange
for an increase in out-of-pocket costs to the member.
Governmental products include Medicare Risk, Medicare Cost, and
Medicaid. The Company provides comprehensive health benefits to members
participating in government programs and receives premium payments from federal
and state governments. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating
segments and allocates resources based on gross margin. Assets are not allocated
to specific products and, accordingly, cannot be reported by segment. See Note U
for disclosures on segment reporting.
Derivative Instruments - In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 133 requires companies to record
derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair
value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of the derivatives
would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they
qualify for hedge accounting. In June 1999, the FASB also issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 SFAS 137, which defers the effective
date of SFAS 133 until fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company
does not believe that adoption of SFAS 133 as amended by SFAS 137 will have a
material effect on its future results of operations.
Computer Software - Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted
Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA. SOP 98-1 provides
authoritative guidance for the capitalization of certain costs related to
computer software developed or obtained for internal applications, such as
external direct costs of materials and services, payroll costs for employees and
certain interest costs. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as
well as training and data conversion costs, are to be expensed as incurred. The
adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a material effect on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications - Certain 1997 and 1998 amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 1999 presentation.
B.    PHC ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
Effective April 1, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of
certain PHC health plans from Principal Life for a total purchase price of
approximately $3302 million including transaction costs of approximately $57
million. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the operating results of PHC have been included in
the Company consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
The purchase price consisted of 25,043,704 shares of the Company common stock
at an assigned value of $1196 per share. In addition, a warrant valued at $250
million the Warrant was issued that grants Principal Life the right to
acquire additional shares of the Company common stock in the event that its
ownership percentage of such common stock is diluted below 40%. The Warrant is
included as a component of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. Through April 2003, Principal Life is
restricted from buying additional shares of the Company common stock to
increase its ownership percentage above 40%.
Coincident with the closing of the transaction, the Company entered into
a Renewal Rights Agreement and a Coinsurance Agreement with Principal Life, to
manage certain of Principal Life indemnity health insurance policies in the
markets where the Company does business and, on December 31, 1999, to offer to
renew such policies in force at that time. Effective June 1, 1999, the Company
amended these agreements with Principal Life                    43
46
and waived its rights to reinsure and renew Principal Life health insurance
indemnity business located in the Company service area. The Company received
$198 million in cash in exchange for waiving these rights. At the date of the
amendment, the Renewal Rights and Coinsurance Agreements had a net book value of
$197 million resulting in an after tax gain of $01 million.
At the closing, the Company also entered into a Marketing Services
Agreement and a Management Services Agreement with Principal Life. Both
agreements expired on December 31, 1999. Pursuant to the agreements, the Company
recognized revenue of approximately $255 million and $230 million for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
As a result of the acquisition, the Company assumed an agreement with
Principal Life, whereby Principal Life paid a fee for access to the Company
PPO network based on a fixed rate per employee entitled to access the PPO
network and a percentage of savings realized by Principal Life. Effective June
1, 1999, Coventry sold the Illinois portion of the PPO network back to
Principal Life. Under this agreement, the Company recognized revenue of
approximately $80 million and $120 million for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively.
Effective November 30, 1998, the Company sold its subsidiary, Principal
Health Care of Illinois, Inc., for $43 million in cash. The Illinois health
plan accounted for approximately 56,000 risk members and approximately 2,400
non-risk members as of November 30, 1998.
On December 31, 1998, the Company sold its subsidiary, Principal Health
Care of Florida, Inc., for $950 million in cash. The Florida health plan
accounted for approximately 156,000 risk members and approximately 5,500
non-risk members as of December 31, 1998.
The proceeds from both sales were used to retire the Company credit
facility, to assist in improving the capital position of its regulated
subsidiaries, and for other general corporate purposes. Given the short time
period between the respective acquisition and sale dates and the lack of events
or other evidence which would indicate differing values, no gain or loss was
recognized on the sales of the Florida and Illinois health plans, as the sale
prices were considered by management to be equivalent to the fair values
allocable to these plans at the date of their acquisition from Principal Life in
April 1998.
In connection with the acquisition of certain PHC health plans and the
sales of the Florida and Illinois plans, the Company established reserves of
approximately $330 million for the estimated transition costs of the PHC health
plans. These reserves are primarily comprised of severance costs related to
involuntary terminations of former PHC employees, relocation costs of former PHC
personnel, lease termination costs and contract termination costs. Through
December 31, 1999, the Company has expended approximately $297 million related
to these reserves and expects to make payments on the remaining reserves through
July 2002.
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company notified the Indiana
Department of Insurance of its intention to close its subsidiary, Coventry
Health Care of Indiana, Inc. As of December 31, 1999, the health plan had
approximately 23,000 members throughout the state. As a result of the cost
associated with exiting the Indiana market, the Company recorded a reserve of
$20 million in the fourth quarter of 1999. The Company plans to close the
health plan by the end of the fourth quarter 2000 and has expended approximately
$04 million as of December 31, 1999.                    44
47     The purchase price for certain of the PHC plans was allocated to the
assets, including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on
estimated fair values. The $1740 million excess of purchase price over the net
identified tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill. The allocated amounts, net of the Florida and Illinois
health plans and net of the impact of waiving the Renewal Rights and Coinsurance
Agreements and the expiration of the Marketing Services Agreement, Management
Services Agreement and PPO access agreement, and their related useful lives are
as follows

Effective October 1, 1999, the Company acquired Carelink Health Plans
Carelink, the managed care subsidiary of Camcare, Inc., for a total purchase
price of approximately $83 million including transaction costs of approximately
$03 million. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and, accordingly, the operating results of Carelink have been
included in the Company consolidated financial statements since the date of
the acquisition. The purchase price for Carelink was allocated to the assets,
including the identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on estimated
fair values. The $47 million excess of purchase price over the net identified
tangible assets acquired was allocated to goodwill which is amortized over a
useful life of 25 years. The final purchase price may be adjusted subject to the
results of the final determination of the balance sheet of Carelink as of
October 1, 1999.
On November 1, 1999, the Company subsidiary, Coventry Health Care of
the Carolinas, Inc., acquired Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of North Carolina
KFHPNC commercial membership in Charlotte, North Carolina. The total
purchase price was approximately $18 million including transaction costs.
D.   MEDICAL OFFICE DISPOSITIONS
Effective March 31, 1997, the Company completed its sale of the medical
offices associated with HealthAmerica Pennsylvania, Inc., HealthAmerica, in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to a major health care provider organization. The
sales price was $200 million resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $60
million. Coincident with the sale, the Company entered into a long-term global
capitation agreement with the purchaser which increased the globally capitated
membership in western Pennsylvania to approximately 250,000 members. Under the
agreement, the provider organization receives a fixed percentage of premiums to
cover all of the medical treatment                    45
48
the globally capitated members receive. The provider organization filed for
bankruptcy protection on July 21, 1998 and , as a result, the Company is no
longer operating under this agreement. See Note E for AHERF Charge.
Effective May 1, 1997, the Company completed its sale of the medical
offices associated with GHP, its health plan in St. Louis, Missouri, to a major
health care provider organization. The sales price was $269 million resulting
in a pretax gain of approximately $96 million. Coincident with the sale, the
Company entered into a long-term global capitation agreement with the purchaser
covering approximately 83,000 members, pursuant to which the provider
organization receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover all of the medical
treatment the globally capitated members receive.
In August 1997, the Company entered into agreements to sell certain
remaining medical offices associated with HealthAmerica in Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. The sales price was $24 million and the transaction resulted in a
pretax loss of $06 million. All gains or losses resulting from medical office
sales are reflected in other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 1997.
E.    AHERF CHARGE
The Company and certain affiliated hospitals of Allegheny Health,
Education and Research Foundation AHERF were involved in litigation to
determine if the Company had the financial responsibility for medical services
provided to the Company members by the hospitals as a consequence of the
bankruptcy filed by AHERF on July 21, 1998. As a result of the bankruptcy, AHERF
failed to pay for medical services under its global capitation agreement with
the Company covering approximately 250,000 Company members in the western
Pennsylvania market.
Shortly after AHERF filed for bankruptcy protection, the Company filed a
lawsuit against AHERF non-debtor, affiliated hospitals seeking a declaratory
judgment that the Company was not obligated to pay in excess of $215 million to
the hospitals for medical services provided by them to the Company members.
The lawsuit also included additional claims for monetary damages. In response,
the hospitals filed a counterclaim alleging that the Company subsidiary,
HealthAmerica Pennsylvania, Inc., was liable to the hospitals for payment of
these medical services.
As a result, the Company, which is ultimately responsible for medical
costs delivered to its members, notwithstanding the global capitation agreement,
recorded a charge of $550 million in the second quarter of 1998 to establish a
reserve for, among other things, the medical costs incurred by its members under
the AHERF global capitation agreement at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
On July 22, 1999, the Company reached a settlement with the hospitals,
including Allegheny General Hospital, formerly owned by AHERF, and its new
owner, Western Pennsylvania Health Care System West Penn, whereby the
hospitals agreed that the Company would not be liable for the payment of certain
medical services rendered by the hospitals to the Company members prior to
July 21, 1998, the date of AHERF bankruptcy filing. Simultaneous with the
settlement, the Company signed a new three-year provider contract with West
Penn. The conditions to execute the settlement and the provider contract were
finalized in October 1999 and, as a result, all liability issues surrounding
AHERF failure to fulfil its contractual obligations and the Company
remaining obligations have been determined and all AHERF-related litigation has
been concluded.
As of December 31, 1999, approximately $354 million of the $550
million reserve had been paid for medical claims. As a result of the settlement,
the Company released $63 million of the reserve, which was reflected as a gain
in the fourth quarter and year-end 1999 results. The balance of the reserve
represents the Company remaining obligations under the settlement and will be
expended through August 2007.                    46
49 F.    MERGER COSTS
In connection with the acquisition of the PHC health plans, the Company
relocated its corporate headquarters from Nashville, Tennessee to Bethesda,
Maryland. As a result, the Company established a one-time reserve in 1998 of
approximately $65 million for the incurred and anticipated costs related to the
relocation of the corporate office and other direct merger related costs. The
reserve is primarily comprised of severance costs related to involuntary
terminations, relocation costs for management personnel, and lease costs, net of
sublease income, related to the unused space remaining at the old headquarters
location. As of December 31, 1999, the Company expended approximately $60
million and expects to make payments through March 2003 related to these
charges.
G.    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment is comprised of the following in thousands                                           DECEMBER 31,

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and
1997 was approximately $136 million, $122 million, and $89 million,
respectively.                    47
50 H.    INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES
The Company considers all of its investments as available-for-sale
securities and, accordingly, records unrealized gains and losses, as other
comprehensive earnings, in the stockholders' equity section of its consolidated
balance sheets. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, stockholders' equity was
decreased by approximately $59 million and increased by $03 million,
respectively, netted by a deferred tax benefit of approximately $23 million and
deferred tax cost of $01 million, respectively, to reflect the net unrealized
investment loss/ gain on securities.
The amortized cost, gross unrealized gain or loss and estimated fair
value of short-term and long-term investments by security type were as follows
at December 31, 1999 and 1998 in thousands           1999            AMORTIZED COST  UNREALIZED GAIN   UNREALIZED LOSS   FAIR VALUE

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1999 and 1998
is $33 million due to the Company belief that the realization of the deferred
tax asset resulting from federal and state net operating loss carryforwards
associated with certain acquisitions is doubtful.                    50
53 J.   CONVERTIBLE EXCHANGEABLE SUBORDINATED NOTES AND REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK
During the quarter ended June 30, 1997, the Company entered into a
securities purchase agreement Warburg Agreement with Warburg, Pincus
Ventures, L.P. Warburg and Franklin Capital Associates III, L.P.
Franklin for the purchase of $400 million of the Company 83% Convertible
Exchangeable Senior Subordinated Notes Coventry Notes, together with
warrants to purchase 235 million shares of the Company common stock for
$4235 million. The original amount of the Coventry Notes, $360 million held by
Warburg and $40 million held by Franklin, were exchangeable at the Company or
Warburg option for shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock.
During the second and third quarters of 1999, the Company converted all
Coventry Notes held by Warburg and Franklin totaling $471 million, including
interest, into 4,709,545 shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred
stock preferred stock at a price of $10 per share. The preferred stock is
subject to mandatory redemption at a price of $10 per share, plus accrued
dividends, in an amount equal to one-third of the shares outstanding on May 15,
2002, 2003 and 2004. The stock is carried at its fair value, which equals both
its redemption value and liquidation value as of December 31, 1999 and will
accrue dividends only if the Board of Directors declares dividends on common
stock. The dividends per share on the preferred stock would be equal to the
dividends on the common stock. The preferred stock may be converted at any time
at the holders' option into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal
to the closing market price of the Company common stock on the date of
conversion, if the closing market price is less than $10 per share. If the
closing market price of the Company common stock is greater than $10 per
share, the preferred stock is convertible to common stock on a share for share
basis. The preferred stock is callable by the Company if the market
price of the Company common stock exceeds certain agreed upon targets.
K.   LONG-TERM DEBT
At December 31, 1998, long-term debt of $781,000, payable to the U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services, represented obligations which were
assumed in the acquisition of HAPA. Under the terms of the notes, principal was
payable in various annual installments through June 30, 2000 with interest
payable semi-annually at rates ranging from 775% to 9125%. The notes were
secured by certain assets of the Company. These notes were paid in full in May
1999.
Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $16 million,
substantially all of which related to the Coventry Notes.
The fair value of the Company long-term borrowings is based on quoted
market rates. The carrying amount of the Company borrowings approximates fair
value.
L.   STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had one stock incentive plan, the
Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan, with an
aggregate of 7 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance thereunder
to key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock options,
restricted stock and other stock-based awards. At April 1, 1998, the 1998 Plan
assumed the obligations of six stock option plans of Coventry Corporation with
total outstanding options representing 3,322,714 shares, and one stock option
plan of Principal Health Care, Inc. with total outstanding options representing
750,000 shares, as a result of the acquisition of the PHC plans. Under the 1998
Plan, the terms and conditions of grants are established on an individual basis
with the exercise price of the options being equal to not less than 100% of the
market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Options generally
become exercisable after one year in 20% to 25% increments per year and expire
ten years from the date of grant. The 1998 Plan is authorized to grant either
incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options at the discretion of the
Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors.                    51
54    As of September 10, 1998, employees of the Company were offered an
opportunity to exchange their existing options issued at a higher exercise
price for a reduced number of new options issued at a lower exercise price
equivalent to the same value as their existing options, based upon a
Black-Scholes equal valuation model. Employees could choose to decline the offer
of new options and keep their existing options. As a result, the Company
canceled approximately 4,370,100 options, and reissued re-priced options equal
to approximately 3,714,182 shares. The options canceled were at exercise prices
ranging from a high of $22750 to a low of $63750. The options were reissued in
accordance with an exchange formula using the Black-Scholes equal valuation
model that issued one-half of the new options at an exercise price of the then
current market value $500 and the remaining one-half at 150% of the then
current market value $750. The resulting value of the repriced options was
the same as the exchanged options.
During 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997
Plan. Under the 1997 Plan, the Company may grant options and other rights with
respect to the Company common stock to officers, other key employees,
consultants and outside directors of the Company. A total of 1,600,000 shares of
common stock was reserved for this issuance.
The Company follows APB No. 25, under which no compensation cost has been
recognized in connection with stock option grants. Had compensation cost for
these plans been determined consistent with SFAS 123, the Company net income
and earnings per share would have been reduced to the following pro forma
amounts in thousands, except per share data                                       FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may
not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

At December 31, 1999, the Company had outstanding warrants granting
holders the right to purchase 5,690,188 shares of common stock. In July 1995,
100,000 warrants were issued at a price of $14125 and expire in July 2000.
During the first half of 1996, warrants for 170,000 shares were exercised at a
price of $675 per share.
On July 7, 1997, the Company finalized the sale of $40 million of
Coventry Convertible Exchangeable Subordinated Notes, together with warrants to
purchase 2,352,941 shares at $10625 per share of common stock. The purchase
price for the warrants was $100 per share, valued by the Company and the
purchaser. The warrants expire seven years from the purchase date.
On April 1, 1998, the Company issued a warrant to PHC the Principal
Warrant to purchase that number of shares of common stock equal to 66-2/3% of
the total number of shares of common stock actually issued upon the exercise or
conversion of the Company employee stock options and warrants issued and
outstanding at March 31, 1998, on the same terms and conditions as set forth in
the respective options and warrants. The subsequent repricing of outstanding
employee stock options on September 10, 1998 see above did not affect the
Principal Warrant. Options and warrants that terminated or expired and are not
exercised, are also canceled in the Principal Warrant. At March 31, 1998, the
Company had options and warrants outstanding for 5,800,480 shares of common
stock, representing the right to purchase 3,866,986 shares under the Principal
Warrant. On May 21, 1999 and November 11, 1999, PHC exercised a portion of the
Principal Warrant pursuant to exercises of the underlying options and purchased
1,335 and 10,915 shares of common stock, respectively. At December 31, 1999, the
Principal Warrant represented the right to purchase 3,017,183 shares, taking
into account exercises and cancellations.                    53

October 22, 1998, the Company issued warrants to certain providers to purchase a
total of 10,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7625 per share,
expiring in 2003. On December 21, 1998, the Company issued a warrant to an
individual in connection with the acquisition of a health plan to purchase
85,239 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $832 per share, expiring
in 2003. On December 21, 1998, the Company issued a warrant to an individual in
connection with legal services to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $7625 per share, expiring in 2009. On April 19, 1999, the
Company issued a warrant to an individual in recognition of years served on the
Company Board of Directors to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at an

The Company implemented an Employee Stock Purchase Plan in 1994, which
allows substantially all employees who meet length of service requirements to
set aside a portion of their salary for the purchase of the Company common
stock. At the end of each plan year, the Company will issue the stock to
participating employees at an issue price equal to 85% of the lower of the stock
price at the end of the plan year or the average stock price, as defined. The
Company has reserved 10 million shares of stock for this plan and has issued
11,416, 15,016, and 7,074, shares in 1999, 1998, and 1997 respectively.
M.   REINSURANCE
Throughout 1997, 1998 and the first quarter of 1999, the Company had
reinsurance agreements, through its subsidiary CHLIC, with American Continental
Insurance Company and Continental Assurance Company for portions of the risk it
has underwritten through its products. Beginning in April 1999, the Company
entered into new reinsurance agreements with Continental Assurance Company and
American Continental Insurance Company with greater coverages. Reinsurance
premiums for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were
approximately $99 million, $10 million and $07 million respectively.
Reinsurance recoveries, including amounts receivable, for the same periods were
approximately $59 million, $06 million and $04 million.
These reinsurance agreements do not release the Company from its primary
obligations to its membership. The Company remains liable to its membership if
the reinsurers are unable to meet their contractual obligations under the
reinsurance agreements. All reinsurance agreements are subject to certain limits
on hospital costs per patient-day. To minimize its exposure to significant
losses from reinsurer insolvencies, the Company evaluates the financial
condition of its reinsurers on an annual basis. American Continental Insurance
Company and Continental Assurance Company are both currently A rated by the A.M.
Best Company.
Medicaid risk exposures in Missouri are reinsured through the State of
Missouri mandated program. Reinsurance recoveries for the years ended December
31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were approximately $31 million, $21 million and $36
million, respectively.                    54
57 N.   COMMITMENTS
The Company operates primarily in leased facilities with original lease
terms of up to ten years with options for renewal. The Company also leases
computer equipment with lease terms of approximately three years. Leases that
expire generally are expected to be renewed or replaced by other leases.
The minimum rental commitments payable and minimum sublease rentals to be

O.   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
investments in marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company
invests its excess cash in interest bearing deposits with major banks,
commercial paper, and money market funds. Investments in marketable securities
are managed within guidelines established by the Board of Directors which
emphasize investment-grade fixed income securities and limit the amount that may
be invested in any one issuer. The fair value of the Company financial
instruments is substantially equivalent to their carrying value and, although
there is some credit risk associated with these instruments, the Company
believes this risk to be minimal.
As discussed in Notes D and E to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company entered into long-term global capitation arrangements with two
integrated provider organizations. Global capitation agreements limit the
Company exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the
Company to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources
of the provider organization. To the extent that the respective provider
organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its
obligations under the global capitation agreements, the Company, which is
responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to its customer agreements,
will be required to perform such obligations, and may have to incur costs in
doing so in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the
global capitation agreements. To the extent that the Company becomes a party to
global capitation agreements with a single provider organization serving
substantial membership, the Company becomes exposed to credit risk with respect
to such organizations. The Company may utilize the following to manage such
risk: 1 contract with providers with significant net worth and cash reserves;
2 require letters of credit or cash to be reserved for claims payment and 3
monitor the providers' financial condition in regard to the Company membership.
Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Company customer
base and their breakdown among geographical locations. See Note A for additional
information with respect to accounting policies for accounts receivable.
The Company believes the allowance for doubtful collections adequately
provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 1999. The Company has a risk of
incurring loss if such allowances are not adequate.
As discussed in Note M to consolidated financial statements, the Company
has reinsurance agreements with major insurance companies. The Company monitors
the insurance companies' financial ratings to determine compliance with
standards set by state law. The Company has a credit risk associated with these
reinsurance agreements to the extent the reinsurers are unable to pay valid
reinsurance claims of the Company.                    55

P.   BENEFIT PLANS
On July 1, 1994, Coventry Corporation adopted an employee defined
contribution retirement plan qualifying under IRC Section 401k, the Coventry
Corporation Retirement Savings Plan the Plan, which covered substantially
all employees of Coventry Corporation and its subsidiaries who meet certain
requirements as to age and length of service and who elect to participate in the
Plan. Similar retirement savings plans offered by 1 both HAPA and GHP and 2
both Coventry Healthcare Management Corporation CHMC and HCUSA were merged
into the Plan effective July 1, 1994 and January 1, 1996, respectively.
Effective March 31, 1998, the Company was formed as the parent company of an
affiliated group of companies that includes Coventry Corporation. The Company,
with the approval of Coventry Corporation, adopted and became sponsor of the
Plan effective April 1, 1998. On April 1, 1998, the Coventry Health Care, Inc.
Retirement Savings Plan the New Plan was adopted and any prior PHC and
certain affiliated participant account balances included in the assets of the
former PHC qualified retirement plan were rolled over into the New Plan at the
election of the former PHC employees. Effective October 1, 1998, the Plan was
merged with the New Plan. All employees that were participants under the Plan
became participants in the New Plan. On October 1, 1998, the assets of the Plan
were merged and transferred to: 1 Principal Life Insurance Company, as funding
agent of the assets held under the terms of the Flexible Investment Annuity
Contract with Coventry Health Care, Inc., 2 Delaware Charter Guarantee and
Trust Company, as custodial trustee of the mutual funds and 3 Bankers Trust
Company, as custodial trustee of the New Plan participant loans and the
Coventry Health Care, Inc. Common Stock. Effective October 1, 1999, pursuant to
the merger of Coventry Health Plan of West Virginia, Inc. CHC-WV, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Carelink Health Plans, Inc.
Carelink whereby Carelink was the surviving entity, Carelink became an
adopting employer of the New Plan.
Prior to 1998, under the Plan, participants were able to defer up to 15%
of their compensation, limited by the maximum compensation deferral amount
permitted by applicable law. The Company made matching contributions equal to
100% of the participant contribution on the first 3% of the participant
compensation deferral and equal to 50% of the participant contribution on the
second 3% of the participant compensation deferral. Prior to 1998,
participants vested in the Company matching contributions in 20% increments
annually over a period of 5 years, based on length of service with the Company
and/or its subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 1998, under the Plan and the New
Plan, participants may defer up to 15% of their compensation, limited by the
maximum compensation deferral amount permitted by applicable law. The Company
makes matching contributions in the Company common stock equal to 100% of the
participant contribution on the first 3% of the participant compensation
deferral and equal to 50% of the participant contribution on the second 3% of
the participant compensation deferral. Participants will vest in the Company
matching contributions in 50% increments annually over a period of 2 years,
based on length of service with the Company and/or its subsidiaries. All costs
of the Plan and the New Plan are funded by the Company and participants as they
are incurred.
On July 1, 1994, Coventry Corporation adopted a supplemental executive
retirement plan the SERP, which covered employees of Coventry Corporation
and its subsidiaries who 1 meet certain requirements as to age and management
responsibilities and/or salary, 2 are designated as being eligible to
participate in the SERP by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, and 3 elect to participate in the SERP and the
Plan. A similar supplemental executive retirement plan offered by HAPA was
merged into the SERP effective July 1, 1994. The Company, with the approval of
Coventry Corporation, adopted and became sponsor of the SERP effective April 1,
1998. Effective April 1, 1998, the SERP Plan name changed to the Coventry Health
Care, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Under the SERP, participants
may defer up to 15% of their base salary, and up to 100% of any bonus awarded,
over and beyond the compensation deferral limits of the Plan. Effective January
1, 1999, the Company amended the SERP definition of compensation to exclude
income or proceeds from the Company Stock Incentive Plan and relocation
payments. The Company makes matching contributions equal to 100% of the
participant contribution on the first 3% of the participant compensation
deferral and 50% of the participant contribution on the second 3% of the
participant compensation deferral. Prior to January 1, 1998, participants
vested in the Company matching contributions in 20% increments annually over a
period of 5 years, based on length of service with the Company and/or its
subsidiaries. Effective January 1, 1998, participants vest in the Company
matching contributions ratably over two years, based on length of service. All
costs of the SERP are funded by the Company as they are incurred.                    56
59
The cost, principally employer matching contributions, of the benefit
plans charged to operations for 1999, 1998 and 1997 was approximately $36
million, $40 million and $18 million, respectively.
Q.   STATUTORY INFORMATION
The Company HMO subsidiaries are required by the respective domicile
states to maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus in aggregate of
approximately $807 million at December 31, 1999. Combined statutory capital and
surplus of the Company HMOs was approximately $1598 million. The states in
which the Company HMOs operate require HMOs to maintain deposits with the
Department of Insurance. These deposits totaled $248 million at December 31,
1999.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has proposed that
states adopt risk-free capital standards that, if implemented, would generally
require higher minimum capitalization limits for health care coverage provided
by HMOs and other risk-bearing health care entities. To date, no state where
Coventry has HMO operations has adopted those standards.
CHLIC authorized control level risk-based capital is approximately
$118 million. Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus of CHLIC as of
December 31, 1999 was approximately $386 million. Statutory deposits for CHLIC
as of December 31, 1999 totaled approximately $35 million.
R.   OTHER INCOME
Other income for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997
includes investment income of approximately $303 million, $255 million, and
$108 million, respectively. As described in Note D, other income includes $150
million in 1997 from the sale of medical offices.                    57
60 S.   EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share EPS is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS, when applicable,
assumes the conversion of convertible notes and the exercise of all options,
warrants and redeemable convertible preferred stock using the treasury stock
method. Net earnings is increased for the assumed elimination of interest
expense on the convertible notes. In all cases, however, losses are not diluted.
The following table summarizes the earnings and the average number of
common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS in thousands,
except for per share amounts                                         1999

61 T.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a
defendant in various legal actions seeking payments for claims denied by the
Company, medical malpractice, and other monetary damages. The claims are in
various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial.
Incidents occurring through December 31, 1999 may result in the assertion of
additional claims. With respect to medical malpractice, the Company carries
professional malpractice and general liability insurance for each of its
operations on a claims made basis with varying deductibles for which the Company
maintains reserves. In the opinion of management, the outcome of these actions
should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results
of operations of the Company.
Other managed care companies have been sued recently in class action
lawsuits claiming violations of the federal racketeering act RICO and federal
employee benefits law ERISA, and generally claiming that managed care
companies overcharge consumers and misrepresent that they deliver quality health
care. Although it is possible that the Company may be the target of a similar
suit, the Company believes there is no valid basis for such a suit.
The Company industry is heavily regulated and the laws and rules
governing the industry and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject
to frequent change. Existing or future laws could have significant impact on the
Company operations.
UNITY ARBITRATION. GHP, a health plan subsidiary of the Company, entered
into an agreement, effective January 1, 1998, with Unity Health Network, L.L.C.
Unity for Unity provider network to provide health care services to GHP
members in the southern and western areas of St. Louis County, Missouri. The
agreement contained risk sharing provisions. Disputes arose under the agreement
and the matter was submitted to arbitration before the American Arbitration
Association AAA. GHP demanded payment from Unity of $76 million and
specific performance under the agreement. Unity demanded payment from GHP of
$145 million, specific performance of certain provisions of the agreement and
suspension of its payment obligations. On December 23, 1999, the AAA tribunal of
arbitrators awarded GHP the sum of $11 million for deficiencies in risk fund
pools for 1998, and awarded Unity the sum of $18 million as liquidated damages
for GHP failure to meet certain administrative performance standards, and held
Unity contractually liable for funding any deficits in the risk fund pools for
1999. The only remaining issue pending is the readjudication of certain disputed
claims submitted subsequent to June 30, 1999.
BJC. Effective May 1, 1997, the Company completed its sale of the medical
offices associated with Group Health Plan, Inc., its health plan in St. Louis,
Missouri, to BJC Health System BJC, a major provider organization in the St.
Louis market, for approximately $269 million. Upon the sale, the Company
entered into a long-term global capitation agreement with BJC, since amended,
that covered approximately 333% of the risk membership in St. Louis at December
31, 1998. Under the agreement, BJC receives a fixed percentage of premium to
cover all of the medical treatment received by the globally capitated members.
Various disputes alleging breaches have arisen under the BJC global capitation
agreement concerning the accuracy and timeliness of claims payments, and the
accuracy of membership reconciliations that would affect the amount of premiums
paid to BJC to provide its services under the agreement. BJC contends that these
alleged breaches entitles it to terminate the agreement. Although the parties
are obligated to arbitrate their disputes under the terms of the agreement, the
parties have agreed to attempt to negotiate a resolution of the various issues
while concurrently proceeding with arbitration. While the Company acknowledges
certain claims payment inaccuracies, the Company denies the remaining
allegations and vigorously disputes that any such claims constitute a material
breach of the agreement. Management does not believe that the outcome of these
disputes will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements,
although there can no assurance in this regard.                    59

Inc., by the end of the fourth quarter 2000. As a result of the cost
associated with exiting the Indiana market, the Company recorded a
reserve for $20 million in the fourth quarter of 1999.
2  In October 1999, the Company reached a settlement with AHERF. As a result
of the settlement, the Company released $63 million of its AHERF
reserve, which was reflected as a gain in the fourth quarter.
3  Effective April 1, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain
assets of PHC from Principal Life. The acquisition was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the operations
of PHC have been included in the Company consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition. As a result of the merger, an
estimated reserve of $78 million was established for the costs related
to the relocation of the corporate office from Nashville, Tennessee to
Bethesda, Maryland and other merger related expenses.
4  The second quarter 1998 operating results were affected by the
establishment of a reserve as a result of the bankruptcy filing by AHERF.
The establishment of the reserves resulted in a charge to earnings of
$550 million.
5  The merger costs were less than the reserve established in the second
quarter of 1998, resulting in a credit to earnings of $13 million.                    61
64 W.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Effective February 1, 2000, the Company completed its acquisition of The
Anthem Company West Virginia managed care subsidiary, PrimeONE, Inc.
PrimeONE, for the total purchase price of approximately $39 million
including acquisition costs. The $15 million excess of purchase price over the
net identifiable tangible assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. PrimeONE
has approximately 18,000 commercial members and annual premium revenue of $320

brings its total membership in the state to over 109,000 members.
On February 3, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Prudential
Health Care Plan, Inc. 11,800-member Medicaid business in St. Louis, Missouri
