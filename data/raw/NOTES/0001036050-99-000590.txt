ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
Management is responsible for the information and representations contained
in Conectiv consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles, based upon currently available facts and circumstances and manage-
ment best estimates and judgments of the expected effects of events and
transactions.
Conectiv and its subsidiary companies maintain a system of internal controls
designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance of the reliability
of the financial records and the protection of assets. The internal control
system is supported by written administrative policies, a program of internal
audits, and procedures to assure the selection and training of qualified per-
sonnel.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants, are engaged to audit
the financial statements and express their opinion thereon. Their audits are
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which in-
clude a review of selected internal controls to determine the nature, timing,
and extent of audit tests to be applied.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, composed of outside directors
only, meets with management, internal auditors, and independent accountants to
review accounting, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The independent
accountants are appointed by the Board on recommendation of the Audit Commit-
tee, subject to stockholder approval.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
Conectiv
Wilmington, Delaware
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in common stockholders' equity and
of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Conectiv and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of
Conectiv management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which re-
quire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and dis-
closures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall fi-
nancial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reason-
able basis for the opinion expressed above.

Other services, which are not subject to price regulation, are provided pri-
marily by Conectiv nonutility subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, by DPL
and ACE. Other services include: sales of petroleum products; heating, venti-
lation, and air-conditioning HVAC construction and services; construction
and operation of thermal energy systems; power plant operations; local and
long-distance phone service; and various other services.
Regulation of Utility Operations
Conectiv utility business is subject to regulation with respect to retail
electric sales by the Delaware and Maryland Public Service Commissions DPSC
and MPSC, respectively, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities NJBPU and
the Virginia State Corporation Commission VSCC, which have authority over
rate matters, accounting, and terms of service. Retail gas sales are subject
to regulation by the DPSC. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC
also has regulatory authority over certain aspects of Conectiv utility busi-
ness, including the transmission of electricity and gas, the sale of electric-
ity to municipalities and electric cooperatives, and interchange and other
purchases and sales of electricity involving other utilities. Excluding off-
system sales not subject to price regulation, the percentage of electric and
gas utility operating revenues regulated by each regulatory commission for the
year ended December 31, 1998, was as follows: NJBPU, 418%; DPSC, 389%; MPSC,
145%; VSCC, 14%; and FERC, 34%.
DPL and ACE are subject to the requirements of Statement of Financial Ac-
counting Standards SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation. Regulatory commissions occasionally provide for future recov-
ery from customers of current period expenses. When this happens, the expenses
are deferred as regulatory assets and subsequently recognized in the Consoli-
dated Statement of Income during the period the expenses are recovered from
customers. Similarly, regulatory liabilities may also be created due to the
economic impact of an action taken by regulatory commissions.

Refer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion
of regulatory assets arising from the financial effects of rate regulation and
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on the impact
and current status of electric utility industry restructuring.
Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Conectiv and
its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Ownership interests of 20% to 50% in other entities are accounted for by the
equity method of accounting. Investments in entities accounted for under the
equity method are included in Other investments on the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Earnings from equity method investees are included in Other income
in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Dividends on preferred stock of DPL for 1997 and 1996 have been reclassified
to Preferred Stock Dividend Requirements of Subsidiaries, resulting in a de-
duction before rather than after net income. This reclassification reflects
the current organizational structure in which DPL is a subsidiary of Conectiv.
Certain other prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally ac-
cepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the re-
porting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assump-
tions.
Revenue Recognition
At the end of each month, there is an amount of electric and gas service
rendered from the last meter reading to the month-end which has not yet been
billed to customers. The revenues associated with such unbilled services are
accrued by Conectiv.
When interim utility rates are placed in effect subject to refund, Conectiv
recognizes utility revenues based on expected final rates.
Revenues from Other services are recognized when services are performed or
products are delivered.
Deferred Energy Costs
Energy costs charged to Conectiv results of operations generally are ad-
justed to match energy costs billed to customers energy revenues under tar-
iffs for regulated energy sales. The difference between energy revenues and
actual energy costs incurred is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
Deferred energy costs. The deferred balance is subsequently recovered from
or returned to utility customers.
Nuclear Fuel
Conectiv share of nuclear fuel at the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station
Peach Bottom, the Salem Nuclear Generating Station Salem, and the Hope
Creek Nuclear Generating Station Hope Creek is financed through contracts
accounted for as capital leases. Nuclear fuel costs, including a provision for
the future disposal of spent nuclear fuel, are charged to fuel expense on a
unit-of-production basis.
II-24
Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities
In December 1998, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF, which evaluates ac-
counting issues under the direction of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB, concluded that, effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998, contracts entered into in con-
nection with energy trading activities should be marked to market, with gains
and losses unrealized and realized included in earnings EITF No. 98-10.
Conectiv uses futures, options and swap agreements to hedge firm commitments
or anticipated transactions of energy commodities and also creates net open
energy commodity positions. Conectiv used hedge accounting as subsequently
described, to account for certain energy trading activities during 1996 to
1998. As discussed above, beginning January 1, 1999, EITF No. 98-10 requires
mark to market accounting for energy trading contracts, including derivatives.
Conectiv currently uses derivatives mainly in conjunction with energy trading
activities.
Under hedge accounting, a derivative, at its inception and on an ongoing ba-
sis, is expected to substantially offset adverse price movements in the firm
commitment or anticipated transaction that it is hedging. Gains and losses re-
lated to qualifying hedges are deferred and are recognized in income when the
underlying transaction occurs. If, subsequent to being hedged, underlying
transactions are no longer likely to occur or the hedge is no longer effec-
tive, the related derivatives gains or losses are recognized currently in
earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge ac-
counting are recognized currently in revenues.
Premiums paid for options are included as current assets in the consolidated
balance sheet until they are exercised or expire. Margin requirements for
futures contracts are also recorded as current assets. Under hedge accounting,
unrealized gains and losses on all futures contracts are deferred on the con-
solidated balance sheet as either current assets or deferred credits. The cash
flows from derivatives are included in the cash flows from operations section
of the cash flow statement.
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, which becomes effective in the
first quarter of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, unless early
adoption is elected. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting stan-
dards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires that
all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet
and be measured at fair value. Under specified conditions, a derivative may be
designated as a hedge. The change in the fair value of derivatives which are
not designated as hedges is recognized in earnings. For derivatives designated
as hedges of changes in the fair value of an asset or liability, or as a hedge
of exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction, earnings are
affected to the extent the hedge does not match offsetting changes in the
hedged item.
Conectiv currently cannot determine the effect that SFAS No. 133 will have
on its financial statements. However, the adoption of EITF 98-10 prior to the
implementation of SFAS No. 133 is expected to reduce the impact of SFAS No.
133.
Depreciation Expense
The annual provision for depreciation on utility property is computed on the
straight-line basis using composite rates by classes of depreciable property.
Accumulated depreciation is charged with the cost of depreciable property re-
tired, including removal costs less salvage and other recoveries. The rela-
tionship of the annual provision for depreciation for financial accounting
purposes to average depreciable property was 38% for 1998, 37% for 1997, and
36% for 1996. Depreciation expense includes a provision for Conectiv share
of the estimated cost of decommissioning nuclear power plant reactors based on
amounts billed to customers for such costs. Refer to Note 9 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements for additional information on nuclear
decommissioning.
Nonutility property is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over
the useful lives of the assets.
II-25
Income Taxes
The consolidated financial statements include two categories of income tax-
es--current and deferred. Current income taxes represent the amounts of tax
expected to be reported on Conectiv federal and state income tax returns.
Deferred income taxes are discussed below.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects of tem-
porary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of existing
assets and liabilities and are measured using presently enacted tax rates. The
portion of Conectiv deferred tax liability applicable to utility operations
that has not been recovered from utility customers represents income taxes re-
coverable in the future and is shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
Deferred recoverable income taxes. Deferred recoverable income taxes were
$1844 million and $887 million as of December 31, 1998, and 1997, respec-
tively.
Deferred income tax expense represents the net change during the reporting
period in the net deferred tax liability and deferred recoverable income tax-
es.
Investment tax credits from utility plant purchased in prior years are re-
ported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Deferred investment tax cred-
its. These investment tax credits are being amortized to income over the use-
ful lives of the related utility plant. Investment tax credits associated with
leveraged leases are being amortized over the lives of the related leases dur-
ing the periods in which the net investment is positive.
Deferred Debt Refinancing Costs
Costs of refinancing debt of DPL and ACE are deferred and amortized over the
period during which the refinancing costs are recovered in utility rates.
License Fees
License fees represent the unamortized balance of amounts previously paid by
Atlantic Thermal Systems CTS' predecessor for the right to operate heating
and cooling systems of certain hotel casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey,
over a 20-year period. These fees are classified as License Fees on the bal-
ance sheet and are being amortized over 20 years.
Interest Expense
The amortization of debt discount, premium, and expense, including refinanc-
ing expenses, is included in interest expense.
Utility Plant and Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
Utility plant is generally stated at original cost, including property addi-
tions. Utility plant is generally subject to a first mortgage lien. Allowance
for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC is included in the cost of utility
plant and represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance
construction of new utility facilities. In the Consolidated Statements of In-
come, the borrowed funds component of AFUDC is reported as a reduction of in-
terest expense and the equity funds component of AFUDC is reported as other
income. AFUDC was capitalized on utility plant construction at the rates of
88% in 1998, 75% in 1997, and 67% in 1996.
Stock-based Employee Compensation
Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Conectiv ac-
counting policy on stock-based employee compensation.
II-26
Cash Equivalents
In the consolidated financial statements, Conectiv considers highly liquid
marketable securities and debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
Goodwill
Conectiv amortizes goodwill arising from business acquisitions over the
shorter of the estimated useful life or 40 years.
Leveraged Leases
Conectiv investment in leveraged leases includes the aggregate of rentals
receivable net of principal and interest on nonrecourse indebtedness and es-
timated residual values of the leased equipment less unearned and deferred in-
come including investment tax credits. Unearned and deferred income is rec-
ognized at a level rate of return during the periods in which the net invest-
ment is positive. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information on leveraged leases.
Funds Held By Trustee
Funds held by trustee are stated at fair market value and primarily include
deposits in Conectiv external nuclear decommissioning trusts and unexpended,
restricted, tax-exempt bond proceeds.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share has been computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earn-
ings Per Share. Under SFAS No. 128, basic earnings per share are computed
based on earnings applicable to common stock divided by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
are computed based on earnings applicable to common stock divided by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the pe-
riod after giving effect to securities considered to be dilutive common stock
equivalents. The effect of dilutive common stock equivalents was not signifi-
cant, and thus, for 1998, 1997, and 1996, Conectiv basic and diluted earn-
ings per share were the same amounts.

Effective January 1, 1998, New Jersey eliminated the Gross Receipts and Fran-
chise Tax paid by electric, natural gas and telecommunication public utilities.
In its place, utilities are now subject to the state corporate business tax.
In addition, the state existing sales and use tax was expanded to include re-
tail sales of electricity
II-28
and gas. A transitional energy facility assessment tax TEFA will be applied
for a limited time to electric and natural gas utilities and will be phased-
out over a five-year period. On January 1, 1999, and each of the four years
thereafter, the TEFA will be reduced by 20%. When fully implemented, this will
reduce ACE effective state tax rate from 13% to approximately 7%. Savings
from these changes in New Jersey tax law will be passed through to ACE cus-
tomers.
4. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
Merger with Atlantic
On March 1, 1998, DPL and ACE became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Conectiv.
Before the Merger, Atlantic owned ACE, an electric utility serving the south-
ern one-third of New Jersey, and nonutility subsidiaries. As a result of the
Merger, Atlantic ceased to exist, and Conectiv owns directly or indirectly
ACE, DPL, and the nonutility subsidiaries formerly held separately by Atlantic
and DPL. Conectiv is a registered holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 PUHCA.
In accordance with the terms of the Merger, DPL common stockholders received
one share of Conectiv common stock in exchange for each share of DPL common
stock, and Atlantic common stockholders received 075 of one share of Conectiv
common stock and 0125 of one share of Conectiv Class A common stock in ex-
change for each share of Atlantic common stock. Atlantic stockholders and DPL
stockholders received 39,363,672 and 61,832,699 shares of Conectiv common
stock, respectively. Atlantic stockholders received 6,560,612 shares of
Conectiv Class A common stock. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information concerning Conectiv Class A common stock and the
apportionment of earnings between Conectiv Class A common stock and Conectiv
common stock.
The Merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with
DPL as the acquirer. Based on the Merger date of March 1, 1998, the Consoli-
dated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 1998, includes ten
months of results of operations for ACE and the formerly Atlantic-owned non-
utility subsidiaries.
The total consideration paid to Atlantic common stockholders, measured by
the average daily closing market price of Atlantic common stock for the
three trading days immediately preceding and the three trading days immedi-
ately following the public announcement of the Merger, was $9207 million. In
connection with the Merger, $2890 million of goodwill was recorded, which is
being amortized over 40 years. As a result of the Merger, the following in-
creases occurred in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The pro forma information shown above has not been adjusted to exclude the
effects of employee separation and other Merger-related costs incurred by DPL.
For the year ended December 31, 1998, these costs reduced operating income,
net income, and earnings applicable to common stock by $277 million, $168
million, and $168 million, respectively. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Fi-
nancial Statements for additional information.
Acquisition of Other Service Companies
Conectiv expenditures to acquire HVAC and Other Service businesses in
1998, 1997, and 1996 were $153 million, $176 million and $93 million in-
cluding non-cash consideration, respectively.
5. EMPLOYEE SEPARATION AND OTHER MERGER-RELATED COSTS
To reduce the workforce by 785 employees in conjunction with the Merger,
Conectiv utilized enhanced retirement offers and other employee separation
programs. Prior to the Merger, DPL, Atlantic, and their subsidiaries had ap-
proximately 4,600 employees. The costs of the workforce reduction programs
were determined in accordance with SFAS No. 88, Employers' Accounting for
Settlement and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termina-
tion Benefits. The SFAS No. 88 costs for separated DPL employees and other
Merger-related costs expensed in 1998 were $277 million before taxes, reduc-
ing net income and earnings per common share by $168 million and $018, re-
spectively. The $277 million pre-tax charge was reduced by a net $455 mil-
lion gain from curtailments and settlements of pension and other
postretirement benefits.
Employee separation, relocation, and other Merger-related costs for
Atlantic former subsidiaries in 1998 were $808 million before taxes $483
million after taxes and were capitalized as costs of the Merger.
Of the $1085 million of costs discussed above for DPL and Atlantic former
subsidiaries, $575 million were paid as of December 31, 1998, $388 million
will not require the use of operating funds, and $122 million remains to be
paid from operating funds.
II-30
6. RATE MATTERS
Merger Rate Decrease
ACE and DPL are sharing a portion of the net cost savings expected to result
from the Merger with their customers through reduced electric and gas retail
customer base rates. ACE total Merger-related electric base rate decrease of
$157 million was phased-in as follows: 1 $50 million effective January 1,
1998 coincident with a $50 million increase for recovery of deferred other
postretirement benefit costs; 2 $99 million effective March 1, 1998, and
3 $08 million effective January 1, 1999. DPL total Merger-related base
rate decrease of $130 million is being phased-in as follows: 1 $115 mil-
lion effective March 1, 1998, 2 $11 million effective March 1, 1999, and
3 $04 million effective March 1, 2000.
Electric Utility Industry Restructuring
As discussed below, deregulation of the electric utility industry is under-
way in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Generally, with restruc-
turing, the supply component of the price charged to a customer for electric-
ity would be deregulated, and electricity suppliers would compete to supply
electricity to customers. Customers would continue to pay the local utility a
regulated price for the delivery of the electricity over the transmission and
distribution system.
Stranded costs are costs which may not be recoverable in a competitive en-
ergy supply market due to lower prices or customers choosing a different sup-
plier. Stranded costs generally include above-market costs associated with
generation facilities or long-term purchased power agreements, and regulatory
assets. DPL and ACE have quantified stranded costs in Maryland and New Jersey
regulatory filings, respectively, and have proposed plans seeking approval for
recovery of those costs from customers during the transition to a competitive
market.
When a specific plan that deregulates electricity supply becomes final, ACE
or DPL, as appropriate, would cease applying SFAS No. 71 to its electricity
supply business in the regulatory jurisdiction to which the plan applies. To
the extent that a deregulation plan provides for recovery of stranded costs
through cash flows from the regulated transmission and distribution business,
the stranded costs would continue to be recognized as assets under SFAS No.
71. Any stranded costs including regulatory assets for which cost recovery
is not provided would be expensed.
The amount of stranded costs ultimately recovered from utility customers, if
any, and the full impact of legislation deregulating the electric utility in-
dustry in any of the jurisdictions in which Conectiv operates cannot be pre-
dicted. Also, the quantification of stranded costs under existing generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP differs from methods used in regulatory
filings. Among other differences, GAAP precludes recognition of the gains on
plants or purchased power contracts not impaired, but requires write down of
the plants that are impaired. Due to these considerations, market conditions,
timing and other factors, Conectiv management currently cannot predict the
ultimate effects that electric utility industry deregulation may have on the
financial statements of Conectiv and its subsidiaries, although deregulation
may have a material adverse effect on Conectiv results of operations.
New Jersey
The Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act the Act was signed into
law by the Governor of New Jersey on February 9, 1999. The Act provides for
retail choice of electricity suppliers; deregulation of electric rates and
other competitive services, such as metering and billing; separation of com-
petitive and regulated services; unbundling of rates for electric service; and
licensing of electric and gas suppliers. August 1, 1999 is the effective
starting date for each utility to provide retail choice of electricity suppli-
ers to all of its customers.
The Act requires each electric utility to reduce its rates by at least 5% at
the start of retail choice and by 10% within 36 months of the start of choice.
If the NJBPU determines that a rate decrease of more than 10% is warranted, a
just and reasonable financial test is applied. The mandated rate reductions
must be sustained
II-31
through the end of the 48th month after choice begins. The Act requires that
the rate reductions be measured against the rates in effect on April 30, 1997.
The rate reductions mandated by the Act could have a material adverse effect
upon the results of operations of ACE and Conectiv.
In connection with the deregulation of electric rates, the Act authorizes
the NJBPU to permit electric public utilities to recover the full amount of
their stranded costs through a non-bypassable market transition charge, as
long as the mandated rate reductions are achieved. The NJBPU will determine
the utility stranded cost amount. The NJBPU determined stranded cost amount
will be subject to periodic recalculation and true-up over the recovery
period. The Act establishes an 8-year recovery period for stranded costs
associated with owned generation. The recovery period can be extended by the
NJBPU so as to allow for the full recovery of the stranded costs and the
meeting of mandated rate reductions. The recovery period for stranded costs
associated with purchased power contracts is to be the remainder of the
contract term. In addition, the Act would allow for the issuance of transition
bonds to finance portions of a given utility stranded costs, as determined
to be appropriate by the NJBPU. All savings generated through the use of such
transition bonds are to be provided to the customers through rate reductions.
The Act establishes the current incumbent utility as the provider of de-
fault service or Basic Generation Service BGS for a period of 3 years. Fu-
ture proceedings will be held to determine if the provision of BGS should be
made competitive. The Act contains numerous provisions regarding the providing
of competitive services by each utility. The primary focus is to ensure that
there is no cross subsidization from the utility to competitive entities. The
NJBPU also is required to develop fair competition standards and conduct an
audit to determine that the utilities are in compliance with those standards.
The Act gives the NJBPU the authority to order a utility to divest its gener-
ating assets if it is determined through a hearing that competition or custom-
ers are being adversely affected by plant location, market power or non-com-
petitive rates. The NJBPU may require that the generation function be sepa-
rated from a utility non-competitive functions.
The NJBPU is authorized to establish standards for the licensing of energy
suppliers, standards for switching customers from one supplier to another, and
standards for issues such as credit and collections. The Act also contains
provisions for protecting workers displaced by the impacts of the
restructuring of the utility industry.
Electric utilities in New Jersey, including ACE, previously filed stranded
cost estimates and unbundled rates, as required by the NJBPU. On August 19,
1998, an Administrative Law Judge ALJ from the New Jersey Office of Adminis-
trative Law issued an initial decision on ACE stranded costs and unbundled
rate filing. The ALJ, in reviewing ACE filing, recognized that ACE
stranded costs were $812 million for nonutility generation contracts and $397
million for owned generation. The ALJ made no specific recommendations on rate
issues. A final NJBPU decision on this filing is expected by mid-1999.
Delaware
The Alliance for Fair Electric Competition Today, which includes DPL, worked
with Delaware executive branch representatives and representatives of the DPSC
Staff to develop consensus restructuring legislation. House Bill No. 10, with
several amendments, passed the Delaware House of Representatives, and the Del-
aware Senate. The Governor of Delaware is expected to sign the legislation.
House Bill No. 10 would allow DPL Delaware customers to choose their elec-
tricity suppliers beginning on October 1, 1999 for customers with peak de-
mands of 1,000 kilowatts or more, January 15, 2000 for customers with peak
demands of 300 kilowatts or more, and 18 months after the legislation is en-
acted for all other customers. House Bill No. 10 also provides for a resi-
dential rate reduction of 75% beginning October 1, 1999. Thereafter, except
for a deferred fuel balance true-up and increases for extraordinary costs,
residential rates may not be changed for four years; rates for customers in
commercial and industrial rate classes may not be changed for three years. Un-
der House Bill No. 10, certain low-income energy assistance and environmental
programs are funded at an annual level of about $16 million by a charge in
electric rates.
II-32
Among other matters, unbundled rates to be charged by DPL during these rate
freeze periods have been agreed upon by a number of participants in the
restructuring plan proceeding contemplated by House Bill No. 10. Included
within the agreement on unbundled rates, DPL would recover $16 million
Delaware retail basis of stranded costs, and electric rates would not be
changed in the event DPL sells or transfers generating assets.
Maryland
In 1997, the MPSC issued two orders which provide for retail electric compe-
tition to begin July 3, 2000, and be phased-in over a three-year period one-
third of the customers per year. Enabling legislation and resolution of com-
plex issues such as stranded costs and utility taxation will be necessary for
implementation of retail competition in Maryland.
On July 1, 1998, DPL filed with the MPSC its quantification of stranded
costs and computation of unbundled rates, which are being considered in Case
No. 8795. Stranded costs were estimated to be $217 million on a DPL system-
wide basis $69 million Maryland retail portion, including $123 million at-
tributable to generating units, $54 million associated with purchased power
contracts, $21 million related to fuel inventory financing costs, and $19 mil-
lion of regulatory assets. DPL proposed full recovery of the Maryland portion
of the stranded costs over a three-year period, starting with the commencement
of retail competition on July 3, 2000.
The MPSC Staff and other parties contend that the market value of DPL gener-
ating assets exceeds their book value and thus that DPL has negative stranded
costs, or so-called stranded benefits. Proposals for rate reductions based
on a sharing of these alleged benefits and other factors have been submitted
to the MPSC in Case No. 8795. The proposed rate reductions vary widely, from
3% up to levels which, if adopted, would have a material adverse impact on
Conectiv results of operations.
Maryland electric utilities, including DPL, continue to meet with the MPSC
Staff and others to develop consensus enabling restructuring and related tax
legislation for possible passage in the 1999 legislative session.
The MPSC is expected to issue its order on DPL stranded cost recovery and
unbundled rates by October 1, 1999.
Virginia
Comprehensive electric utility restructuring legislation has been introduced
in the Virginia General Assembly. Senate Bill No. 1269 and identical House
Bill No. 2615, introduced on January 21, 1999, were drafted by a joint House-
Senate study committee created in 1996 to consider restructuring issues. Sig-
nificant provisions of these Bills provide for:. Phase-in of retail electric competition beginning January 1, 2002. Rates in effect on January 1, 2001 to become capped rates to continue
in effect through July 1, 2007, except for adjustments for changes in
fuel costs and state tax rates. Customers choosing an electricity supplier other than their incumbent
utility continue to pay capped transmission and distribution rates but,
instead of the capped generation rate, they would pay a wires charge
which would be the difference between the capped generation rate and
projected market prices for electricity. Just and reasonable net stranded costs are to be recovered through
capped rates and wires charges during the period January 1, 2001 through
July 1, 2007
Other Rate Matters
ACE is subject to a performance standard for its five jointly-owned nuclear
units. Under the standard, the composite target capacity factor for such units
is 70%, based upon the maximum dependable capacity of the
II-33
units. The zone of reasonable performance deadband is between 65% and 75%.
Penalties or rewards are based on graduated percentages of estimated costs of
replacement power. LEC rates are adjusted annually to include any penalty or
reward resulting from the nuclear unit performance standard. Pursuant to a De-
cember 1996 stipulation agreement, the performance of Salem Units 1 and 2,
during prolonged outages which began in the second quarter of 1995, is not in-
cluded in the calculation of a nuclear performance penalty. ACE was not sub-
ject to a nuclear performance penalty in 1996, 1997 or 1998.
7. SALE OF PINE GROVE LANDFILL AND WASTE HAULING COMPANIES
In the fourth quarter 1997, a subsidiary of Conectiv sold the Pine Grove
Landfill and a related waste-hauling company. The subsidiaries, which were
sold, had a net book value of approximately $113 million and reported reve-
nues in 1997 of approximately $127 million. Pre-tax proceeds received from
the sale were $342 million $334 million net of cash sold, resulting in a
pre-tax gain of $229 million $137 million after income taxes or $022 per
common share.
8. ENERGY HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITIES
Conectiv actively participates in the wholesale energy markets to support
its wholesale utility and competitive retail marketing activities. Conectiv
engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctu-
ations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities natural
gas, petroleum and electricity. Some hedging activities are conducted using
energy derivatives. The remainder of Conectiv hedging activity is conducted
by backing physical transactions with offsetting physical positions. The hedg-
ing objectives include the assurance of stable and known minimum cash flows
and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available.
Conectiv also engages in energy commodity trading and arbitrage activities,
which expose Conectiv to commodity market risk when, at times, Conectiv cre-
ates net open energy commodity positions or allows net open positions to con-
tinue. To the extent that Conectiv has net open positions, controls are in
place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management-approved risk
tolerance levels.
Conectiv utilizes futures, options and swap agreements to manage risk.
Futures help manage commodity price risk by fixing purchase or sales prices.
Options provide a floor or ceiling on future purchases or sales prices while
allowing Conectiv to benefit from favorable price movements. Swaps are struc-
tured to provide the same risk protection as futures and options. Basis swaps
are used to manage risk by fixing the basis differential that exists between a
delivery location index and the commodity futures price.
Exposed commodity positions may be long or short. A long position indi-
cates that Conectiv has an excess of the commodity available for sale. A short
position means Conectiv will have to obtain additional commodity to fulfill
its sales requirements. A delta position is the conversion of an option into
futures contract equivalents. The option delta is dependent upon the strike
price, volatility, current market price and time-value of the option.
Natural Gas Activities
At December 31, 1998, Conectiv had 1,314 2,697 long, 1,383 short net open
futures contracts, representing a notional quantity of 131 billion cubic feet
Bcf through February of 2001. In addition, Conectiv had a net long commodity
swap position equivalent to 459 futures contracts 46 Bcf and a net long ba-
sis swaps position equivalent to 531 futures contracts 53 Bcf.
Conectiv entered into 1,474 of the net long open futures contracts in order
to hedge the gas marketing activities of various Conectiv business units.
Other gas commodity hedges at December 31, 1998, included a net long commodity
swap position equivalent to 262 futures contracts and a net long basis swap
position equivalent to 471 futures contracts. During the year ended December
31, 1998, $40 million of losses were recognized on the settlement of natural
gas futures, swaps and options hedging contracts for the unregulated business
units. These losses were offset by gains on the physical commodity
transactions being hedged. A total of $86 million
II-34
of unrealized losses were deferred in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 1998. These losses are offset by gains on the physical commodity
transactions being hedged.
During the year ended December 31, 1998, a trading gain of $02 million was
realized on natural gas financial derivative activities that were not classi-
fied as hedges. Unrealized gains in forward gas trading positions physical
and financial totaled $08 million at December 31, 1998. The annual average
unrealized loss on trading activities, based on month-end averages, was
$01 million.
At December 31, 1997, there were 220 open futures contracts and 30 open
options contracts to purchase natural gas, representing a notional quantity of
25 Bcf through October 1999 and 60 open options contracts, to sell natural
gas, representing a notional quantity of 06 Bcf through July 1998. A total of
$05 million of unrealized losses were deferred in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 1997.
Electricity Activities
At December 31, 1998, Conectiv had a total short exposure of 102,400 mega-
watt-hours MWH 84,700 on peak, 17,700 off-peak through December 1999. The
overall position included a long option delta exposure of 2,300 MWH. The re-
maining exposure was comprised of forward contracts.
During the year ended December 31, 1998, a net gain of $01 million was rec-
ognized on the settlement of electric hedging options and swaps. This gain was
offset by losses on the physical commodity transactions being hedged. A total
of $03 million of unrealized losses were deferred in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 1998. During the year ended December 31, 1998, real-
ized gains of $102 million were recorded on power trading activities physi-
cal and financial not classified as hedges. At December 31, 1998, unrealized
gains on power trading activities amounted to $12 million. The annual average
unrealized gain on trading activities, based on month-end averages, was $13
million.
At December 31, 1997, there was one swap contract to sell electricity, rep-
resenting a notional quantity of 68,000 MWH, through August 1998. A total of
$02 million of unrealized losses were deferred on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 1997.
Petroleum Activities
Conectiv markets petroleum products through its subsidiary, Petron Oil Cor-
poration. Total petroleum exposure all grades at December 31, 1998 was
222,500 barrels short extending through December 31, 2000, with an
unrealized gain of $23 million. Conectiv was net long 315 petroleum futures
contracts 234 Heating Oil & 81 Unleaded Gasoline on December 31, 1998, ex-
tending through May 2000. $31 million of unrealized losses on petroleum fi-
nancial derivatives were offset by a combination of physical forward contracts
and inventory amounting to 5375 contracts short at an unrealized gain of
$54 million.
Credit Exposure
Counterparties to its various hedging and trading contracts expose Conectiv
to credit losses in the event of nonperformance. Management has evaluated such
risk and implemented credit checks and has established reserves for credit
losses. A large portion of the hedging and trading activities are conducted on
national exchanges backed by exchange clearinghouses. Management believes that
the overall business risk is minimized as a result of these procedures.

9. NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING
Conectiv subsidiaries, DPL and ACE, record liabilities for their share of
the estimated cost of decommissioning the Peach Bottom, Salem, and Hope Creek
nuclear reactors over the remaining lives of the plants based on amounts col-
lected in rates charged to electric customers. For utility rate-setting pur-
poses, ACE estimates its share of future nuclear decommissioning costs $185
million based on site specific studies filed with and approved by the NJBPU.
DPL estimates its share of future nuclear decommissioning costs $157 million
based on Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC regulations concerning the mini-
mum financial assurance amount for nuclear decommissioning.
Conectiv consolidated accrued nuclear decommissioning liability, which is
reflected in the accumulated reserve for depreciation, was $1677 million as
of December 31, 1998. The provision reflected in depreciation expense for nu-
clear decommissioning was $106 million in 1998, $42 million in 1997, and
$42 million in 1996. External trust funds established by DPL and ACE for the
purpose of funding nuclear decommissioning costs had an aggregate book balance
stated at fair market value of $1559 million as of December 31, 1998. Earn-
ings on the trust funds are recorded as an increase to the accrued nuclear
decommissioning liability, which, in effect, reduces the expense recorded for
nuclear decommissioning.
The ultimate cost of nuclear decommissioning for the Peach Bottom, Salem,
and Hope Creek reactors may exceed the current estimates, which are updated
periodically.
The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has questioned certain
of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry, includ-
ing Conectiv, regarding the recognition, measurement and classification of
decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations in the financial state-
ments of electric utilities. In February 1996, the FASB issued the Exposure
Draft, Accounting for Certain Liabilities Related to Closure or Removal of
Long-Lived Assets, which proposed changes in the accounting for closure and
removal costs of long-lived assets, including the recognition, measurement,
and classification of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating stations.
If the proposed changes were adopted: 1 annual provisions for
decommissioning would increase, 2 the estimated cost for decommissioning
would be recorded as a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation, and
3 trust fund income from the external decommissioning trusts would be re-
ported as investment income rather than as a reduction of decommissioning ex-
pense. The FASB plans to issue a revised Exposure Draft in the second quarter
of 1999.
II-36
10. REGULATORY ASSETS
In conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, Conectiv ac-
counting policies reflect the financial effects of rate regulation and deci-
sions by regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over Conectiv utility
business. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, Conectiv defers expense recogni-
tion of certain costs and records an asset, a result of the effects of rate
regulation. Except for deferred energy costs, which are classified as a cur-
rent asset or liability, these regulatory assets are included on Conectiv
Consolidated Balance Sheets under Deferred Charges and Other Assets. The
costs of these assets are either being recovered or are probable of being re-
covered through customer rates. Generally, the costs of these assets are rec-
ognized in operating expenses over the period the cost is recovered from cus-
tomers. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information
about the impact of electric utility restructuring on the accounting for regu-
latory assets. The table shown below details total regulatory assets liabili-
ties, at December 31, 1998, and 1997.

Deferred Recoverable Income Taxes: Represents the portion of Conectiv
deferred tax liability applicable to utility operations that has not been
recovered from utility customers and is recoverable in the future. As
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
reverse, deferred recoverable income taxes are amortized.
Unrecovered State Excise Taxes: Represents additional amounts paid, by ACE,
as a result of prior legislative changes in the computation of New Jersey
state excise taxes. These costs are included in current customer rates, with
the remaining balance scheduled for full recovery over the next 4 years.
Deferred Other Postretirement Benefit Costs: Represents the non-cash portion
of other postretirement benefit costs deferred by ACE during 1993 through
1997. This cost is being recovered over a 15-year period which began on Janu-
ary 1, 1998.
Unrecovered Purchased Power Capacity Costs: Represents prior deferrals by
ACE of capacity costs which had exceeded the related recovery from customers.
These costs are included in current customer rates and are scheduled for full
recovery over the next 2 years.
Unrecovered Purchased Power Contract Renegotiation Costs: Represents costs
incurred by ACE through renegotiation of a long-term capacity and energy con-
tract. These costs are included in current customer rates with the balance
scheduled for full recovery over the next 16 years.
Deferred Energy Costs: Represents the difference between energy revenues and
actual energy costs incurred. The deferred balance is generally recovered from
or returned to utility customers within one year.
II-37
Deferred Debt Refinancing Costs: The costs of refinancing debt of the util-
ity business are deferred and amortized over the period during which the costs
are recovered in rates, which is generally the life of the new debt.
Deferred Recoverable Plant Costs: Represents utility plant construction
costs excluded from plant in-service which are being recovered in customer
rates over the next 21 years.
Deferred Costs for Nuclear  Represents
amounts being amortized through fuel adjustment clause revenues for Conectiv
liability under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 for clean-up of gaseous diffu-
sion enrichment facilities of the U.S. government.
Asbestos Removal Costs: Represents costs incurred by ACE to remove asbestos
insulation from a wholly-owned generating station. These costs are included in
current customer rates with the balance scheduled for full recovery over the
next 31 years.
Deferred Demand-Side Management Costs: Represents deferred costs of programs
which allow DPL to reduce the peak demand for power. These costs are being re-
covered over 5 years.
11. CONECTIV COMMON STOCK
In conjunction with the Merger, DPL common stockholders received one share
of Conectiv common stock in exchange for each share of DPL common stock, and
Atlantic common stockholders received 075 of one share of Conectiv common
stock and 0125 of one share of Conectiv Class A common stock in exchange for
each share of Atlantic common stock. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information concerning the Merger.
For additional information concerning issuances and redemptions of common
stock during 1996 through 1998, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in
Common Stockholders' Equity.
Conectiv common dividends paid to public stockholders are funded from the
common dividends DPL and ACE pay to Conectiv. DPL and ACE certificates of
incorporation require payment of all preferred dividends in arrears if any
prior to payment of common dividends to Conectiv, and have certain other
limitations on the payment of common dividends to Conectiv.
Through the effective date of the Merger March 1, 1998, DPL Long-Term
Incentive Plan LTIP provided long-term incentives to key employees through
contingent awards of performance-based restricted stock, dividend rights, and
stock options. The DPL common stock options outstanding as of the Merger date
were converted to Conectiv common stock options and included in the Conectiv
Incentive Compensation Plan CICP. The restricted common stock previously
granted under DPL LTIP is earned and payable at the end of a four-year pe-
riod to the extent that stock performance compares favorably with the stock
performance of a peer group of utility companies. The 1994 awards were for-
feited in early 1998 when the required performance targets were not met. Re-
strictions on shares contingently granted in 1995 and 1996 lapsed upon the
Merger and the shares became fully vested. The restricted DPL common stock
contingently granted in 1997 was exchanged for Conectiv common stock upon the
Merger and is included in the CICP. As of December 31, 1998, there were 97,455
shares of the 1997 awards outstanding which had a $19 1/8 per share fair value
on the date of grant.
The CICP provides long-term awards to key employees and directors through
awards of stock-based compensation. Up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock may
be issued under the CICP during the ten-year period from March 1, 1998,
through February 28, 2008. Awards granted in 1998 under the CICP, which can be
settled in common stock, include performance accelerated restricted stock
PARS, stock options, and performance accelerated stock options PASO.
In 1998, Conectiv granted 30,700 shares of PARS, which are earned by partic-
ipants over a seven-year vesting period. Conectiv also granted participants
22,000 additional shares of PARS, which are earned over seven
II-38
years if a total stockholder return of 8% is achieved. Vesting of the 22,000
shares granted may be accelerated after three years, in whole or in part,
based on Conectiv stock price reaching certain levels. All 52,700 shares of
the PARS had a $2284 per share fair value on the grant date.
In 1998, Conectiv issued 289,000 stock options, which do not contain
performance acceleration features and have an exercise price of $2284 per
share. These stock options have a ten-year life. 50% of the options vest after
two years and the remaining 50% vest after three years. Conectiv also issued
750,000 PASO in 1998 which have an exercise price of $2284 per share. The
PASO have a ten-year life and vest after nine and a half years. One third of
the PASO will vest if Conectiv common stock price closes at or above $26
per share for ten consecutive days, two thirds will vest if the stock price
closes at or above $28 per share for ten consecutive days, and all of the
PASO will vest if the stock price closes at or above $30 per share for ten
consecutive days.
Changes in stock options are summarized below.

For options outstanding as of December 31, 1998, the range of exercise
prices was $1813 to $2284, and the weighted average remaining contractual
life was 88 years.
Conectiv recognizes compensation costs for its stock-based employee compen-
sation plans based on the accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Stock-based
employee compensation costs charged to expense were $09 million in 1998, $22
million in 1997, and $03 million in 1996. Pro forma net income, based on the
application of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, would
have changed by $06 million or less in 1998, 1997 and 1996. Earnings per
share would have changed by less than $001 per share in 1998, 1997 and 1996.
The fair value of each option and PASO granted in 1998 was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-aver-
age fair value of the options was $264 based on the following weighted-aver-
age assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 559 percent; dividend yield of
60 percent; expected volatility of 200 percent; and a weighted average ex-
pected life of 35 years. The weighted-average fair value of the PASOs was
$287 based on the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest
rate of 555 percent; dividend yield of 60 percent; expected volatility of
200 percent; and a weighted average expected life of 533 years.
On April 23, 1998, Conectiv Board of Directors adopted a Stockholders
Rights Plan the Plan. Under the Plan, holders of Conectiv common stock and
holders of Conectiv Class A common stock were granted preferred stock purchase
rights on May 11, 1998, by means of a dividend at the rate of one Right for
each share of common stock and one Right for each share of Class A common
stock held. The Rights expire in 10 years.
The purpose of the Plan is to guard against partial tender offers or abusive
or unfair tactics that might be used in an attempt to gain control of Conectiv
without paying all stockholders a fair price for their shares. The Plan will
not prevent takeovers, but is designed to deter coercive, abusive, or unfair
takeover tactics and to encourage individuals or entities attempting to ac-
quire Conectiv to first negotiate with the Board of Directors.
II-39
Each Right would, after the Rights become exercisable, entitle the holder to
purchase from Conectiv one one-hundredth of one share of Series One Junior
Preferred Stock or one one-hundredth of one share of Series Two Junior
Preferred Stock at an initial price of $65. The Rights will be exercisable
only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
aggregate voting power represented by Conectiv outstanding securities i.e.,
becomes an Acquiring Person as defined in the Plan or commences a tender or
exchange offer to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the aggregate
voting power represented by Conectiv outstanding securities. Conectiv
generally will be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time
before a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person.
12. CONECTIV CLASS A COMMON STOCK
Conectiv Class A common stock provides its holders a proportionately greater
opportunity to share in the growth prospects of, and a proportionately greater
exposure to the uncertainties associated with, the electric utility business
of ACE. Earnings applicable to Conectiv Class A common stock are equal to 30%
of the net of 1 earnings attributable to ACE regulated electric utility
business, as the business existed on August 9, 1996, less 2 $40 million per
year. Earnings applicable to Conectiv common stock are the consolidated earn-
ings of Conectiv less earnings applicable to Conectiv Class A common stock.
Presented below and on the following page are summarized ACE financial in-
formation and the calculation of earnings applicable to Conectiv Class A com-
mon stock. The ACE income statement amounts are for the ten months ended De-
cember 31, 1998, which is the period included in the 1998 Consolidated State-
ment of Income under the purchase method of accounting.

nancial Statements, these costs were capitalized as costs of the Merger,
as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Conversion and Redemption Provisions Relating to Class A Common Stock
Conversion at the Option of Conectiv
Conectiv may at any time convert each share of Conectiv Class A common stock
into the number of shares of Conectiv common stock equal to the specified per-
centage set forth in Conectiv Restated Certificate of Incorporation
Conectiv Charter of the Market Value Ratio of the Conectiv Class A common
stock to the Conectiv common stock as defined in the Conectiv Charter.
Redemption or Conversion Following a Tender or Exchange Offer
In the case of a tender offer by Conectiv for all of the Conectiv Class A
common stock for cash as defined in the Conectiv Charter or an offer to ex-
change each share of Conectiv Class A common stock into a number of shares of
Conectiv common stock equal to at least 110% of the Market Value Ratio of the
Class A common stock to Conectiv common stock as of the trading day immedi-
ately preceding the date of such offer which is accepted by the holders of
more than 50% of the Conectiv Class A common stock, Conectiv may either 1
redeem each share of Conectiv Class A common stock remaining outstanding in
exchange for cash in an amount equal to the highest cash price paid per share
by Conectiv pursuant to such tender offer or to the value of the highest num-
ber of shares of Conectiv common stock per share issued in exchange for any
share of Conectiv Class A common stock pursuant to such exchange offer as
such value is determined in accordance with the Conectiv Charter, as the case
may be, or 2 convert each share of Conectiv Class A common stock remaining
outstanding into shares of Conectiv common stock on the basis set forth in the
Conectiv Charter.
If any person including Conectiv makes a tender offer for all of the out-
standing shares of Conectiv common stock at an all cash price that is accepted
by the holders of more than 50% of Conectiv common stock, Conectiv may either
redeem each share of Conectiv Class A common stock for cash in an amount cal-
culated pursuant to a formula set forth in the Conectiv Charter, or convert
each share of Conectiv Class A common stock into shares of Conectiv common

DPL and ACE have established wholly-owned subsidiary trusts for the purposes
of issuing common and preferred trust securities and holding Junior Subordi-
nated Debentures the Debentures. The Debentures held by the trusts are their
only assets. The trusts use interest payments received on the Debentures they
hold to make cash distributions on the trust securities.
DPL and ACE obligations pursuant to the Debentures and guarantees of dis-
tributions with respect to the trusts' securities, to the extent the trusts
have funds available therefor, constitute full and unconditional guarantees of
the obligations of the trusts under the trust securities the trusts have is-
sued. DPL and ACE own all of the common securities of the trusts, which con-
stitute approximately 3% of the liquidation amount of all of the trust securi-
ties issued by the trusts.
For consolidated financial reporting purposes, the Debentures are eliminated
in consolidation against the trust investment in the Debentures. The pre-
ferred trust securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of
the Debentures at maturity or upon redemption. The Debentures mature in 2026
to 2036. The Debentures are subject to redemption, in whole or in part, at the
option of DPL and/or ACE, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued in-
terest, after an initial period during which they may not be redeemed and at
any time upon the occurrence of certain events.
In November 1998, Atlantic Capital II issued $25 million 1,000,000 shares
of 7 3/8% preferred stock.

ries preferred stock, and $313 million of various series of its $100 par
value preferred stock which had an average dividend rate of 568%. In December

2 Conectiv debt obligations included Variable Rate Demand Bonds VRDB in
the amounts of $1251 million and $715 million as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively. The VRDB are classified as current liabilities be-
cause the VRDB are due on demand by the bondholder. However, bonds submit-
ted to Conectiv for purchase are remarketed by a remarketing agent on a
best efforts basis. Conectiv expects that bonds submitted for purchase
will continue to be remarketed successfully due to Conectiv credit wor-
thiness and the bonds' interest rates being set at market. Conectiv also
may utilize one of the fixed rate/fixed term conversion options of the
bonds. Thus, Conectiv considers the VRDB to be a source of long-term fi-
nancing. The $1251 million balance of VRDB outstanding as of December 31,
1998, matures in 2009 $125 million, 2014 $182 million, 2017 $304
million, 2028 $155 million, 2029 $300 million and 2031 $185 mil-
lion. Average annual interest rates on the VRDB were 34% in 1998 and
38% in 1997.

Conectiv expected capital and acquisition expenditures are estimated to be
approximately $327 million in 1999.
As of December 31, 1998, ACE and DPL commitments under long-term purchased
power contracts were as follows: ACE-828 megawattsMW of capacity; DPL-237 MW
of capacity; and DPL-100 MW of energy. Currently, most of ACE capacity
charges are recovered under the Levelized Energy Clause and DPL capacity
charges are recovered through base rates. Historical information is presented
below for these contracts, including ACE from March 1, 1998, forward and a 48
MW capacity contract which was suspended in October 1996.

Capacity charges $ in  $1827 $285 $321
Energy charges $ in  $1665 $381 $325
Based on existing contracts as of December 31, 1998, Conectiv future
commitments for capacity and energy under long-term purchased power contracts
are estimated to be $3531 million in 1999; $3658 million in 2000; $3604
million in 2001; $3634 million in 2002; and $3675 million in 2003. Due to
uncertainties surrounding the restructuring of the electric utility industry,
Conectiv has not forecasted its long-term power purchase commitments beyond
2003.
Conectiv share of nuclear fuel at Peach Bottom, Salem, and Hope Creek is
financed through a nuclear fuel energy contract, which is accounted for as a
capital lease. Payments under the contract are based on the quantity of nu-
clear fuel burned by the plants. Conectiv obligation under the contract is
generally the net book value of the nuclear fuel financed, which was $633
million as of December 31, 1998.
II-47
Conectiv leases an 119% interest in the Merrill Creek Reservoir. The lease
is considered an operating lease and payments over the remaining lease term,
which ends in 2032, are $1505 million in aggregate. Conectiv also has long-
term leases for certain other facilities and equipment. Minimum commitments as
of December 31, 1998, under all such lease agreements excluding payments un-
der the nuclear fuel energy contracts, which cannot be reasonably estimated
are as follows: 1999 102 million; 2000 90 million; 2001 88 million;
2002 79 million; 2003 97 million; after 2003 1315 million; total 1771 million. Approximately 85% of the minimum lease commitments shown above
are payments due under the Merrill Creek Reservoir lease.

The health-care cost trend rate, or the expected rate of increase in health-
care costs, is assumed to gradually decrease to 50% by 2002. Increasing the
health-care cost trend rates of future years by one percentage point would in-
crease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $203 million and
would increase annual aggregate service and interest costs by $21 million.
Decreasing the health-care cost trend rates of future years by one percentage
point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$179 million and would decrease annual aggregate service and interest costs
by $18 million.

The following schedules reconcile the beginning and ending balances of the

The special termination benefits and curtailment and settlement gains and
losses shown above for 1998 resulted from Merger-related employee separation
programs discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective January 1, 1999, Conectiv adopted a cash balance pension plan
for covered employees. Conectiv will make contributions, which vary based on a
covered employee age and years of service, to individual employee accounts
provided for under the plan. The cash balance of each employee account in-
creases based on Conectiv contributions and interest income credited to the
accounts. The aggregate of the employee accounts will be Conectiv pension
obligation.
Conectiv also maintains 401k savings plans for covered employees. Conectiv
contributes to the plan, in the form of Conectiv stock, at varying levels up
to $050 for each dollar contributed by employees, for up to 6% of employee
base pay. The amount expensed for Conectiv matching contributions was $49
million in 1998, $30 million in 1997, and $24 million in 1996.
18. SALEM NUCLEAR GENERATING STATION
Conectiv, through DPL and ACE, owns 1482% of Salem, which consists of two
pressurized water nuclear reactors operated by Public Service Electric & Gas
Company PSE. Salem Units 1 and 2 were removed from operation by PSE in
the second quarter of 1995 due to operational problems, and maintenance and
safety concerns. After receiving NRC authorization, PSE returned Unit 2 to
service on August 30, 1997, and Unit 1 to service on April 17, 1998. The net
increase in fuel expenses due to unrecovered replacement power and other
costs, net of the benefit of lawsuit settlement proceeds received in 1997, was
$31 million in 1998, $31 million in 1997, and $101 million in 1996. The Sa-
lem outages also caused increases in operation and maintenance costs of ap-
proximately $4 million in 1997 and $9 million in 1996.
As previously reported, on February 27, 1996, the co-owners of Salem, in-
cluding DPL and ACE, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for
New Jersey against Westinghouse Electric Corporation Westinghouse, the de-
signer and manufacturer of the Salem steam generators. The complaint, which
sought to recover from Westinghouse the costs associated with and resulting
from the cracks discovered in Salem steam generators and with replacing such
steam generators, alleged violations of federal and New Jersey Racketeer In-
fluenced
II-50
and Corrupt Organizations Acts, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and breach
of contract. On November 4, 1998, the Court granted Westinghouse motion for
summary judgment with regard to the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act claim, and dismissed the remaining state law claims without
prejudice. On November 18, 1998, the co-owners re-filed their state law claims
against Westinghouse in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The co-owners also
filed an appeal of the District Court dismissal with the United States Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
19. CONTINGENCIES
Environmental Matters
Conectiv subsidiaries are subject to regulation with respect to the envi-
ronmental effects of their operations, including air and water quality con-
trol, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and limitations on land use by vari-
ous federal, regional, state, and local authorities. Federal and state stat-
utes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up
certain abandoned or uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. Costs may be incurred
to clean up facilities found to be contaminated due to past disposal practic-
es. Conectiv current liabilities include $30 million and $20 million as of
December 31, 1998, and 1997, respectively, for potential clean-up and other
costs related to sites at which a Conectiv subsidiary is a potentially respon-
sible party or alleged to be a third party contributor. Conectiv does not ex-
pect such future costs to have a material effect on its financial position or
results of operations.
Nuclear Insurance
In conjunction with DPL and ACE ownership interests in Peach Bottom, Sa-
lem, and Hope Creek , they could be assessed for a portion of any third-party
claims associated with an incident at any commercial nuclear power plant in
the United States. Under the provisions of the Price Anderson Act, if third-
party claims relating to such an incident exceed $200 million the amount of
primary insurance, they could be assessed up to $570 million on an aggregate
basis for such third-party claims. In addition, Congress could impose a reve-
nue-raising measure on the nuclear industry to pay such claims.
The co-owners of Peach Bottom, Salem, and Hope Creek maintain property in-
surance coverage of approximately $28 billion for each unit for loss or dam-
age to the units, including coverage for decontamination expense and premature
decommissioning. In addition, Conectiv is a member of an industry mutual in-
surance company, which provides replacement power cost coverage in the event
of a major accidental outage at a nuclear power plant. Under these coverages,
Conectiv is subject to potential retrospective loss experience assessments of
up to $94 million on an aggregate basis.
20. BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The following information is presented in accordance with SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. In ac-
cordance with SFAS No. 131, Conectiv business segments were determined from
Conectiv internal organization and management reporting, which are based
primarily on differences in products and services. Conectiv business seg-
ments under SFAS No. 131 are as follows: Generation--produces electricity and
operates power plants; Merchant--purchases and sells bulk energy; Power Deliv-
ery--delivers electricity and gas to customers at regulated prices over trans-
mission and distribution systems; Other--includes HVAC, plumbing, telephone
and other services provided to homes and businesses; thermal heating and cool-
ing systems for large commercial and industrial customers; and various other
businesses which are not subject to price regulation. All revenues of
Conectiv business segments are from customers located in the United States.
Also, all assets of Conectiv business segments are located in the United
States. Segment information for 1997 and 1996 has been restated to conform
with the current presentation.
Billings to electric and gas customers under regulated tariffs include
amounts for services provided by the Generation, Merchant, and Power Delivery
business segments. These revenues are allocated directly to the
II-51
Generation, Merchant, and Power Delivery business segments based on the cost
of services provided. The Merchant business segment revenues also include
revenues from bulk energy sales to off-system customers in markets not subject
to price regulation.
The services provided by one business segment to another business segment
are recorded as a transfer of costs, based on the fully-distributed cost of
the service provided. Common services which are shared by the business units
shared services are assigned directly or allocated based on various cost
causative factors, depending on the nature of the service provided. The depre-
ciation associated with shared services' assets is allocated to the business
segments; however, the assets and related capital expenditures are not allo-
cated.
The business segments' operating results are evaluated based on a profit
measure called contribution to corporate, which is equal to operating reve-
nues and other income less operating expenses, excluding corporate expenses.
Contribution to corporate for 1998 includes the January and February 1998 op-
erating results of the former Atlantic-owned companies and excludes Merger-re-
lated costs. Contribution to corporate in 1997 excludes the gain on the sale
of the Pine Grove landfill and its related waste-hauling company.
For internal management reporting purposes, Investments and Property, Plant
and Equipment are assigned to business segments, but Current Assets and De-
ferred Charges and Other Assets are not.

The quarterly data presented below reflect all adjustments necessary in the
opinion of Conectiv management for a fair presentation of the interim results.
Quarterly data normally vary seasonally because of temperature variations,
differences between summer and winter rates, the timing of rate orders, and
the scheduled downtime and maintenance of electric generating units.

ings per share for 1998 due to different amounts for average quarterly
common shares outstanding. Average Conectiv common shares outstanding by
quarter in 1998 were as follows: first quarter-- 74,684,396; second quar-
ter--101,063,174; third quarter--101,011,261; and fourth quarter   100,591,529.
2 Due to rounding, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share does not
equal the annual earnings per share.
Employee separation programs for DPL employees and other Merger-related
costs expensed in 1998 as discussed in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements had the effects shown below on 1998 quarterly operating results.
