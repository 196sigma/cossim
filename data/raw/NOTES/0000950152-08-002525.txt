MANAGEMENTS
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.   The following discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated
Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with
those statements and notes thereto.   This report contains various forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which represent our
expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including the
following   
the planned opening of approximately 40 American Eagle stores in
the United States and Canada, approximately 80 aerie stand-alone
stores and approximately 15 MARTIN + OSA stores in the
UnitedStates during Fiscal 2008   
the selection of approximately 40 to 50 American Eagle stores in
the United States for remodeling during Fiscal 2008   
the online launch of our new childrens apparel brand,
77kids by american eagle during Fiscal 2008 with the opening of
U.S.stores expected during 2010   
the completion of improvements and expansion at our distribution
centers   
the success of MARTIN + OSA and martinandosa.com   
17 Table of Contents   
the success of aerie by american eagle and aerie.com   
the expected payment of a dividend in future periods   
the possibility of growth through acquisitions
and/or
internally developing additional new brands;and   
the possibility that future auctions of our ARS holdings will
not be successful and that we may be required to take impairment
charges relating to our ARS investments.   We caution that these forward-looking statements, and those
described elsewhere in this report, involve material risks and
uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond
our control, as discussed within PartI, Item1A of
this
Form10-K.
Accordingly, our future performance and financial results may
differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such
forward looking statement.   Critical
Accounting Policies   Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that
may affect the reported financial condition and results of
operations should actual results differ. We base our estimates
and assumptions on the best available information and believe
them to be reasonable for the circumstances. We believe that of
our significant accounting policies, the following involve a
higher degree of judgment and complexity. See Note2 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of
our significant accounting policies. Management has reviewed
these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit
Committee of our Board.   Revenue Recognition.We record revenue for
store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers. Our
e-commerce
operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt
date of the merchandise. Revenue is not recorded on the purchase
of gift cards. A current liability is recorded upon purchase,
and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for
merchandise.   Revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns
and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions. The
estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise
returns determined through the use of historical average return
percentages. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood
that there will be a material change in the future estimates or
assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve.
However, if the actual rate of sales returns increases
significantly, our operating results could be adversely affected.   During Fiscal 2007, we discontinued assessing a service fee on
inactive gift cards. As a result, we estimate gift card breakage
and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card
redemptions as a component of net sales. We determine an
estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating
historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote
likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed.   During Fiscal 2006, we reviewed our accounting policies related
to revenue recognition and determined that shipping and handling
amounts billed to customers, which were historically recorded as
a reduction to cost of sales, should be recorded as revenue.
Accordingly, these amounts are recorded within net sales. Prior
year amounts were reclassified for comparative purposes.   During the three months ended October28, 2006, we began
recording sell-offs of
end-of-season,
overstock and irregular merchandise on a gross basis, with
proceeds and cost of sell-offs recorded in net sales and cost of
sales, respectively. Historically, we presented the proceeds and
cost of sell-offs on a net basis within cost of sales. Amounts
for prior periods were not adjusted to reflect this change as
the amounts were deemed to be immaterial.   Merchandise Inventory.Merchandise inventory
is valued at the lower of average cost or market, utilizing the
retail method. Average cost includes merchandise design and
sourcing costs and related expenses.   We review our inventory in order to identify slow-moving
merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise.
Additionally, we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned
markdowns related to current inventory. If inventory exceeds
customer demand for reasons of style, seasonal adaptation,
changes in customer preference, lack of consumer acceptance of
fashion items, competition, or if it is determined that the
inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed
price, additional markdowns may be necessary. These markdowns
may have a material adverse impact on earnings, depending on the
extent and amount of inventory affected.   
18 Table of Contents   We estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated
losses for the period between the last physical count and the
balance sheet date. The estimate for the shrinkage reserve is
calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected
by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage
trends. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that
there will be a material change in the future estimates or
assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve.
However, if actual physical inventory losses differ
significantly from our estimate, our operating results could be
adversely affected.   Asset Impairment.In accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFASNo144, we
evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an
asset might not be recoverable. Assets are evaluated for
impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted future cash
flows of the asset to the carrying value. If the future cash
flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of the
asset, we adjust the asset value to estimated fair value and an
impairment loss is recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses.   Our impairment loss calculations require management to make
assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows
and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the
assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk
inherent in future cash flows. We do not believe there is a
reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in
the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived
asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not
consistent with our estimates and assumptions, our operating
results could be adversely affected.   Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment of Investments.We record an
investment impairment charge at the point we believe an
investment has experienced a decline in value that is
other-than-temporary.
In determining whether an
other-than-temporary
impairment has occurred, we review information about the
underlying investment that is publicly available, analyst
reports, applicable industry data and other pertinent
information, and assess our ability to hold the securities for
the foreseeable future. The investment is written down to its
current market value at the time the impairment is deemed to
have occurred. Future adverse changes in market conditions,
continued poor operating results of underlying investments or
other factors could result in further losses that may not be
reflected in an investments current carrying value,
possibly requiring an additional impairment charge in the
future. Any
other-than-temporary
impairment charge could materially affect our results of
operations.   Share-Based Payments.We account for
share-based payments in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
SFASNo123R. To determine the
fair value of our stock option awards, we use the Black-Scholes
option pricing model, which requires management to apply
judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our
awards. These assumptions include estimating the length of time
employees will retain their vested stock options before
exercising them the expected term, the estimated
volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected
term and an estimate of the number of options that will
ultimately be forfeited.   We calculate a weighted-average expected term using the
simplified method as permitted by Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No107, Share-Based Payment
SABNo107. The simplified
method calculates the expected term as the average of the
vesting term and original contractual term of the options.
Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of
historical volatility of our common stock and implied
volatility. We chose to use a combination of historical and
implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more
representative of future stock price trends than historical
volatility alone. Estimated forfeitures are calculated based on
historical experience. Changes in these assumptions can
materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our
share-based payments and the related amount recognized in our
Consolidated Financial Statements.   Income Taxes.Effective February4, 2007,
we adopted FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of
FASB Statement No109 FIN48.
FIN48 prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing,
measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements
tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return,
including a decision whether to file or not to file in a
particular jurisdiction. Under FIN48, a tax benefit from
an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is
morelikely than not that the position is
sustainable based on its technical merits. See Note12 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
the adoption of FIN48.   
19 Table of Contents   We calculate income taxes in accordance with
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFASNo109, which requires the use
of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
difference between the Consolidated Financial Statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases as computed pursuant to FIN48. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates, based
on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published
guidance, in effect in the years when those temporary
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is
established against the deferred tax assets when it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes
may not be realized. Changes in our level and composition of
earnings, tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance, as
well as the results of tax audits may materially impact our
effective tax rate.   The calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, as
well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an
uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance
require management to make estimates and assumptions. Although
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there
will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used,
if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and
assumptions, the balances of the deferred tax assets,
liabilities and valuation allowance as well as net income could
be adversely affected.   Key
Performance Indicators   Our management evaluates the following items, which are
considered key performance indicators, in assessing our
performance   Comparable store sales Comparable store sales
provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one
year over the comparable prior year period. In fiscal years
following those with 53weeks, including Fiscal 2007, the
prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar
calendar weeks. A store is included in comparable store sales in
the thirteenth month of operation. However, stores that have a
gross square footage increase of 25% or greater due to a remodel
are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are
included in total sales. These stores are returned to the
comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following
the remodel.   Our management considers comparable store sales to be an
important indicator of our current performance. Comparable store
sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs,
including store payroll, store supplies, rent, etc. Comparable
store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales,
cash and working capital.   Gross profit Gross profit measures whether we
are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our
merchandise. Gross profit is the difference between net sales
and cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of: merchandise costs,
including design, sourcing, importing and inbound freight costs,
as well as markdowns, shrinkage, certain promotional costs and
buying, occupancy and warehousing costs. Buying, occupancy and
warehousing costs consist of: compensation, employee benefit
expenses and travel for our buyers; rent and utilities related
to our stores, corporate headquarters, distribution centers and
other office space; freight from our distribution centers to the
stores; compensation and supplies for our distribution centers,
including purchasing, receiving and inspection costs; and
shipping and handling costs related to our
e-commerce
operation. Any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial
markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns
could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of
operations.   Operating income Our management views
operating income as a key indicator of our success. The key
drivers of operating income are comparable store sales, gross
profit, our ability to control selling, general and
administrative expenses, and our level of capital expenditures.   Store productivity - Store productivity, including net
sales per average square foot, sales per productive hour,
average unit retail price, conversion rate, the number of
transactions per store, the number of units sold per store and
the number of units per transaction, is evaluated by our
management in assessing our operational performance.   Inventory turnover Our management evaluates
inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is
bought and sold. Inventory turnover is important as it can
signal slow moving inventory. This can be critical in
determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise.   
20 Table of Contents   Cash flow and liquidity Our management
evaluates cash flow from operations, investing and financing in
determining the sufficiency of our cash position. Cash flow from
operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of
cash. Our management believes that cash flow from operations
will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and
working capital requirements.   Results
of Operations   Overview   Fiscal 2007 marked another record year of financial performance
for American Eagle Outfitters. We managed the business with
discipline, achieving a 196% operating margin, while continuing
to invest in critical growth initiatives. Our results were
driven by our strong customer connection, well-positioned
brands, leading operations and technology, as well as the talent
within our teams.   Net sales for Fiscal 2007 increased 9% to $3055billion,
and consolidated comparable store sales increased 1% compared to
the corresponding 52week period last year. Our comparable
store sales increase was driven by a combination of higher units
per transaction and a higher average unit retail price resulting
in a higher transaction value.   Operating income as a percent to net sales was 196% for Fiscal
2007 compared to 210% for Fiscal 2006. The decrease was driven
by a decline in gross profit and increased depreciation and
amortization expense. This was partially offset by an
improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percent to net sales.   For Fiscal 2007, net income increased 3% to a record
$4000million. As a percent to net sales, net income
decreased to 131% during Fiscal 2007 from 139% during Fiscal
2006. Net income per diluted share increased 7% to $182 from
$170 per diluted share last year.   We ended Fiscal 2007 with $7857million in cash,
short-term and long-term investments. During the year, we
continued to make significant investments in our business,
including $2504million in capital expenditures. These
expenditures related primarily to our new and remodeled stores
in the U.S.and Canada, the expansion of our Ottawa, Kansas
distribution center, the construction of our new Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania corporate headquarters, information technology
upgrades at our home office and investments in our new aerie and
MARTIN + OSA stores. Additionally, during Fiscal 2007, we
repurchased 187million shares of our common stock as part
of our publicly announced repurchase programs for approximately
$4383million, at a weighted average price of $2338.   The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the
percentage relationship to net sales of the listed items
included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

aerie by American Eagle retail stores, 19 MARTIN + OSA retail
stores and AEO Direct.   
21 Table of Contents   Comparison
of Fiscal 2007 to Fiscal 2006   Net
Sales   Net sales increased 9% to $3055billion from
$2794billion. The sales increase resulted primarily from
an increase in gross square feet due to new and remodeled
stores, an increase in sales from our
e-commerce
operation, as well as a 1% increase in comparable store sales.   During the year, our AE Brand experienced a low single-digit
increase in average transaction value, driven by a low
single-digit increase in units per transaction and a slight
increase in average unit retail price. Comparable store sales
increased in the high single-digits in the mens business
and declined in the low single-digits in the womens
business over last year.   Gross
Profit   Gross profit increased 6% to $1423billion from
$1340billion in Fiscal 2006. Gross margin as a percent to
net sales decreased by 140basis points to 466% from 480%
last year. The percentage decrease was attributed to a
50basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate and
a 90basis point increase in buying, occupancy and
warehousing costs as a percent to net sales. Merchandise margin
decreased for the period due primarily to increased markdowns
and merchandise sell-offs partially offset by lower product
costs. See Note2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding merchandise sell-offs.
Buying, occupancy and warehousing expenses increased
90basis points as a percent to net sales primarily due to
higher rent, as well as delivery costs related to our AEO Direct
business. Share-based payment expense included in gross profit
increased to approximately $62million compared to
$58million last year.   Our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other
retailers, as some retailers include all costs related to their
distribution network, as well as design costs in cost of sales.
Other retailers may exclude a portion of these costs from cost
of sales, including them in a line item such as selling, general
and administrative expenses. See Note2 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a description of our accounting policy
regarding cost of sales, including certain buying, occupancy and
warehousing expenses.   Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7% to
$7152million from $6656million. However, as a
percent to net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses improved by 40basis points to 234% from 238%
last year. For the period, incentive compensation and supplies
expense improved as a percent to net sales partially offset by
increases in professional fees and advertising. Share-based
payment expense included in selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased to approximately $275million compared
to $308million last year.   Depreciation
and Amortization Expense   Depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% to
$1092million from $880million. As a percent to net
sales, depreciation and amortization expense increased to 36%
from 32%. These increases are primarily due to a greater
property and equipment base driven by our level of capital
expenditures.   Other
Income, Net   Other income, net decreased to $376million from
$423million. The decrease was primarily due to a
$35million realized capital gain last year and a decrease
in our gift card service fee revenue due to the gift card
program change that occurred in July 2007. These decreases were
partially offset by increased investment income resulting from
an overall increase in rates compared to last year.
Additionally, we recorded a $12million foreign currency
transaction loss as a result of a stronger Canadian Dollar
versus the U.S.Dollar compared to a $07million loss
last year.   Prior to July 2007, we recorded gift card service fee income in
other income, net. As of July8, 2007, we discontinued
assessing a service fee on inactive gift cards and now record
estimated gift card breakage revenue in net sales. In Fiscal
2007, we recorded gift card service fee income of
$08million compared to $23million for the   
22 Table of Contents   Fiscal 2006. For Fiscal 2007, we recorded breakage revenue of
$131million in net sales. This amount included cumulative
breakage revenue related to gift cards issued since we
introduced the gift card program.   Provision
for Income Taxes   The effective tax rate decreased to approximately 37% from 38%
last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily
related to a reduction in state income taxes and audit
settlements.   Net
Income   Net income increased 3% to a record $4000million, or
131% as a percent to net sales, from $3874million, or
139% as a percent to net sales last year. Net income per
diluted share increased to $182 from $170 last year. The
increase in net income was attributable to the factors noted
above. The increase in net income per diluted share was
attributable to the factors noted above, as well as a lower
weighted average share count this year compared to last year.   Comparison
of Fiscal 2006 to Fiscal 2005   Net
Sales   Net sales increased 20% to $2794billion from
$2322billion. The sales increase was due to a 12%
comparable store sales increase compared to the corresponding
53week period in Fiscal 2005, as well as an 8% increase in
gross square feet, due primarily to the addition of new stores.
The comparable store sales increase was driven by strong
customer acceptance of our assortments, as well as positive
store traffic. As a result, we experienced a high single-digit
increase in our average transaction value, driven by a mid
single-digit increase in units per transaction and a low
single-digit increase in our average unit retail price.
Comparable store sales percentages increased in the low
double-digits in both the mens and womens businesses
over Fiscal 2005.   Gross
Profit   Gross profit increased 24% to $1340billion from
$1078billion in Fiscal 2005. Gross profit as a percent to
net sales increased by 160basis points to 480% from 464%
last year. The percentage increase was attributed to a
100basis point improvement in the merchandise margin rate,
as well as a 60basis point reduction of buying, occupancy
and warehousing costs as a percent to net sales. Merchandise
margin improved for the period due primarily to lower markdowns,
as well as a higher markon, partially offset by increased design
costs and the impact of presenting the cost of merchandise
sell-offs and the related proceeds on a gross basis. See
Note2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding merchandise sell-offs. Buying,
occupancy and warehousing expenses decreased as a percent to net
sales due primarily to an improvement in rent expense as a
percent to net sales. Share-based payment expense included in
gross profit increased to approximately $58million
compared to $50million in Fiscal 2005 due to our adoption
of SFASNo123R at the beginning of Fiscal 2006.   Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23% to
$6656million from $5403million, rising
60basis points as a percent to net sales to 238% from
232% in Fiscal 2005. For the period, incentive compensation
including stock options, MARTIN + OSA expenses, and costs for
branded packaging increased as a percent to net sales. These
increases were partially offset by an improvement in store
salaries as a percent to net sales. Share-based payment expense
included in selling, general and administrative expenses
increased to approximately $308million compared to
$146million in Fiscal 2005, primarily due to our adoption
of SFASNo123R.   Depreciation
and Amortization Expense   Depreciation and amortization expense as a percent to net sales
decreased to 32% from 34% as a result of the positive
comparable store sales increase. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased 12% to $880million from
$787million due primarily to the increase in our property
and equipment base driven by our increased level of capital
expenditures.   
23 Table of Contents   Other
Income, Net   Other income, net increased to $423million from
$183million due primarily to increased investment income
resulting from higher cash and investment balances, as well as
improved investment returns. Beginning in the second quarter of
Fiscal 2006, we recorded gift card service fee income in other
income, net. Prior to this time, these amounts were recorded as
a reduction to selling, general, and administrative expenses.
For Fiscal 2006, we recorded gift card service fee income of
$23million. For Fiscal 2005, we reclassified gift card
service fee income of $24million from selling, general
and administrative expenses to other income, net.   Provision
for Income Taxes   The effective tax rate remained unchanged for Fiscal 2006 at
approximately 38% compared to Fiscal 2005.   Income
from Continuing Operations   Income from continuing operations increased 32% to a record
$3874million, or 139% as a percent to net sales, from
$2937million, or 127% as a percent to net sales in
Fiscal 2005. Income from continuing operations perdiluted
share increased to $170 from $126. The increase in income from
continuing operations was attributable to the factors noted
above.   Adoption
of New Accounting Standard   Effective February4, 2007, we adopted FIN48. As a
result of adopting FIN48, we recorded a net liability of
approximately $133million for unrecognized tax benefits,
which was accounted for as a reduction to the beginning balance
of retained earnings as of February4, 2007. See
Note12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of the FIN48 adoption.   In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the
FASB issued SFASNo123R.
SFASNo123R requires that companies recognize all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee
stock options, in the financial statements based on the fair
value of the equity or liability instruments issued. On
January29, 2006, we adopted SFASNo123R
using the modified prospective transition method. Prior to this
adoption, we accounted for share-based payments to employees
under the recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
No25, and related interpretations, as permitted by
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFASNo123. No
share-based employee compensation cost related to stock options
was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for
Fiscal 2005, as all options granted under those plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant.   As of February2, 2008, we had $197million and
$19million of unrecognized compensation expense related
to nonvested stock option awards and nonvested restricted stock
awards, respectively. This unrecognized compensation expense is
expected to be recognized over the weighted average periods of
18years for stock options awards and 8months for
restricted stock awards.   For additional information on our adoption of
SFASNo123R, see Note9 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements.   Income
Taxes   The effective tax rate used for the provision of income tax
approximated 37% and 38% in Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006,
respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is
primarily related to a reduction in state income taxes and audit
settlements.   Liquidity
and Capital Resources   Our uses of cash are generally for working capital, the
construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores,
information technology upgrades, distribution center
improvements and expansion, the purchase of both short and
long-term investments, the repurchase of common stock and the
payment of dividends. Historically, these   
24 Table of Contents   uses of cash have been funded with cash flow from operations.
Additionally, our uses of cash include: the purchase and
construction of our new corporate headquarters; the construction
of a new data center to support our information technology
needs; development of MARTIN + OSA; and development of aerie by
American Eagle. In the future, we expect that our uses of cash
will also include new brand concept development, including
development of 77kids by american eagle.   Our growth strategy includes internally developing new brands
and the possibility of acquisitions. We periodically consider
and evaluate these options to support future growth. In the
event we do pursue such options, we could require additional
equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that we
would be successful in closing any potential transaction, or
that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability.   The following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity   	
February2,
February3,
2008   2007   Working Capital in 000s     644,656     724,490   Current Ratio   271   256   Our current ratio increased to 271 as of February2, 2008
from 256 last year due primarily to a decrease in accrued
income and other taxes as well as a decrease in accounts
payable. Accrued income and other taxes decreased in comparison
to last year primarily due to the timing of income tax payments.
Accounts payable decreased due to a change in payment terms and
method with our foreign buying agent.   Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing
operations totaled $4643million during Fiscal 2007
compared to $7493million during Fiscal 2006 and $4804
during Fiscal 2005. Our major source of cash from operations was
merchandise sales. Our primary outflows of cash for operations
were for the purchase of inventory and operational costs.   The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities of
$2850million from the prior year was primarily due to
proceeds from the sale of trading securities of
$1840million received during Fiscal 2006, as well as a
$749million increase in cash used for the payment of
accrued income and other taxes, and a $479million
increase in cash used for the payment of accounts payable. The
increase in cash used for the payment of accrued income and
other taxes was due primarily to greater payments of accrued
income taxes this year as well as the timing of the payments.
The increase in cash used for the payment of accounts payable
resulted primarily from a change in payment terms and method
with our foreign buying agent, which also resulted in a
reduction to the available amounts that we maintain under our
unsecured letter of credit facility as discussed below.   Cash
Flows from Investing Activities   Investing activities for Fiscal 2007 included
$3542million from the net sale of investments classified
as
available-for-sale,
partially offset by $2504million for capital
expenditures. Investing activities for Fiscal 2006 primarily
included $4374million for the net purchase of investments
classified as
available-for-sale
as well as $2259million for capital expenditures.
Investing activities for Fiscal 2005 included $815million
for capital expenditures and $3114million for the net
purchase of investments.   We invest primarily in tax-exempt municipal bonds, taxable
agency bonds, corporate notes and auction rate securities, with
an original effective maturity of up to five years and an
expected rate of return of approximately a 46% taxable
equivalent yield. We place an emphasis on investing in
tax-exempt and tax-advantaged asset classes and all investments
must have a highly liquid secondary market at the time of
purchase and an effective maturity not exceeding five years.   Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   Cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from
$4383million used for the repurchase of our common stock
as part of our publicly announced repurchase programs and
$808million used for the payment of dividends during
Fiscal 2007. During Fiscal 2006, cash used for financing
activities resulted primarily from   
25 Table of Contents   $1465million used for the repurchase of our common stock
as part of our publicly announced repurchase programs and
$615million used for the payment of dividends. During
Fiscal 2005, cash used for financing activities from continuing
operations resulted primarily from $1610million used for
the repurchase of common stock as part of our publicly announced
repurchase programs and $421million used for the payment
of dividends, partially offset by $482million in proceeds
from stock option exercises during the period.   Prior to the adoption of SFASNo123R, we presented
all tax benefits from share-based payments as operating cash
flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
SFASNo123R requires that cash flows resulting
from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost be classified as financing cash flows.
Accordingly, for Fiscal 2007 and 2006, the excess tax benefit
from share-based payments of $62million and
$195million, respectively, are classified as financing
cash flows.   Auction
Rate Securities   As of February2, 2008, we had a balance of approximately
$418million of investments in ARS. Beginning
February12, 2008 through March25, 2008, we have
experienced failed auctions for 36 ARS issues representing
principal and accrued interest in the total amount of
$2725million. During this time, we have also sold nine
ARS issues, at par plus accrued interest, for a total of
$366million. As of March25, 2008 our ARS portfolio
totaled approximately $373million. We believe that the
current lack of liquidity relating to our ARS investments will
have no impact on our ability to fund our ongoing operations and
growth initiatives.   See Note13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on a subsequent event related to our auction rate
securities.   Credit
Facilities   During Fiscal 2007, we reduced the amount available under our
unsecured credit facility the facility to
$1000million and eliminated a $400million
unsecured demand line of credit the line under the
facility. The interest rate on the facility is either at the
lenders prime lending rate minus 100% or at LIBOR plus a
negotiated margin rate. At February2, 2008,
$66million was outstanding on the facility, leaving a
remaining available balance of $934million. No direct
borrowings were required against the line for the current or
prior periods. We also have an uncommitted letter of credit
facility for $1000million with a separate financial
institution. At February2, 2008, $280million was
outstanding on this facility, leaving a remaining available
balance of $720million.   Subsequent to Fiscal 2007, we reinstated the $400million
demand line and increased the amount available to
$750million as part of the facility. Additionally, we
borrowed $750million on this line and used the proceeds
to increase our cash position to add financial flexibility. The
interest rate on the borrowing is at the lenders prime
lending rate minus 100%.   See Note13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on a subsequent event related to credit facilities.   Capital
Expenditures   Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures of $2504million included
$1299million related to investments in our stores,
including 80 new and 53 remodeled stores in the United States
and Canada. Additionally, we continued to support our
infrastructure growth by investing in the expansion and
improvement of our distribution centers $476million,
construction of our new corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania $373million, information technology
upgrades at our home office $221million, and the
purchase of a corporate jet $135million.   We expect capital expenditures for Fiscal 2008 to be
approximately $250million to $275million, which will
relate primarily to approximately 40 new and 40 to 50 remodeled
American Eagle stores in the United States and Canada,
approximately 80 new aerie stand-alone stores, information
technology upgrades, the purchase and construction of the second
phase of our new corporate headquarters, investments in MARTIN +
OSA, including approximately 15 new stores, and distribution
center expansion/improvement, including the completion of the
second phase of our Ottawa, Kansas distribution center
expansion. We plan to fund these capital expenditures through
existing cash and cash generated from operations.   
26 Table of Contents   Stock
Repurchases   During Fiscal 2005, we repurchased 105million shares of
our common stock under various repurchase authorizations made by
our Board. During Fiscal 2006, we repurchased the remaining
53million shares of our common stock under the
November15, 2005 authorization for approximately
$1465million, at a weighted average share price of
$2789. As of February3, 2007, we had no shares remaining
authorized for repurchase.   During Fiscal 2007, our Board authorized a total of
600million shares of our common stock for repurchase
under our share repurchase program with expiration dates
extending into Fiscal 2010. During Fiscal 2007, we repurchased
187million shares as part of our publicly announced
repurchase programs for approximately $4383million, at a
weighted average price of $2338 per share. As of April2,
2008, we had 413million shares remaining authorized for
repurchase. These shares will be repurchased at our discretion.
Of the 413million shares that may yet be purchased under
the program, the authorization relating to 113million
shares expires in 2009 and the authorization relating to
300million expires in 2010.   During both Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, we repurchased
04million shares from certain employees at market prices
totaling $123million and $76million, respectively.
During Fiscal 2005, we repurchased 05million shares from
certain employees at market prices totaling $105million.
These shares were repurchased for the payment of taxes in
connection with the vesting of share-based payments as permitted
under the 2005 Stock Award and Incentive Plan and the 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan.   The aforementioned share repurchases have been recorded as
treasury stock.   Dividends   During the first quarter of Fiscal 2005, our Board authorized a
quarterly cash dividend of $0033 per share. Additionally, a
$005 per share dividend was paid during each of the second,
third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2005 and the first quarter
of Fiscal 2006. A $0075 per share dividend was paid during each
of the second, third and fourth quarters of Fiscal 2006 and the
first quarter of Fiscal 2007 and a $010 per share dividend was
paid during each of the second, third and fourth quarters of
Fiscal 2007.   Subsequent to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2007, our Board
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $010pershare,
payable on April11, 2008 to stockholders of record at the
close of business on March28, 2008. The payment of future
dividends is at the discretion of our Board and is based on
future earnings, cash flow, financial condition, capital
requirements, changes in U.S.taxation and other relevant
factors. It is anticipated that any future dividends paid will
be declared on a quarterly basis.   Cash
Flows from Discontinued Operations   Cash flows from discontinued operations, including operating,
investing and financing activities, are presented separately
from cash flows from continuing operations in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. The absence of the cash flows from
discontinued operations will not materially affect our future
liquidity or capital resources.   Obligations

Operating lease obligations consist primarily of future minimum
lease commitments related to store operating leases see
Note7 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating
lease obligations do not include common area maintenance,
insurance or tax payments for which we are also obligated.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of February2,
2008 is $542million, including approximately
$112million of accrued interest and penalties. Uncertain
tax benefits are positions taken or expected to be taken on an
income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax
authorities. We estimate that $94million of uncertain tax
benefits may be realized within one year. The balance of the
uncertain tax benefits are included in the More than
5Years column as we are not able to reasonably
estimate the timing of the potential future payments.

Purchase obligations primarily include binding commitments to
purchase merchandise inventory as well as other legally binding
commitments made in the normal course of business. Included in
the above purchase obligations are inventory commitments
guaranteed by outstanding letters of credit, as shown in the

Letters of credit represent commitments, guaranteed by a bank,

Sheet Arrangements   We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   Recent accounting pronouncements are disclosed in Note2 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Certain
Relationships and Related Party Transactions   See PartIII, Item13 of this
Form10-K
for information regarding related party transactions.   Impact of
Inflation/Deflation   We do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on
our net sales or our profitability. Substantial increases in
cost, however, could have a significant impact on our business
and the industry in the future. Additionally, while deflation
could positively impact our merchandise costs, it could have an
adverse effect on our average unit retail price, resulting in
lower sales and profitability.   
ITEM7A.
QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   We have market risk exposure related to interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is measured as the
potential negative impact on earnings, cash flows or fair values
resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or
foreign currency exchange rates over the next year.   
28 Table of Contents   Interest
Rate Risk   Our earnings are affected by changes in market interest rates as
a result of our short-term investments in tax-exempt municipal
bonds, taxable agency bonds, corporate notes, variable rate
demand notes VRDNs and auction rate securities,
which have long-term contractual maturities but feature variable
interest rates that reset at short-term intervals. We also
invest in long-term agency bonds. Due to the fact that our
investments are primarily fixed rate instruments, the effects of
interest rate changes are limited to VRDNs and auction rate
securities. If our current portfolio average yield rate
decreases by 10% in Fiscal 2008, our income before taxes will
decrease by approximately $29million. Comparatively, if
our current portfolio average yield rate decreased by 10% in
Fiscal 2007, our income before taxes would have decreased by
approximately $46million. These amounts are determined by
considering the impact of the hypothetical yield rates on our
cash, short-term and long-term investment balances. These
analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of
overall investments that could happen in such an environment.
Further, in the event of a change of such magnitude, management
would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to
the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific
actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the
sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our investments
structure.   Foreign
Exchange Rate Risk   We are exposed to the impact of foreign exchange rate risk
primarily through our Canadian operations where the functional
currency is the Canadian dollar. We do not hedge against foreign
currency exchange risks. We believe our foreign currency
translation risk is minimal as a hypothetical 10% change in the
Canadian foreign exchange rate would not materially affect our
results of operations or cash flows.

test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of American Eagle Outfitters,
Inc. at February2, 2008 and February3, 2007, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended February2,
2008, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles.   As discussed in Note9 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123R, Shared-Based
Payment, effective January29, 2006. As discussed in
Note12 to the consolidated financial statements, the

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles
of Consolidation   The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
At February2, 2008, the Company operated in one reportable
segment.   Fiscal
Year   The Companys financial year is a 52/53week year that
ends on the Saturday nearest to January31. As used herein,
Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and
Fiscal 2008 refer to the 52week periods ending
January29, 2011, January30, 2010, and
January31, 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2007
refers to the 52week period ended February2   
37 Table of Contents   AMERICAN
EAGLE OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   2008 and Fiscal 2006 refers to the 53 week period
ended February3, 2007. Fiscal 2005 and
Fiscal 2004 refer to the 52week periods ended
January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively.   Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires our management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis,
our management reviews its estimates based on currently
available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may
result in revised estimates.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements
SFASNo157. SFASNo157
addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are
required to use fair value as a measure for recognition or
disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting
principles. SFASNo157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. In February 2008, the
FASB issued Staff Position FSP
No.FAS157-2
Effective Date of FASB Statement No157 FSP
No.FAS157-2
which delays the effective date of SFASNo157 for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for
items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a
recurring basis at least annually. For items within its scope,
FSP
No.FAS157-2
defers the effective date to fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2008. The Company will adopt
SFASNo157 for its financial assets and financial
liabilities beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. The
Company does not expect the adoption of SFASNo157
to have a material impact on its future Consolidated Financial
Statements.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The Canadian dollar is the functional currency for the Canadian
business. In accordance with SFASNo52, Foreign
Currency Translation SFASNo52,
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were
translated into U.S.dollars the reporting currency at
the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. Revenues
and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S.dollars at the monthly average exchange rate for
the period. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are included in the results of operations, whereas,
related translation adjustments are reported as an element of
other comprehensive income in accordance with
SFASNo130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
see Note8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   SFASNo107, Disclosures about Fair Value of
Financial Instruments SFASNo107,
requires management to disclose the estimated fair value of
certain assets and liabilities defined by SFASNo107
as financial instruments. At February2, 2008, management
believes that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the
short maturity of these financial instruments. Short-term and
long-term investments consist of
available-for-sale
securities and are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets
at fair value, which is estimated based on quoted market prices
for the investments. Any difference between the original cost
and the fair value of these investments is recorded in other
comprehensive income. See Note13 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements for information on a subsequent event
related to the Companys auction rate securities.

EAGLE OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments and Long-term
Investments   Cash includes cash equivalents. The Company considers all highly
liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.   As of February2, 2008, short-term investments generally
included investments with remaining maturities of less than
12months averaging approximately one month, consisting
primarily of tax-exempt municipal bonds, taxable agency bonds
and corporate notes classified as
available-for-sale.
Additionally, short-term investments include variable rate
demand notes and auction rate securities classified as
available-for-sale,
which have long-term contractual maturities but feature variable
interest rates that reset at short-term intervals. See
Note13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information on a subsequent event related to the Companys
auction rate securities.   As of February2, 2008, long-term investments included
investments with remaining maturities of greater than
12months, but not exceeding five years averaging
approximately 34months and consisted primarily of agency
bonds classified as
available-for-sale.
Additionally, long-term investments included auction rate
securities classified as
available-for-sale,
which have long-term contractual maturities and feature variable
interest rates that reset at intervals greater than one year.   Unrealized gains and losses on the Companys
available-for-sale
securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
separate component of stockholders equity, within
accumulated other comprehensive income, until realized. When
available-for-sale
securities are sold, the cost of the securities is specifically
identified and is used to determine any realized gain or loss.   The Company evaluates its investments for impairment in
accordance with FSP No.
FAS115-1,
The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments
FSP No.
FAS115-1.
FSP No.
FAS115-1
provides guidance for determining when an investment is
considered impaired, whether impairment is
other-than-temporary,
and measurement of an impairment loss. An investment is
considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less
than its cost. If, after consideration of all available evidence
to evaluate the realizable value of an investment, impairment is
determined to be
other-than-temporary,
an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between
the investments cost and its fair value. The company did
not recognize any
other-than-temporary
impairment on investments during Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 or
Fiscal 2005.   See Note3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information regarding cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and long-term investments.   Merchandise
Inventory   Merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or
market, utilizing the retail method. Average cost includes
merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses. The
Company records merchandise receipts at the time merchandise is
delivered to the foreign shipping port by the manufacturer FOB
port. This is the point at which title and risk of loss
transfer to the Company.   The Company reviews its inventory levels in order to identify
slow-moving merchandise and generally uses markdowns to clear
merchandise. Additionally, the Company estimates a markdown
reserve for future planned markdowns related to current
inventory. Markdowns may occur when inventory exceeds customer
demand for reasons of style, seasonal adaptation, changes in
customer preference, lack of consumer acceptance of fashion
items, competition, or if it is determined that the inventory in
stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price. Such
markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings,
depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected. The
Company also estimates a shrinkage reserve for the period
between the last physical count and the balance sheet date. The
estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in
merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends.

sales. During the three months ended October28, 2006, the
Company began classifying its merchandise sell-offs on a gross
basis, with proceeds and cost of sell-offs recorded in net sales
and cost of sales, respectively. Amounts for prior periods were
not adjusted to reflect this change as the amounts were
determined to be immaterial. Below is a summary of merchandise
sell-offs presented on a gross basis for Fiscal 2007, Fiscal
2006 and Fiscal 2005.

and Equipment   Property and equipment is recorded on the basis of cost with
depreciation computed utilizing the straight-line method over
the assets estimated useful lives. The useful lives of our
major classes of assets are as follows   	
Buildings   25years   Leasehold Improvements   Lesser of 5 to 10years or the term of the lease   Fixtures and equipment   3 to 5years   In accordance with SFASNo144, management evaluates
the ongoing value of the Companys property and equipment,
including but not limited to leasehold improvements and store
fixtures associated with retail stores which have been open
longer than one year. Impairment losses are recorded on
long-lived assets used in operations when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. When
events such as these occur, the impaired assets are adjusted to
estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in
selling, general and administrative expenses. During Fiscal
2007, the Company recognized impairment losses of
$06million. The Company did not recognize any impairment
losses during Fiscal 2006 and recognized $12million in
impairment losses during Fiscal 2005.   Goodwill   As of February2, 2008, the Company had approximately
$115million of goodwill, which is primarily related to
the acquisition of its importing operations on January31,
2000, as well as the acquisition of its Canadian business on
November29, 2000. In accordance with
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, management evaluates goodwill for possible
impairment on at least an annual basis.   During Fiscal 2007, the Company modified its method of
translating the portion of goodwill related to the Canadian
operations into the reporting currency to be in accordance with
SFASNo52. The Company now translates this amount
using the spot foreign exchange rate as of the balance sheet
date. Amounts for prior periods were not adjusted to reflect
this change as the amounts were determined to be immaterial.   Other
Assets, Net   Other assets, net consist primarily of assets related to our
deferred compensation plans and trademark costs, net of
accumulated amortization. Trademark costs are amortized over
five to 15years.

STATEMENTSContinued   Deferred
Lease Credits   Deferred lease credits represent the unamortized portion of
construction allowances received from landlords related to the
Companys retail stores. Construction allowances are
generally comprised of cash amounts received by the Company from
its landlords as part of the negotiated lease terms. The Company
records a receivable and a deferred lease credit liability at
the lease commencement date date of initial possession of the
store. The deferred lease credit is amortized on a
straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term
of the lease including the pre-opening build-out period and
the receivable is reduced as amounts are received from the
landlord.   Self-Insurance
Reserve   The Company is self-insured for certain losses related to
employee medical benefits and workers compensation. Costs
for self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not
reported are accrued based on known claims and historical
experience. Management believes that it has adequately reserved
for its self-insurance liability, which is capped through the
use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies. However,
any significant variation of future claims from historical
trends could cause actual results to differ from the accrued
liability.   Customer
Loyalty Program   During Fiscal 2005, the Company introduced the AE All-Access
Pass the Pass, a customer loyalty program. Using
the Pass, customers accumulate points based on purchase activity
and earn rewards by reaching certain point thresholds during
three-month earning periods. Rewards earned during these periods
are valid through the stated expiration date, which is
approximately one month from the mailing date. These rewards can
be redeemed for a discount on a purchase of merchandise. Rewards
not redeemed during the one-month redemption period are
forfeited. A current liability is recorded for the estimated
cost of anticipated redemptions and the impact of adjustments to
the liability is recorded in cost of sales.   Stock
Repurchases   During Fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 105million
shares of its common stock under various repurchase
authorizations made by its Board. During Fiscal 2006, the
Company repurchased the remaining 53million shares of its
common stock under the November15, 2005 authorization for
approximately $1465million, at a weighted average share
price of $2789. As of February3, 2007, the Company had no
shares remaining authorized for repurchase.   During Fiscal 2007, the Companys Board authorized a total
of 600million shares of its common stock for repurchase
under its share repurchase program with expiration dates
extending into Fiscal 2010. During Fiscal 2007, the Company
repurchased 187million shares as part of its publicly
announced repurchase programs for approximately
$4383million, at a weighted average price of $2338 per
share. As of April2, 2008, the Company had
413million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.
These shares will be repurchased at the Companys
discretion. Of the 413million shares that may yet be
purchased under the program, the authorization relating to
113million shares expires in 2009 and the authorization
relating to 300million expires in 2010.   During both Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased
04million shares from certain employees at market prices
totaling $123million and $76million, respectively.
During Fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 05million
shares from certain employees at market prices totaling
$105million. These shares were repurchased for the
payment of taxes in connection with the vesting of share-based
payments as permitted under the 2005 Stock Award and Incentive
Plan and the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan.   The aforementioned share repurchases have been recorded as
treasury stock.

Split   On November13, 2006, the Companys Board approved a
three-for-two
stock split. This stock split was distributed on
December18, 2006, to stockholders of record on
November24, 2006. All share amounts and per share data
presented herein reflect this stock split.   Income
Taxes   Effective February4, 2007, the Company adopted
FIN48. FIN48 prescribes a comprehensive model for
recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the
financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken
on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to
file in a particular jurisdiction. Under FIN48, a tax
benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it
is more likely than not that the position is
sustainable based on its technical merits. See Note12 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
the adoption of FIN48.   The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with
SFASNo109, which requires the use of the asset and
liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the
Consolidated Financial Statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as
computed pursuant to FIN48. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using the tax rates, based on certain
judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance, in
effect in the years when those temporary differences are
expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established
against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be
realized. Changes in our level and composition of earnings, tax
laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance, as well as the
results of tax audits may materially impact our effective tax
rate.   The calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities, as
well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an
uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance
require management to make estimates and assumptions. Although
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there
will be a material change in the estimates and assumptions used,
if actual results are not consistent with the estimates and
assumptions, the balances of the deferred tax assets,
liabilities and valuation allowance could be adversely affected.   Revenue
Recognition   Revenue is recorded for store sales upon the purchase of
merchandise by customers. The Companys
e-commerce
operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt
date of the merchandise. Shipping and handling revenues are
included in net sales. Sales tax collected from customers is
excluded from revenue and is included as part of accrued income
and other taxes on the Companys Consolidated Balance
Sheets.   Revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns
and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions. The
Company records the impact of adjustments to its sales return
reserve quarterly within net sales and cost of sales. The sales
return reserve reflects an estimate of sales returns based on
projected merchandise returns determined through the use of
historical average return percentages. A summary of activity in
the sales return reserve account follows

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards. A current
liability is recorded upon purchase, and revenue is recognized
when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise. Additionally,
the Company recognizes revenue on unredeemed gift cards based on
an estimate of the amounts that will not be redeemed gift
card breakage, determined through historical redemption
trends. Gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion
to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net sales. For
further information on a change in the Companys gift card
program, see the Gift Cards caption below.   During the three months ended October28, 2006, the Company
began classifying sell-offs of
end-of-season,
overstock and irregular merchandise on a gross basis, with
proceeds and cost of sell-offs recorded in net sales and cost of
sales, respectively. Historically, the Company had presented the
proceeds and cost of sell-offs on a net basis within cost of
sales. For Fiscal 2007, the Company recorded $238million
of proceeds and $258million of cost of sell-offs within
net sales and cost of sales, respectively. For Fiscal 2006, the
Company recorded $53million of proceeds and
$65million of cost of sell-offs within net sales and cost
of sales, respectively. Amounts for prior periods were not
adjusted to reflect this change as the amounts were determined
to be immaterial.   During Fiscal 2006, the Company reviewed its accounting policies
related to revenue recognition. As a result of this review, the
Company determined that shipping and handling amounts billed to
customers, which were historically recorded as a reduction to
cost of sales, should be recorded as revenue. Accordingly,
beginning in Fiscal 2006, these amounts are recorded within net
sales. During Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded
$161million and $177million, respectively, in net
sales. The Company reclassified $126million for Fiscal
2005, from cost of sales to net sales.   Cost
of Sales, Including Certain Buying, Occupancy and Warehousing
Expenses   Cost of sales consists of merchandise costs, including design,
sourcing, importing and inbound freight costs, as well as
markdowns, shrinkage and certain promotional costs. Buying,
occupancy and warehousing costs consist of: compensation,
employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain
senior merchandising executives; rent and utilities related to
our stores, corporate headquarters, distribution centers and
other office space; freight from our distribution centers to the
stores; compensation and supplies for our distribution centers,
including purchasing, receiving and inspection costs; and
shipping and handling costs related to our
e-commerce
operation.   Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses   Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of
compensation and employee benefit expenses, including salaries,
incentives and related benefits associated with our stores and
corporate headquarters. Selling, general and administrative
expenses also include advertising costs, supplies for our stores
and home office, communication costs, travel and entertainment,
leasing costs and professional services. Selling, general and
administrative expenses do not include compensation, employee
benefit expenses and travel for our design, sourcing and
importing teams, our buyers and our distribution centers as
these amounts are recorded in cost of sales.   When the Company closes, remodels or relocates a store prior to
the end of its lease term, the remaining net book value of the
assets related to the store is recorded as a write-off of
assets. Prior to February3, 2007, the Company recorded
this write-off of assets within selling, general and
administrative expenses. However, the Company has determined
that classification within depreciation and amortization expense
is more appropriate. During Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, the
Company recorded $67million and $61million related
to asset write-offs within depreciation and amortization
expense. Prior year amounts of $41million for Fiscal 2005
have been reclassified for comparative purposes.   Advertising
Costs   Certain advertising costs, including direct mail, in-store
photographs and other promotional costs are expensed when the
marketing campaign commences. Costs associated with the
production of television advertising are   
43 Table of Contents   AMERICAN

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   expensed over the life of the campaign. All other advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recognized
$749million, $643million and $533million in
advertising expense during Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal
2005, respectively.   Design
Costs   The Company has certain design costs, including compensation,
rent, travel, supplies and samples, which are included in cost
of sales as the respective inventory is sold.   Store
Pre-Opening Costs   Store pre-opening costs consist primarily of rent, advertising,
supplies and payroll expenses. These costs are expensed as
incurred.   Other
Income, Net   Other income, net consists primarily of interest income as well
as foreign currency transaction gain/loss and interest expense.
As of July8, 2007, the Company discontinued assessing a
service fee on inactive gift cards. Prior to July8, 2007,
the Company recorded gift card service fee income in other
income, net. The Company recorded gift card service fee income
of $08million, $23million and $24million in
Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively.   Gift
Cards   The value of a gift card is recorded as a current liability upon
purchase, and revenue is recognized when the gift card is
redeemed for merchandise. Prior to July8, 2007, if a gift
card remained inactive for greater than 24months, the
Company assessed the recipient a one-dollar per month service
fee, where allowed by law, which was automatically deducted from
the remaining value of the card. For those jurisdictions where
assessing a service fee was not allowable by law, the estimated
breakage was recorded in a manner consistent with that described
above, starting after 24months of inactivity. Both gift
card service fees and breakage estimates were recorded within
other income, net.   On July8, 2007, the Company discontinued assessing a
service fee on inactive gift cards. As a result, the Company
estimates gift card breakage and recognizes revenue in
proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net
sales. The Company determines an estimated gift card breakage
rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and
the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will
be redeemed. The Company recorded $131million of revenue
related to gift card breakage during Fiscal 2007, which included
cumulative breakage revenue related to gift cards issued since
the Company introduced its gift card program.   Legal
Proceedings and Claims   The Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and claims
arising out of the conduct of its business. In accordance with
SFASNo5, Accounting for Contingencies,
management records a reserve for estimated losses when the loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a
range of possible loss exists and no anticipated loss within the
range is more likely than any other anticipated loss, the
Company records the accrual at the low end of the range, in
accordance with FASB Interpretation No14, Reasonable
Estimation of the Amount of a Loss an interpretation
of FASB Statement No5. As the Company believes that
it has provided adequate reserves, it anticipates that the
ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against the
Company will not materially affect the financial position or
results of operations of the Company.

Payable and Other Credit Arrangements   Unsecured
Demand Lending Arrangement   During Fiscal 2007, the Company reduced the amount available
under its unsecured credit facility to $1000million and
eliminated a $400million unsecured demand line of credit
under the facility. The interest rate on the facility is at the
lenders prime lending rate 600% at February2,
2008or at LIBOR plus a negotiated margin rate. Because
there were no direct borrowings during any of the past three
years, there were no amounts paid for interest on this facility.
At February2, 2008, $66million was outstanding on
the facility, leaving a remaining available balance of
$934million.   Uncommitted
Letter of Credit Facility   During Fiscal 2006, the Company received a temporary increase in
the amount available for letters of credit under its uncommitted
letter of credit facility with a separate financial institution.
This increase will be used to support commitments for
merchandise inventory purchases and will remain in place until
terminated by the Company. As a result of the increase, the
Company has an uncommitted letter of credit facility for
$1000million. At February2, 2008, letters of credit
for $280million were outstanding on this facility,
leaving a remaining available balance on the line of
$720million.   Pennsylvania
Industrial Development Authority Loan   During Fiscal 2006, the Company entered into an agreement with
the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority
PIDA to borrow approximately $22million
with a fixed interest rate of 325% and a maturity date of
October1, 2021. The proceeds from the PIDA loan were
restricted for construction costs related to the Companys

Leases   The Company leases all store premises, some of its office space
and certain information technology and office equipment. The
store leases generally have initial terms of ten years. Most of
these store leases provide for base rentals and the payment of a
percentage of sales as additional contingent rent when sales
exceed specified levels. Additionally, most leases contain
construction allowances
and/or rent
holidays. In recognizing landlord incentives and minimum rent
expense, the Company amortizes the charges on a straight-line
basis over the lease term including the pre-opening build-out
period. These leases are classified as operating leases.   A summary of fixed minimum and contingent rent expense for all
operating leases follows

Share-Based
Payments   At February2, 2008, the Company had awards outstanding
under three share-based compensation plans, which are described
below. Prior to Fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for these
plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB
No25, and related interpretations, as permitted by
SFASNo123. No share-based employee compensation
cost related to stock options was recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations prior to Fiscal 2006, as all options
granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the
market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

EAGLE OUTFITTERS, INC.
NOTESTO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   At the beginning of Fiscal 2006, the Company adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of
SFASNo123R
, using the modified prospective transition method. Under
this transition method, share-based compensation cost recognized
includes: acompensation cost for all share-based
payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
January29, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123 and bcompensation cost for all
share-based payments granted subsequent to January29,
2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes
compensation expense for stock option awards and time-based
restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the award or to an employees
eligible retirement date, if earlier. Performance-based
restricted stock awards are recognized as compensation expense
based on the fair value of the Companys common stock on
the date of grant, the number of shares ultimately expected to
vest and the vesting period. Total share-based compensation
expense included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
for Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 was
$337million $207million, net of tax,
$366million $226million, net of tax and
$196million $121million, net of tax,
respectively. In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method of SFASNo123R, financial
results for prior periods have not been restated.   Prior to Fiscal 2006, for pro forma reporting purposes, the
Company had followed the nominal vesting period approach for
stock-based compensation awards with retirement eligibility
provisions. Under this approach, the Company recognized
compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. If an
employee retired before the end of the vesting period, any
remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized at the
date of retirement. SFASNo123R requires
recognition of compensation cost under a non-substantive vesting
period approach. This approach requires recognition of
compensation expense over the period from the grant date to the
date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to
occur during the nominal vesting period. Additionally, for
awards granted to retirement eligible employees, the full
compensation cost of an award must be recognized immediately
upon grant. Had the Company applied the non-substantive vesting
period approach for retirement eligible employees, there would
not have been an impact to our reported pro forma income per
common share for Fiscal 2005. In accordance with
SFASNo123R, beginning in Fiscal 2006, the Company
applies the non-substantive vesting period approach to new stock
award grants that have retirement eligibility provisions.   The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
income per common share as if the Company had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of SFASNo123 to
employee stock options granted in all periods presented. For
purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the fair value for these
options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model and amortized to expense over the
options vesting period.

12,150,000 incentive or non-qualified options to purchase common
stock. The 1994 Plan was subsequently amended to increase the
shares available for grant to 24,300,000shares.
Additionally, the amendment provided that the maximum number of
options that may be granted to any individual may not exceed
8,100,000shares. The options granted under the 1994 Plan
were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board,
primarily vest over five years, and expire ten years from the
date of grant. The 1994 Plan terminated on January2, 2004
with all rights of the optionees and all unexpired options
continuing in force and operation after the termination.   1999
Stock Incentive Plan   The 1999 Stock Option Plan the 1999 Plan was
approved by the stockholders on June8, 1999. The 1999 Plan
authorized 18,000,000shares for issuance in the form of
stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
awards, performance units or performance shares. The 1999 Plan
was subsequently amended to increase the shares available for
grant to 33,000,000. Additionally, the 1999 Plan provided that
the maximum number of shares awarded to any individual may not
exceed 9,000,000shares. The 1999 Plan allowed the
Compensation Committee to determine which employees and
consultants received awards and the terms and conditions of
these awards. The 1999 Plan provided for a grant of 1,875 stock
options quarterly not to be adjusted for stock splits to each
director who is not an officer or employee of the Company
starting in August 2003. The Company ceased making these
quarterly stock option grants in June 2005. Under this plan,
33,159,233 non-qualified stock options and 6,708,369shares
of restricted stock were granted to employees and certain
non-employees without considering cancellations to date of
awards for 7,847,643shares. Approximately 33% of the
options granted were to vest over eight years after the date of
grant but were accelerated as the Company met annual performance
goals. Approximately 34% of the options granted under the 1999
Plan vest over three years, 23% vest over five years and the
remaining grants vest over one year. All options expire after
ten years. Performance-based restricted stock was earned if the
Company met established performance goals. The 1999 Plan

the termination.   2005
Stock Award and Incentive Plan   The 2005 Stock Award and Incentive Plan the 2005

issuance, of which 6,375,000shares are available for full
value awards in the form of restricted stock awards, restricted
stock units or other full value stock awards and
12,000,000shares are available for stock options, stock
appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, performance awards or
other non-full value stock awards. The 2005 Plan provides that
the maximum number of shares awarded to any individual may not
exceed 6,000,000shares per year plus the amount of the
unused annual limit of the previous year. The 2005 Plan allows
the Compensation Committee to determine which employees receive
awards and the terms and conditions of these awards. The 2005
Plan provides for grants to directors who are not officers or
employees of the Company, which are not to exceed
20,000shares per year not to be adjusted for stock
splits. Through February2, 2008, 5,635,247 non-qualified

granted for ten and seven-year terms. Approximately 95% of the
restricted stock awards are performance-based and are earned if

No.FAS109-2,
Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 FSP
No109-2.
FSP
No109-2
provides guidance to companies to determine how the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act affects a
companys accounting for the deferred tax liabilities on
un-remitted foreign earnings. The Act provides for a special
one-time deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated and that meet certain requirements. During Fiscal
2006, the Company repatriated $834million as
extraordinary dividends from its Canadian subsidiaries. As a
result of the repatriation, the Company recognized total income
tax expense of $44million, of which $38million was
recorded during Fiscal 2005 and $06million was recorded
during Fiscal 2006.   The decision to take advantage of the special one-time deduction
under the Act was a discrete event, and it has not changed the
Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest accumulated
earnings from its Canadian operations to the extent not
repatriated under the Act. U.S.income taxes have not been
provided on undistributed earnings of our Canadian subsidiaries.
It is not practicable, at this time, to estimate the amount of
tax if any that might be payable. Our intention is to reinvest
these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only
when it is tax effective to do so. Accordingly, we believe that
any U.S.income tax on repatriated earnings would be
substantially offset by U.S.foreign income tax credits.   Effective February4, 2007, the Company adopted
FIN48, which prescribes a comprehensive model for
recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the
financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken
on a tax return, including a decision whether to file or not to
file in a particular jurisdiction. Under FIN48, a tax
benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it
is more likely than not that the position is
sustainable based on its technical merits.   As a result of adopting FIN48, the Company recorded a net
liability of approximately $133million for unrecognized
tax benefits, which was accounted for as a reduction to the
beginning balance of retained earnings as of February4,
2007. As of February4, 2007, the gross amount of
unrecognized tax benefits was $393million, of which
$276million would affect the effective tax rate if
recognized. The gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of
February2, 2008 was $430million, of which
$252million would affect the effective tax rate if
recognized.   The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had
approximately $88million in interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of
February4, 2007. The amount of accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of
February2, 2008 was $112million.   The following table summarizes the activity related to our
unrecognized tax benefits

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the
U.S.federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign
jurisdictions. The examination of the Companys
U.S.federal income tax returns for tax years ended July
2003 to July 2005 were substantially completed in January 2008.
The IRS examination has been resolved except for one unagreed
item on which the Company will file a protest with IRS Appeals.
The Company believes its reserves are adequate to cover the
ultimate resolution. An examination of the July 2006 return is
scheduled to start in the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. The
Company does not anticipate that any adjustments will result in
a material change to its financial position or results of
operations. All years prior to July 2003 are no longer subject
to U.S.federal income tax examinations by tax authorities.
With respect to state and local jurisdictions and countries
outside of the United States, with limited exceptions,
generally, the Company and its subsidiaries are no longer
subject to income tax audits for tax years before 2001. Although
the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company
believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties
have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to
result from these years.   The Company placed the second phase of its Ottawa distribution
center into service in May 2007. As a result, the Company is
eligible for approximately $25million of nonrefundable
incentive tax credits in Kansas. These credits can be utilized
to offset future Kansas income taxes and will expire in
10years. These available credits are not currently
utilizable due to existing credit carryovers and the level of
income taxes paid to Kansas. Additionally, the use of credits is
dependent upon our meeting certain requirements in future
periods. Due to the contingencies related to the future use of
these credits, we believe it is more likely than not that the
benefit of this asset will not be realized within the
carryforward period. Thus, a full valuation allowance of
$25million has been recorded during the year ended
February2, 2008. The Company may earn additional credits
or change its assessment of the valuation allowance if certain
employment and training requirements are met.   A reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate
and the effective tax rate from continuing operations follows

Subsequent
Event   Auction
Rate Securities   On February2, 2008, the Company had a total of
approximately $786million in cash and cash equivalents,
short-term and long-term investments, which included
approximately $418million of investments in auction rate
securities ARS.   Beginning February12, 2008 through March25, 2008,
the Company has experienced failed auctions for 36 ARS issues
representing principal and accrued interest in the total amount
of $2725million. During this time, we have also sold nine
ARS issues, at par plus accrued interest, for a total of
$366million. We believe that the current lack of
liquidity relating to our ARS investments will have no impact on
our ability to fund our ongoing operations and growth
initiatives.   As of March25, 2008, our ARS portfolio totaled
approximately $373million. This amount includes
approximately 46% federally insured student loan backed
securities, 41% municipal and education authority

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   bonds and 13% dividend received auction rate preferred
securities. Our ARS portfolio is comprised of approximately 69%
AAA rated investments, 20% AA rated investments and 11% A rated
investments.   Based on our belief that our ARS investments can be liquidated
through successful auctions or redemptions at par plus accrued
interest, and on our ability and intent to hold such investments
until liquidation, we believe that the current illiquidity of
these investments is temporary. However, we will reassess this
conclusion in future reporting periods based on several factors,
including the success or failure of future auctions, possible
failure of the investment to be redeemed, deterioration of the
credit ratings of the investments, market risk and other
factors. Such a reassessment may change the classification of
these investments to long-term or result in a conclusion that
these investments are impaired. If we determine that the fair
value of these auction rate securities is temporarily impaired,
we would record a temporary impairment within other
comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity.
If it is determined that the fair value of these securities is
other-than-temporarily
impaired, we would record a loss in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations, which could materially adversely impact our
results of operations and financial condition.   Credit
Facilities   Subsequent to Fiscal 2007, we reinstated the $400million
line and increased the amount available to $750million as
part of the facility. Additionally, we borrowed
$750million on this line and used the proceeds to
increase our cash position to add financial flexibility. The
interest rate on the borrowing is at the lenders prime
lending rate minus 100%.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES.   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. the Management,
including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, Management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives.   In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K
as of February2, 2008, an evaluation was performed under
the supervision and with the participation of our Management,
including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in
Rule13a-15e
under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our
Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on
Form10-K.   Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   Our Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in
Rule13a-15f
under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide a reasonable assurance to our
Management and our Board regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of published financial statements.   All internal control systems, no matter how well designed have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.   Our Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of February2, 2008. In
making this assessment, our Management used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control
Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, our Management
concluded that we maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of February2, 2008.   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the three months ended February2, 2008
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   
61 Table of Contents   Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of   American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.   We have audited American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of February2, 2008,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
American Eagle Outfitters Inc.s the Company management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of February2, 2008, based on the COSO
criteria.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.
as of February2, 2008 and February3, 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive
income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended February2, 2008
of American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. and our report dated
March26, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.   /s/Ernst
