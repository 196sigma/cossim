REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Brooks Automation, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of changes in stockholders' equity, and
of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Brooks Automation, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 30, 1999 and 1998,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended September 30, 1999, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF THE BUSINESS
Brooks Automation, Inc. the Company is an independent supplier of tool
and factory hardware and software automation solutions for the global
semiconductor, data storage and flat panel display manufacturing industries.
Founded in 1978, the Company has distinguished itself as a technology and market
leader, particularly in the cluster-tool vacuum-processing environment and in
integrated factory automation software applications. In 1998 and 1999 the
Company has diversified and entered the factory automation market, beginning
with the acquisition of FASTech Integration, Inc. FASTech. Through a recent
series of acquisitions, Brooks has emerged as one of the largest suppliers of
automation software solutions to end users in the semiconductor, electronics and
general discrete manufacturing industries.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions are eliminated.
On April 2, and June 30, 1999, the Company completed the acquisitions of
Hanyon Technology, Inc. Hanyon and certain assets and liabilities of Domain
Manufacturing Corporation Domain, respectively. On September 30, 1999, the
Company acquired certain assets of the Infab Division Infab of Jenoptik AG
see note 3. These transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations and
of Cash Flows include the results of these companies for the periods subsequent
to their respective dates of acquisition.
On August 31, 1999, the Company acquired Smart Machines Inc. Smart
Machines in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests see note
3. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been restated to include the financial position and results of
operations of Smart Machines for all periods prior to the acquisition.
Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to current presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Although the Company regularly assesses these estimates, actual results
could differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are recorded in the
period in which they become known.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales and software license sales is recorded upon
shipment to the customer provided that no significant obligations remain and
collection of the related receivable is probable. When insignificant obligations
remain after shipment of the product, the Company accrues the estimated costs of
such obligations upon shipment. A provision for product warranty costs is
recorded to estimate costs associated with such warranty
39
41
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
liabilities. In the event significant post-shipment obligations or uncertainties
remain, revenue is deferred and recognized when such obligations are fulfilled
by the Company or the uncertainties are resolved.
Revenue from services is recognized as the services are rendered. Revenue
from fixed fee application consulting contracts is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting based on the ratio that
costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion. Revisions in
revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that
require such revisions become known. Losses, if any, are provided for in the
period in which such losses are first identified by management. For maintenance
contracts, service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the
maintenance contract.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company invests its excess cash in repurchase agreements with major
banks, U.S. government and corporate securities, and mutual funds that invest in
U.S. government securities, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September 30, 1999,
all cash and cash equivalents were classified as available-for-sale and as items
for which cost approximates fair value. At September 30, 1998, cash and cash
equivalents include $456 million and $239 million of securities which are
classified as available-for-sale and held to maturity, respectively, and for
which cost approximates fair value.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
determined using the first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory
reserves for excess, obsolete or damaged inventory based on changes in customer
demand, technology and other economic factors. While the Company often uses sole
source suppliers for certain key components and common assemblies to achieve
quality control and the benefits of economies of scale, the Company believes
that these parts and materials are readily available from several supply
sources.
FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives, which range from 3 to 5 years for computer equipment and software,
5 to 7 years for machinery and equipment, and 3 to 10 years for furniture and
fixtures using the straight-line method. Equipment held under capital leases is
recorded at the lower of the fair market value of the equipment or the present
value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the leases. Leasehold
improvements and equipment held under capital leases are amortized over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale,
the cost of the assets disposed and the related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged
to operations.
PATENTS
Patents includes capitalized direct costs associated with obtaining patents
as well as assets that were acquired as a part of purchase business
combinations. Capitalized patent costs are amortized using the straight-line
method over the shorter of seven years or the estimated economic life of the
patents. Acquired patent costs are amortized over three years using the
straight-line method. As of September 30, 1999 and 1998, the net book value of
the Company capitalized costs, included in Intangible assets included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, were $61 million and $09 million,
respectively. Amortization expense associated with recorded patents
40
42
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
was $03 million and $02 million in the years ended September 30, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $10 million and $07 million
at September 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
GOODWILL
The Company net book value of excess of purchase cost over the fair value
of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill was $76 million at September
30, 1999. The Company had no goodwill recorded at September 30, 1998. Goodwill
is being amortized over the periods estimated to be benefitted, from three to
five years. Amortization expense was $03 million for the year ended September
30, 1999. The Company will periodically evaluate goodwill to determine if
impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows, net of
taxes, over the remaining useful life of the assets. The impairment, if any,
will be measured by the difference between carrying value and estimated
discounted future cash flows, net of taxes, and will be charged to expense in
the period identified.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company products
are expensed as incurred, except for certain software development costs.
Software development costs are expensed prior to establishing technological
feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the related product is available
for general release to customers. Capitalized software development costs are
amortized to cost of sales on a product-by-product basis over the estimated
lives of the related products. Such costs have not been significant to date.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company stock compensation plans are accounted for in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Under this method, compensation expense on stock option grants to
employees for a fixed number of shares is recognized only to the extent that the
exercise price on the date of grant is less than the current fair market value
of the Company common stock. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, FAS 123 for fixed stock-based awards to
employees. All non-employee stock-based awards are accounted for in accordance
with FAS 123.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences, utilizing current tax rates, of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are recognized, net of any valuation allowance for the
estimated future tax effects of deductible temporary differences and tax
operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense or benefit
represents the change in the net deferred tax asset and liability balances.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The functional currency of the Company international subsidiaries is the
local currency. Accordingly, foreign currency financial statements of the
Company international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using
exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average
rates during the period for results of operations. The resulting foreign
currency translation adjustments are reflected as accumulated other
41
43
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
comprehensive income loss. Foreign currency translation adjustments are the
only component added to the Company net loss in the calculation of
comprehensive net loss.
LOSS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive
common equivalent shares assumed outstanding during the period. Shares used to
compute diluted earnings per share in loss years exclude common share
equivalents, as their inclusion would have an anti-dilutive effect. The
Company net loss, for purposes of calculating basic and diluted loss per
share, has been adjusted by accretion and dividends related to the Company
preferred stock.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions, which addresses
software revenue recognition as it applies to certain multiple-element
arrangements. SOP 98-9 also amends SOP 98-4, Deferral of the Effective Date of
a Provision of SOP 97-2, to extend the deferral of application of certain
passages of SOP 97-2 through fiscal years beginning on or before March 15, 1999.
All other provisions of SOP 98-9 are effective for transactions entered into in
fiscal years beginning after March 15, 1999. The Company will comply with the
requirements of this SOP as they become effective and does not expect that its
revenues or earnings will be materially affected.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities FAS 133. This statement was amended by the issuance of SFAS 137,
Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which changed the
effective date of SFAS 133 to all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000
fiscal 2001 for the Company and requires that all derivative instruments be
recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive
income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge
transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. Management of the
Company anticipates that the adoption of FAS 133 will not have a significant
effect on the Company results of operations or financial position.
3. ACQUISITIONS

RIGHTS DISTRIBUTION
In July 1997, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right a right for each share of common stock outstanding on
August 12, 1997. Each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company, upon certain triggering events, one one-thousandth of a share of Series
A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share the Series A
Preferred Shares, of the Company, at a purchase price of $135 per one
one-thousandth of a Series A Preferred Share, subject to adjustment. Redemption
of the rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving the
securities of the Company that is not approved by the Company Board of
Directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and,
accordingly, could have an adverse impact on stockholders who might want to vote
in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer. The rights will
expire on the earlier of i July 31, 2007, or ii the date on which the rights
are redeemed. The terms of the rights may generally be amended by the Board of
Directors without the consent of the holders of the rights.

One of the Company directors is an executive with one of the Company
customers. Net revenue recognized from this customer was $153 million, $159
million, and $182 million in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Amounts
due from this customer included in accounts receivable at September 30, 1999 and
1998, were $34 and $24 million, respectively. Related party amounts included
in accounts receivable are on standard terms and manner of settlement.
In fiscal 1999, two other customers each accounted for more than 10% of the
Company revenues. The Company did not have any other single customer that
accounted for more than 10% of the Company net revenues in fiscal 1998 or
fiscal 1997.

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
A financial instrument which potentially exposes the Company to
concentration of credit risk is accounts receivable, as the Company customers
are concentrated in the semiconductor industry and relatively few customers
account for a significant portion of the Company revenues. The Company
regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and believes that it
has adequately provided for exposure to potential credit losses.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company leases manufacturing and office facilities and certain
equipment under operating and capital leases that expire through 2005. Rent
expense under operating leases for fiscal 1999, fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997 was
$41 million, $48 million and $33 million, respectively. Future minimum lease
payments under operating and capital leases with initial or remaining
noncancelable terms of one or more years are as follows as of September 30, 1999

Total amounts to be received under subleases are $12 million in fiscal
2000.
CONTINGENCY
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other
intellectual property rights in the semiconductor and related industries. The
Company has received notice from a third-party alleging infringements of such
party patent rights by certain of the Company products. The Company patent
counsel is investigating the claim and the Company believes the patents claimed
may be invalid. In the event of litigation with respect to this claim, the
Company is prepared to vigorously defend its position. However, because patent
litigation can be extremely expensive and time consuming, the Company may seek
to obtain a license to one or more of the disputed patents. Based upon currently
available information, the Company would only do so if such license fees would
not be material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Currently,
the Company does not believe that it is probable that future events related to
this threatened matter will have an adverse effect on the Company business.
17. ACQUISITION-RELATED AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS
During fiscal 1999, the Company recorded acquisition-related and
restructuring costs of $31 million. These costs reflect $12 million of legal,
accounting and other costs associated with acquiring Smart Machines. In

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
addition, the Company approved and implemented a restructuring program designed
to integrate its current year acquisitions. These actions involved 7 employees,
all of whom were terminated prior to September 30, 1999 and the write-off of
certain fixed assets prior to September 30, 1999. Accordingly, during fiscal
1999, the Company recorded a charge of $19 million related to the restructuring
program.
During fiscal year 1999, the Company recorded $29 million of costs in
purchase accounting transactions consisting of $24 million for severance costs
related to former employees and $05 million to exit certain duplicate
facilities.
During fiscal year 1998, the Company approved and implemented a
restructuring program designed to align the Company cost structure with lower
revenue levels indicative of the recent decline in demand for semiconductor
equipment. These actions involved approximately 120 employees, all of whom were
terminated prior to September 30, 1998. Accordingly, during fiscal 1998, the
Company recorded a charge of $13 million related to the restructuring program,
primarily for employee severance costs.
In addition, during 1998, the Company recorded charges of $14 million in
connection with its acquisition of FASTech, reflecting estimated costs to exit
duplicate facilities. This amount is primarily comprised of estimated lease
costs on FASTech former headquarters facility. The Company also recorded
charges of $10 million related to legal, accounting and other costs in
connection with the FASTech acquisition.

In September 1999, the Company obtained a commitment letter for an
unsecured revolving credit facility for borrowings and letters of credit up to
$300 million. The credit facility will terminate at the end of two years.

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The interest rates for borrowings are expressed in relation to LIBOR and a
margin of 175% to 225% or from 025% to 075% above a base rate. The letter of
credit margin rates are from 175% to 225%. The borrowings and letters of
credit are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate
purposes, including financing potential acquisitions.
On December 15, 1999, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire Auto-Soft Corporation and AutoSimulations, Inc. from their sole
stockholder, Daifuku America Corporation, subject to the satisfaction of
customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company
will be required to pay $270 million in cash, issue shares of common stock with
an aggregate value of $160 million; such number of shares to be determined as
of the closing date in accordance with the agreement, and issue a note in the
amount of $160 million payable one year from the date of closing. The note will
be unsecured and bear interest at 40% per year. Auto-Soft Corporation develops
and markets custom designed software and standard software for automated
material handling applications. AutoSimulations, Inc. develops and markets
industrial simulation and semiconductor factory scheduling software. The
transaction is expected to be completed in January 2000 and will be accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting.
