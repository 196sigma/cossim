To the Shareholders and
Board of Directors of
Delco Remy International, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delco Remy
International, Inc. as of December 31, 2000 and July 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit,
and cash flows for the five months ended December 31, 2000 and for each of the
three years in the period ended July 31, 2000. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Delco Remy International, Inc. at December 31, 2000 and July 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the five
months ended December 31, 2000 and for each of the three years in the period
ended July 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.                              /S/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP

1. ORGANIZATION AND ACQUISITIONS
See Note 18 for a discussion of the Company acquisition by Court Square
Capital Limited Court Square, the subsequent merger of a subsidiary of Court
Squarer into the Company and the Company recapitalization, all effective March
14, 2000.
Delco Remy America Acquisition
On August 1, 1994, Delco Remy International, Inc. the Company or DRI
through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Delco Remy America, Inc. DRA, purchased
substantially all of the assets, other than facilities, and assumed certain
liabilities of specific business activities of the Delco Remy Division of
General Motors Corporation the GM Acquisition. The specific business
activities purchased are engaged in the design, manufacture, remanufacture and
sale of heavy duty starter motors and generators, automotive starter motors, and
related components.
The aggregate purchase price of the GM Acquisition of $155,665 including
fees and expenses was accounted for as a purchase. The Company issued i
common stock of $1,531, ii preferred stock of $11,507 and iii debt of
$158,200 to fund the purchase and provide capital for general corporate
purposes. The GM Acquisition resulted in the recording of approximately $17,600
of goodwill which is being amortized over 15 years. While the GM Acquisition was
recorded based on the best estimates available, certain purchase price
adjustments as of the August 1, 1994 purchase date have not been determined or
agreed to by General Motors Corporation GM and DRI. When finalized, the
resolution of these items could result in a charge or credit to operations,
which the Company does not expect to be material. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements reflect the consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the Company subsequent to the GM Acquisition. The Company had no
operations prior to August 1, 1994.
GM is entitled to receive an additional contingent purchase payment which
will be paid beginning in 2004 and will be based upon a percentage of average
earnings of the Company in the three year period ending December 31, 2003 in
excess of certain imputed earnings. Since the additional contingent purchase
price, if any, is based upon future operations of the Company which cannot be
determined at this time, no provision for such payment has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. The additional contingent
purchase price, if any, will increase the goodwill recorded for the GM
Acquisition and will be amortized over the remaining useful life of the GM
Acquisition goodwill.
Concurrent with the GM Acquisition, the Company entered into certain supply
agreements with GM whereby the Company would be the sole-source supplier to GM
for component parts manufactured by the Company at the date of the GM
Acquisition. The supply agreement for automotive starter motors has an initial
term of ten years, while the supply agreement for heavy duty starter motors and
generators had an initial term of six years. In fiscal year 1999, the Company
and GM amended the agreement for the Company price of automotive products and
extended the agreement term to August 31, 2008. The Supply Agreement for heavy
duty products terminated on July 31, 2000. Sales to GM were not adversely
affected and the Company now has the ability to provide an expanded heavy duty
product offering to GM and other customers. GM obligations to distribute the
Company automotive aftermarket products terminates on July 31, 2009. Fiscal Year 2000 Acquisitions
In August 1999, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased the
assets of Engine Master, a remanufacturer of gasoline engines located in Dallas,
Texas, for $5,844 in cash. The acquisition was treated as a purchase for
accounting purposes and resulted in goodwill of $1,076 which is being amortized
over 35 years.
In March 2000, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 100%
of the capital shares of M Knopf Auto Parts, Inc. Knopf from certain
shareholders. The purchase price of $61,322, net of cash acquired and including
the payoff of certain debt of Knopf, was funded through proceeds from the
Company Senior Credit Facility and is subject to certain adjustments. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. Resulting goodwill of approximately
$37,000 is
29 being amortized over 30 years. The purchase price is subject to an additional
contingent payment of cash and/or common stock of the Company in fiscal year
2005, subject to the achievement by Knopf of certain earnings goals. The amount
of this payment cannot currently be determined. This additional contingent
purchase price, if any, will increase the goodwill recorded for the acquisition
and will be amortized over its remaining useful life. Results of operations for
Knopf are included in the Company financial statements effective March 10,
2000. Knopf is engaged in automotive component recovery and exchange.
In April 2000, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 100%
of the capital shares of Elmot-DR Sp z.o.o, a Polish manufacturer of starters
and alternators for the OEM and aftermarket in Europe, for $839 in cash, net of
cash acquired. The acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes
with no resulting goodwill.
Fiscal Year 1999 Acquisitions
On November 13, 1998, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
purchased all of the common stock of Williams Technologies, Inc. Williams
for $38,840 in cash, net of cash acquired and less Williams' intercompany and
third-party debt. The purchase was funded through proceeds from the Company
Senior Credit Facility. The acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting
purposes and resulted in goodwill of $21,104 which is being amortized over 35
years. Williams is a remanufacturer of automatic transmissions and torque
converters for automotive and medium and heavy duty truck applications. Its
primary market is the dealer network of major North American and foreign
original equipment vehicle manufacturers. Results of operations for Williams are
included in the Company consolidated results from the acquisition date.
On June 25, 1999, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased
31% of the capital shares of Delco Remy Korea formerly Remy Korea Limited from
certain shareholders for $6,204 in cash, net of cash acquired. The purchase was
funded through proceeds from the Company Senior Credit Facility. This
investment increased the Company ownership position in Delco Remy Korea to
81%. The acquisition was treated as a purchase for accounting purposes with no
resulting goodwill. During fiscal year 1997, the Company acquired a 50% interest
in Delco Remy Korea for approximately $5,300. Effective June 25, 1999, the
Company accounted for Delco Remy Korea as a consolidated subsidiary. It was
accounted for under the equity method prior to that date. Delco Remy Korea is a
manufacturer of automotive starter motors and parts for the U.S. original
equipment market, as well as customers in Asian markets.
Fiscal Year 1998 Acquisitions and Investments
On December 22, 1997, the Company acquired all of the capital stock of
Ballantrae for $53,900, including assumed debt, a working capital adjustment and
fees and expenses. The Company exchanged 1,918,623 shares of its Common Stock
with a value of approximately $23,023 for the equity of Ballantrae and repaid
approximately $29,500 of Ballantrae debt. The acquisition was treated as a
purchase for accounting purposes and is included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company beginning with the acquisition date. The acquisition
resulted in goodwill of $24,580, which is being amortized over 35 years.
Ballantrae operates through two subsidiaries: Tractech, a leading producer of
traction control systems for heavy duty original equipment manufacturers and the
aftermarket; and Kraftube, Inc., a tubing assembly business which sells products
to compressor manufacturers for commercial air conditioners and refrigeration
equipment.
On March 5, 1998, the Company acquired certain assets from Atlantic Reman
Limited, which is a Canadian Ford Authorized Remanufacturer for the Maritime
Provinces in Canada, for $1,277. It remanufactures and distributes engines,
starters, alternators and water pumps to Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler
dealers in Canada.
In March 1998, the Company acquired 37% of Sahney Paris Rhone Ltd. SPR, an
Indian remanufacturer of starters and alternators which sells principally to the
Indian market. SPR is accounted for under the equity method.
The Company acquired the starter and alternator remanufacturing operations of
Lucas Varity in the United Kingdom on April 6, 1998. The purchase price was
$4,773 including fees and expenses, and resulting goodwill of $535 is being
amortized over 35 years. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and is
included in the consolidated financial statements from date of acquisition.
Located in England, the Lucas line of remanufactured starters and alternators is
a market leader in the U.K. independent aftermarket.
On July 16, 1998, the Company acquired Electro Diesel Rebuild EDR in
Belgium and Electro Rebuild Tunisia located in Tunisia, which produce heavy duty
and automotive starters and alternators for the European replacement market.
30 The purchase price was $7,586 including fees and expenses and was funded by
the proceeds from a loan facility. Resulting goodwill of $4,663 is being
amortized over 35 years. The acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase
and is included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
acquisition.

The pro forma consolidated financial information has been prepared for
comparative purposes only and does not purport to present what the Company
consolidated results of operations would actually have been if the operations
were combined during the periods presented and is not intended to project future
results or trends of operations. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DRI and its
subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
The Company changed its fiscal year to December 31, effective August 1, 2000.
Prior to August 1, 2000, the fiscal year ended on July 31. Accordingly, the
Company audited financial statements include a balance sheet at December 31,
2000 and statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
five-month transition period ended December 31, 2000. For comparative purposes,
the Company has included unaudited statements of operations and cash flows for
the five-month period ended December 31, 1999.
Nature of Operations
The Company designs, manufactures, remanufactures and distributes electrical,
powertrain/drivetrain and related components and provides core exchange services
for automobiles and light trucks, medium- and heavy-duty trucks and other heavy-
duty and industrial applications. Products include starter motors, alternators,
engines, transmissions, torque converters, fuel systems and traction control
systems. The Company serves the aftermarket and original equipment manufacturer
market, principally in North America, as well as Europe, Latin America and Asia
Pacific.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes all cash balances and highly liquid
investments held primarily in repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S.
Government securities with a maturity of ninety days or less when purchased. The
carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Other Risks
Substantially all of the Company accounts receivable are due from customers
in the original equipment and aftermarket automotive industries, both in the
U.S. and internationally. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of
its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
Credit losses are provided for in the financial
31 statements and have been consistently within management expectations. The
Company invests its temporary cash in high credit quality financial institutions
and investment grade short- term investments and limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one entity.
The percentage of the Company labor force covered by a collective bargaining
agreement is 258%. None of the agreements expires within one year.
The Company conducts a significant portion of its business with GM. See Note
11.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Effective August 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires that all derivatives be
recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair values of
derivatives are accounted for based upon their intended use and designation.
In the normal course of business, operations of the Company are exposed to
continuing fluctuations in foreign currency values, interest rates and commodity
prices that can affect the cost of operating, investing and financing.
Accordingly, the Company addresses a portion of these risks through a controlled
program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial
instruments. The Company objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow
volatility associated with these fluctuations. The Company derivative
activities, all of which are for purposes other than trading, are initiated
within the guidelines of established policies and procedures designed to manage
market risk. The Company does not enter into any derivative transactions for
speculative purposes. From time to time, the Company enters into foreign
currency exchange agreements to manage its exposure arising from fluctuating
exchange rates related to specific transactions.
In order to hedge anticipated U.S. dollar-denominated intercompany sales of
inventory by its Korean subsidiary to a U.S. subsidiary against fluctuations
between the Korean Won and U.S. dollar, the company has entered into a series of
non-deliverable currency forward contracts. At maturity, each contract is
settled at the difference between fair value and contract value. These
derivative contracts have been designated as a cash flow hedge and, accordingly,
changes in fair value are charged to other comprehensive income see Note 10.
Realized gains and losses recorded upon settlement are charged to earnings in
the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flows
of the settled intercompany sale. In November 2000, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap to hedge the exposure on a portion of the variable rate debt.
The swap converts the libor-based rate to a fixed rate of 651% on debt of
$100,000 for a period of two years. This swap has been designated as a cash flow
hedge and changes in fair value are charged to other comprehensive income see
Note 10. Realized gains and losses are charged to earnings as interest expense
in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash
flows of the interest paid. The notional amounts of the Company foreign
exchange contracts are summarized as follows                    December 31         July 31
2000       2000       1999
Book   Fair   Book   Fair   Book  Fair
Value  Value  Value  Value  Value  Value
Forwards          $ 6,353 $ 5,914 $ 6,436 $ 6,048 $6,179 $6,259
Non-deliverable forwards   37,536  33,152  62,602  62,829   --    The market value of the interest rate swap at December 31, 2000 was $1,500.
Inventories
Inventories are carried at lower of cost or market determined on the first-in,
first-out FIFO method. Raw materials also include supplies and repair parts
which consist of materials consumed in the manufacturing process but not
directly incorporated into the finished products. Inventories at December 31,
2000 and July 31, 2000 and 1999 consist of the following               December 31   July 31
2000   2000   1999
Raw materials     $154,550 $132,713 $121,725
Work-in-process     51,668  52,605  50,725
Finished goods     87,606  82,835  59,715
$293,824 $268,153 $232,165
32 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and include certain expenditures for
leased facilities. Depreciation is calculated primarily using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 15 to 40 years for
buildings and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of the net
assets acquired and is being amortized by the straight-line method over 15 to 35
years.
The carrying amount of goodwill is regularly reviewed for indicators of
impairment in value, which in the view of management are other than temporary,
including unexpected or adverse changes in the following: i the economic or
competitive environments in which the Company operates; ii profitability
analysis and iii cash flow analysis. If facts and circumstances suggest that a
subsidiary net assets are impaired, the Company assesses the fair value of the
underlying business and reduces goodwill to an amount that results in the book
value of the subsidiary approximating fair value.
Investments in Joint Ventures
Investments in companies representing an ownership interest of 20% to 50% are
accounted for by the equity method. Joint ventures consisted of a 37% interest
in Sahney Paris Rhone Ltd. SPR in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 and a 50%
interest in Delco Remy Korea through June 25, 1999. Subsequent to that date,
Delco Remy Korea was accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary see Note 1.
The Company investment in SPR and its share of SPR earnings were not
significant relative to consolidated assets and earnings for the five months
ended December 31, 2000 and in fiscal years 2000 and 1999.
Long-Term Assets
The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations
when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than
the carrying amounts of those assets.
Recognition of Revenue
Substantially all of the Company revenue is recognized at the time product
is shipped. The Company remanufacturing operations obtain used diesel and
gasoline engines, fuel systems, transmissions, starter motors and generators,
commonly known as cores, from its customers as trade-ins. Net sales and cost of
goods sold are reduced by $83,558, $185,324, $156,383, and $160,731 for the five
months ended December 31, 2000 and fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, to reflect the cost of cores for remanufactured product shipped.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities
and at the average exchange rate for each year for revenue and expenses.
Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
equity and reflected in comprehensive income loss.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing
net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of
common stock shares outstanding during the year plus potential dilutive
instruments including stock options, warrants and the Company stock purchase
plan. The effect of warrants and the stock purchase plan on diluted earnings per
share is determined through the application of the treasury stock method,
whereby proceeds received by the Company based on assumed exercises are
hypothetically used to repurchase the Company common stock at the average
market price during the period. Stock options did not affect the calculation of
diluted earnings per share in fiscal years 2000 and 1999 because the exercise
price of stock options outstanding was greater than the market price. Stock
options, warrants, and stock purchase plans did not affect the calculation of
the weighted average shares for the diluted loss per share in fiscal year 1998
because their effect would have been antidilutive.
33  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings

On November 20, 1997, the Company authorized a 168-to-1 stock split which
was effective on December 19, 1997. All share and per share amounts have been
adjusted to reflect this split.
See Note 18 for a discussion of the Company acquisition by Court Square
Capital Limited Court Square, the subsequent merger of a subsidiary of Court
Square into the Company and the Company recapitalization, all effective March
14, 2001.
Comprehensive Income
The Company other comprehensive income consists of unrealized gains and
losses on the translation of the assets and liabilities of its foreign
operations and unrealized gains and losses on currency instruments and interest
rate swaps. See Note 10.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company financial instruments generally consist of cash and cash
equivalents, trade and other receivables, accounts payable and long-term debt.
The fair value of the Company fixed rate debt was estimated using a discounted
cash flow analysis based upon the Company current incremental borrowing rates.
With the exception of the Senior Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, the
carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximated their fair value at
December 31, 2000 and at July 31, 2000 and 1999. At December 31, 2000, the
Senior Notes have a face value of $145,000 and a fair value of $133,067 and the
Senior Subordinated Notes have a face value of $140,000 and a fair value of
$118,146.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expense during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
The Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued a final consensus on EITF 00-10, Accounting for Shipping
and Handling Fees and Costs. This standard addresses the income statement
classification for shipping and handling fees and costs. The Company adopted the
provisions of this standard in the transition period ended December 31, 2000.
Adoption did not have a material effect on the Company financial statements.
34 3.  NON-RECURRING CHARGES
In May 2000, the Company completed plans for the realignment of certain
manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. A
one-time charge of $35,222 was recorded in June 2000 for the estimated cost of
the plan. The reserve included $27,098 for the estimated cost of various
voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs associated with the
resulting workforce reductions. A total of $5,011 was paid in fiscal year 2000 15,961 was paid in the five months ended December 31, 2000 and $3,100, $2,842
and $184 are estimated to be paid in calendar years 2001, 2002 and 2003,
respectively. The reserve also includes $8,124, net of salvage value, for the
write-down of certain production assets which will no longer be used as a result
of the realignment. Additionally, a reserve of $1,050 was established in
connection with the acquisition of Elmot in March 2000.
In May 1998, the Company offered an incentive separation payment to DRA
hourly employees through an employee termination program. A total of 337
employees accepted the Company offer. A reserve of $26,515 was established for
these separation costs, $9,974 of which were paid in fiscal year 1998, $11,565
of which were paid in fiscal year 1999, and $3,889 of which were paid in fiscal
year 2000. An additional $900 was paid in the five months ended December 31,
2000 and $187 will be paid in calendar year 2001.
In May 1997, the Company decided to realign the manufacturing operations of
DRA to utilize focus factory manufacturing concepts and to close the Company
operations in the old vertically-integrated factories that were leased from GM.
These decisions resulted in the impairment of certain production assets with a
carrying amount of $30,321 $25,279 of which was property and equipment and
$5,042 of which was related tooling and other supplies which the Company sold
or otherwise disposed of. In fiscal year 1998, the reserve established for this
charge was reduced $5,366 to reflect the utilization of certain assets
previously targeted for disposal. The Company estimated the loss on disposal
including related costs at $26,260. In addition, the Company estimated a cost of
$8,240 for reducing its workforce through several transition programs. In fiscal
year 1998, this reserve was increased $5,232 to reflect greater than anticipated
participation in the various workforce transition programs. Some of the
operations for the closed facilities were transferred to the new focus factories
and others were outsourced.

7.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Agreements with GM
In connection with the GM Acquisition, the Company and GM agreed to
allocate the responsibility for employee pension benefits and post-retirement
health care and life insurance on a pro-rata basis between DRA and GM. The
allocation is primarily determined upon years of service with DRA and aggregate
years of service with DRA and GM. Effective August 1, 1994, DRA established
hourly and salaried pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance
plans which are similar to the respective GM plans.
Pension and Post-Retirement Health Care and Life Insurance Plans
DRA has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees.
The plan covering salaried employees provides benefits that are based upon years
of service and final estimated average compensation. Benefits for hourly
employees are based on stated amounts for each year of service. DRA funding
policy is to contribute amounts to provide the plans with sufficient assets to
meet future benefit payment requirements consistent with actuarial
determinations of the funding requirements of federal laws. Plan assets are
primarily invested in mutual funds which invest in both debt and equity
instruments.
38   DRA maintains hourly and salaried benefit plans that provide
post-retirement health care and life insurance to retirees and eligible
dependents. The benefits are payable for life, although DRA retains the right to
modify or terminate the plans providing these benefits. The salaried plan has
cost sharing features such as deductibles and co-payments. Salaried employees
who were not GM employees prior to 1992 are not eligible for the above described
post-retirement benefits. It is DRA policy to fund these benefits as claims
are incurred.
The changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, components of expense,
and assumptions for the plans are as follows                                             Post-Retirement Health Care

The rate was assumed to decrease ratably to 525% through 2004 and remain level
at that rate thereafter. An increase and decrease of one-percentage-point in the
assumed health care trend rates would have the following effects on service and
interest cost in the five-month period ended December 31, 2000 and the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2000.                                             1% Increase     1% Decrease

Various subsidiaries of the Company sponsor voluntary savings plans for
eligible salaried and hourly employees. These plans allow participants to make
contributions pursuant to section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Certain
of these plans have Company matching contribution provisions. Charges to
operations were $911 in the five month period ended December 31, 2000 and
$1,731, $1,227, and $953 in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Profit Sharing Plans
DRA sponsors profit sharing plans covering substantially all of its
employees. Distributions are determined based upon formulas established by
management and are made annually. Profit sharing expense for the five month
period ended December 31, 2000 and years ended July 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$728, $2,514, $1,804 and $918, respectively. 8.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Shares issued pursuant to this plan generally vest over three to five years. As
of December 31, 2000, 1,450,400 shares were issued of which 1,383,200 shares
were vested. As of December 31, 2000, 310,800 of these shares had been issued at
a price approximating book value. Unearned compensation was amortized over the
relevant vesting periods. The stockholder notes receivable of $336, $328 and
$322 at December 31, 2000 and July 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, are
associated with the sale of Class A Common Stock and were payable in 2000
through 2002 together with interest at 925% per annum.
40 Initial Public Offering
On December 22, 1997, the Company issued 4,000,000 shares of Class A Common
Stock in an initial public offering at $1200 per share. Also, on January 16,
1998, the Company issued an additional 600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at
$1200 per share as a result of the underwriters' exercise of their
over-allotment option. Net proceeds to the Company from such offerings, after
deduction of associated expense, were approximately $51,336.
Warrants
DRI issued warrants to purchase 1,680,000 shares of DRI Class A Common
Stock at a price of $0012 per share. The warrants were exercisable, in whole or
in part, at any time through June 31, 2004.
Redeemable Exchangeable Preferred Stock of DRA
In connection with the GM Acquisition, DRA issued 15,000 shares of Class A
Preferred Stock par value $01 shares and liquidation preference $1,000 per
share to GM DRA Preferred Stock. The DRA Preferred Stock was exchangeable, at
the option of DRA, in whole or in part, for 8% subordinated debentures to be
issued by DRA at $1,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. As a part
of the December 22, 1997 initial offering and recapitalization, the DRA
Preferred Stock was exchanged for the 8% Subordinated Debenture. As a result, a
deemed dividend of $1,639 on the preferred stock conversion was incurred in
fiscal year 1998.
Dividends
The Company paid no dividends on its common stock. Payment of dividends was
at the discretion of the Company Board of Directors and depended, among other
factors, upon the Company earnings, financial condition and capital
requirements and the terms of the Company financing agreements. The ability of
the Company to make dividend payments was also restricted by the terms of
certain of its debt instruments.
Stock Options
The Company had two fixed stock option plans which reserve shares of common
stock for issuance to executives, key employees, and directors.
In December 1997, the Company adopted the Stock-Based Incentive
Compensation Plan whereby employees of the Company are eligible to be granted
incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. A total of 1,224,000
shares were initially reserved for grants of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, and restricted stock awards under the plan. In December 2000, the
stockholders of the Company approved an increase of 1,224,000 shares, resulting
in a total of 2,448,000 shares authorized as of December 31, 2000.
In December 1997, the Company adopted the Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
for Non-Employee Directors whereby non-employee directors are eligible to be
granted non-qualified stock options. A total of 100,000 shares were initially
reserved for grant under the plan. In December 2000, the stockholders of the
Company approved an increase of 100,000 shares, resulting in an total of 200,000
shares authorized as of December 31, 2000. On December 16, 1997 and December 16,
1999, each non-employee director of the Company was granted options to purchase
2,000 shares.
The exercise price of stock options granted could not be less than the fair
market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options became
exercisable in periods ranging from one to five years and vested ratably over a
period of five years from the date of the grant. Information regarding these
option plans is as follows                    41                                                  Weighted

At December 31, 2000, approximately 227,466 options were exercisable and
approximately 1,605,340 additional shares were available for grant under the
Company plans. No options were exercised during the five months ended
December 31, 2000 and fiscal years 2000, 1999, or 1998.
Disclosure of pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
share is required by FASB Statement No. 123 as if the Company has accounted for
its stock options under the fair value method as defined by that Statement.
Disclosure of this information for the five-month period ended December 31, 2000
has not been provided because these plans were cancelled in March 2001 and the
Company does not believe such disclosure would provide additional meaningful
information to stockholders. The fair value for options granted by the Company
was estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions                                     2000     1999     1998

Expected life of the options years            7       8       8   The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates, in
management opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its stock options.
For purpose of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options are amortized to expense over the related vesting period. Because
compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period, the initial impact
on pro forma net income may not be representative of compensation expense in
future years, when the effect of amortization of multiple awards would be
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company pro forma
information giving effect to the estimated compensation expense related to stock
options is as follows                                      For the Year Ended July 31

2020. The Company also had unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards
of approximately $3,937 that may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company
net operating loss carryforwards expire between 2018 and 2020. Income tax
payments refunds, including state taxes, for the five month period ended

No provision has been made for United States federal and state or foreign
taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries $32,680 at December 31, 2000 because it is expected that
such earnings will be reinvested in these foreign operations indefinitely. It is
not practical to estimate the amount of taxes that might be payable on the
eventual remittances of such earnings.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is party to various legal actions and administrative
proceedings and subject to various claims arising in the ordinary course of
business, including those relating to commercial transactions, product
liability, safety, health, taxes, environmental and other matters. The Company
believes that the ultimate liability, if any, in excess of amounts already
provided for in the financial statements or covered by insurance on the
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 14. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION
The Company is a global vehicular parts designer, manufacturer,
remanufacturer, marketer and distributor, and a provider of core exchange
services. Products include starter motors, alternators, engines, transmissions,
traction control systems, torque converters and fuel systems which are
principally sold or distributed to OEMs for both original equipment manufacture
and aftermarket operations, as well as to warehouse distributors and retail
automotive parts chains. It manages its business and operates in a single
reportable business segment. Because of the similar economic characteristics of
the operations, including the nature of products, production processes,
customers and methods of distribution, those operations have been aggregated
following the provisions of SFAS No. 131 for segment reporting purposes.
45   The Company is a multi-national corporation with operations in many
countries, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Hungary, Poland,
Germany, Korea, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Tunisia and the
Netherlands. As a result, the Company financial results could be significantly
affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak
economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the Company distributes its
products. The Company operating results are exposed to changes in exchange
rates between the U.S. dollar and the Korean Won, the Mexican Peso and various
European currencies. Exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates
is managed primarily through the use of natural hedges, whereby funding
obligations and assets are both denominated in the local currency. From time to
time, the Company enters into exchange agreements to manage its exposure arising
from fluctuating exchange rates related to specific transactions. Sales are
attributed to geographic locations based on the location of product production.                          Five Months Ended     Year Ended July 31

redeemable by the Company prior to April 16, 2021. The Company anticipate that
