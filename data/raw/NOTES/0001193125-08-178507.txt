26  Schmitt Industries, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements For The Years Ended May 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Nature of Operations Schmitt Industries, Inc. the Company designs, assembles, markets and distributes electronic and mechanical components for machine tool products and laser measurement systems worldwide. Principles of Consolidation These consolidated
financial statements include those of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc. SMS and Schmitt Europe, Ltd. SEL. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue for sales and billing for freight charges upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price
with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations, pursuant to the guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue
Recognition, issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2003. For sales to all customers, including manufacturer representatives, distributors or their third-party customers, these criteria are met at the time product is
shipped. When other significant obligations remain after products are delivered, revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled. In addition, judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not
extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectibility is reasonable assured. Cash Equivalents
The Company generally invests excess cash in money market funds and investment grade highly liquid securities. The Company considers
securities that are highly liquid, readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of less than three months when purchased to be cash equivalents. Short-Term Investments At May31, 2008, short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale. The carrying
amount of short-term investments is stated at cost, which approximates fair market value because of their short maturities. There were no related unrealized holding gains or losses at May31, 2008. Accounts Receivable The Company maintains credit
limits for all customers based upon several factors, included but not limited to payment history, published credit reports and use of credit references. Management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded
amounts reflect estimated net realizable value. This review includes accounts receivable agings, other operating trends and relevant business conditions, including general economic factors, as they relate to each of the Company domestic and
international customers. If these analyses lead management to the conclusion that potential significant accounts are uncollectible, a reserve is provided. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $26,584 and $20,818 as of May31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. 
27  Schmitt Industries, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued For The Years Ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 
Inventory Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the average cost basis. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, which are related to the purchase or production of
inventories. As of May31, 2008 and 2007, inventories consisted of:  May31,2008
May31,2007
Raw materials 1,784,580 1,638,256
Work-in-process 722,223 530,415
Finished goods 1,403,628 1,521,692 3,910,431 3,690,363 Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of three to seven years for furniture fixtures, and equipment; three years for vehicles;
and twenty-five years for buildings and improvements. Foreign Currency Translation Financial statements for the Companys subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates for assets
and liabilities and weighted average exchange rates for income and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity titled Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. 
Advertising Advertising costs included in
general, administrative and selling, are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense was $107,539, $112,562 and $82,322 for the fiscal years ended May31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Research and Development Costs Research and
development costs, predominately internal labor costs and costs of materials, are charged to expense when incurred. Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation includes expense charges for all stock-based awards to employees and directors granted under the
Companys stock option plan. On June1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment Revised 2004, which requires the measurement and recognition of
compensation for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors including stock options based on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes previous accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, for periods beginning in Fiscal 2007. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 relating to application of SFAS 123R. The Company has applied the
provisions of SAB 107 in our adoption of SFAS 123R. 
28  Schmitt Industries, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued For The Years Ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 
The Company adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the
application of the accounting standard as of June1, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for periods prior to the first
quarter of Fiscal 2007 have not been restated to reflect this change. Stock-based compensation recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the stock-based award that will vest during the period, adjusted for expected
forfeitures. The compensation cost for awards granted prior to May31, 2006 is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123 while awards granted on or after June1, 2006 follow the
provisions of SFAS 123R to determine the grant date fair value and compensation cost. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is recognized using the straight-line method. Deferred Taxes The Company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes, under
which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined, based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws. Additionally, deferred tax
assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has historically had a valuation allowance against certain foreign net
operating losses as well as domestic capital losses. In Fiscal 2006, management concluded future operations would produce sufficient earnings so that a portion of the asset attributable to foreign net operating losses could be used in future periods
to reduce tax liabilities. In Fiscal 2007, based on current earnings, the remaining valuation allowance related to foreign net operating losses was released. Management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.
There can be no assurance that the Companys future operations will produce sufficient earnings so that the deferred tax asset can be fully utilized. Intangible and Other Long Term Assets Other long term assets include definite-lived intangible assets and a convertible
promissory note. Amortizable intangible assets, purchased technology and patents, are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from eleven to seventeen years. As of May31, 2008, amortizable intangible assets of $3,128,127 net of
accumulated amortization of $327,690 were included in Other Assets. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $215,000 in Fiscal 2009 through 2012 and $181,000 in Fiscal 2013. During Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into a convertible promissory note agreement with Xtero Datacom, Inc. Xtero of Vancouver, British Columbia
pursuant to which the Company will loan up to $250,000 USD to Xtero to fund product development and testing of Xtero satellite measurement technologies. During Fiscal 2008, the maximum amount of the loan was increased to $500,000. The advances under
the loan agreement are based on established milestones being achieved by Xtero in the beta field testing of their technology. The loan is convertible into equity of Xtero at the sole option of Schmitt Industries, Inc. As of May31, 2007, the
Company had advanced $200,000 to Xtero. In the third quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company forgave the outstanding loan payable of $500,000 when the acquisition was completed. This amount was considered as additional consideration. See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Intangible and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the forecasted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate, 
29  Schmitt Industries, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued For The Years Ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 
based on management best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying
value is determined to be in excess of future operating cash flows, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. As of May31, 2008,
management does not believe impairment, as defined above, exists. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for dilutive incremental shares attributed to outstanding options to purchase common stock. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk are
trade accounts receivable. Credit terms generally include a discount of 15% if the invoice is paid within ten days, with the net amount payable in 30 days. Financial Instruments The carrying value of all other financial instruments potentially subject to valuation risk
principally consisting of cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable also approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities. Shipping and Handling Charges The Company incurs
costs related to shipping and handling of its manufactured products. These costs are expensed as incurred as a component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling charges related to the receipt of raw materials are also incurred, which are recorded as
a cost of the related inventory. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recently issued
accounting pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for the fiscal year beginning
June1, 2008. The Companys adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to impact its consolidated financial statements. In February
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115. SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. The provisions of SFAS 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning June1, 2008. The Companys adoption of SFAS 159 is not expected to impact its consolidated financial statements.
30  Schmitt Industries, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued For The Years Ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations
SFAS 141R, which replaces SFAS No 141. SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, and any controlling interest; recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements
to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after May31, 2009. The Company will assess the impact of SFAS 141R if
and when a future acquisition occurs after that date. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2007 and 2006 amounts to conform to 2008 presentations. These reclassifications do not have any impact on
net income or shareholders equity. NOTE 2 LINE OF CREDIT The Company has a $10 million bank line of credit agreement secured by U.S. accounts receivable,
inventories and general intangibles. Interest is payable at the banks prime rate, 50% as of May31, 2008, and the agreement expires on March1, 2009. There were no outstanding balances on the line of credit at May31, 2008 and
2007. NOTE 3 LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 
As of May31, 2008, there were no outstanding obligations under capital leases or purchase contracts. During Fiscal 2004, the Company entered into
an equipment lease, which was treated as a capital lease, and a purchase contract totaling $78,477. One lease expired in Fiscal 2006 and the second expired in Fiscal 2007. Equipment recorded under the capital lease was $48,477, which was fully
depreciated as of May31, 2008. The Company leases certain facilities and equipment to support operations under non-cancelable
operating leases and other contractual obligations. Total rent expense for the years ended May31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $32,370, $64,824 and $41,806, respectively. The approximate future minimum commitments under leases and contractual obligations for each of the years ending May31 are as follows:  YearsendingMay31 2009 38,000

32  Schmitt Industries, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued For The Years Ended May 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the
U.S. statutory federal tax rate to pre-tax income due to the following:  Years ended May31 2008 2007 2006 Statutory federal tax rate

56 Permanent and other differences
29 25 16 Effective tax rate
07 356 243 Adoption of FIN 48 Each year the Company files income tax returns in the various federal, state and local income taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax returns are subject to examination and possible challenge by the
taxing authorities. Positions challenged by the taxing authorities may be settled or appealed by the Company. As a result, there is an uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Companys financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No109. In 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which clarifies the application of SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual income tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprises
financial statements and provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, accounting for interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. On June1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a $34,464 decrease in the Companys liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the June1, 2007 retained earnings balance. At June1, 2007 the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was approximately $490,000, which includes approximately
$150,000 of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Companys effective income tax rate. A reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized income tax benefits is as follows:  Balance at June1, 2007 489,599 Decrease for tax positions taken in prior years payment of tax 38,766 Balance at May31, 2008 450,833 Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of the
Provision for income taxes. The Companys accrual for interest and penalties was $96,500 upon adoption of FIN 48. The liability for payment of interest and penalties increased to $120,000 as of May31, 2008. Several tax years are subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. In the United States, federal tax years for Fiscal 2004 and after are subject to
examination. In the United Kingdom, tax years for Fiscal 2006 and after are subject to examination. In the United States, returns related to an acquired subsidiary for the year ended October31, 1994 and final return for the period ended
May19, 1995 are also subject to examination.

NOTE 5 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In a transaction related to the acquisition of Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc., formerly
TMA Technologies, Inc. TMA, the Company established a royalty pool and vested in each shareholder and debt holder of the acquired company an interest in the royalty pool equal to the amount invested or loaned including interest payable through
March 1995. The royalty pool is funded at 5% of net sales defined as gross sales less returns, allowances and sales commissions of the Companys surface measurement products and future derivative products developed by Schmitt Industries,
Inc., which utilize these technologies. As part of the royalty pool agreement, each former shareholder and debt holder released TMA from any claims with regard to the acquisition except their rights to future royalties. Royalty expense applicable to
the years ended May31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to $47,344, $89,350 and $87,567, respectively. NOTE 6 SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company has two reportable

NOTE 7 STOCK
OPTIONS AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Board of Directors adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan 2004 Plan in August 2004 and the 1995
Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan in December 1995, which plan was amended in August 1996 and restated in August 1998. An option granted under the 2004 Plan and/or 1995 Plan the Plans might be either an incentive stock option ISO, or a nonstatutory
stock option NSO. ISOs may be granted only to employees and members of the Board of Directors of the Company and are subject to certain limitations, in addition to restrictions applicable to all stock options under the Plan. Options not meeting
these limitations will be treated as NSOs. The purchase price of ISOs is fair market value on the date of grant; the purchase price of NSOs may vary from fair market value. Vesting is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors, but is either 50% at grant date and 167% on each anniversary thereafter or 50% at grant date and 25% on each anniversary thereafter. The Company initially reserved 400,000 shares for issuance under the 1995 Plan and 300,000 shares for
issuance under the 2004 Plan. The 1995 Plan expired in December 2005 and no additional options may be issued under the 1995 Plan, although expiration of the 1995 Plan did not affect the rights of persons who received stock grants under the 1995
Plan. Stock-based compensation recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended May31, 2008 and 2007 includes compensation cost for stock-based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of,
May31, 2006. For those awards granted subsequent to June1, 2006, compensation expense has been recognized in accordance with FAS123R. All outstanding options will expire no later than 2015. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company continued to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method of valuation for stock-based awards. The
Companys determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Although the
fair value of stock-based awards is determined in accordance with SFAS 123R and SAB 107, the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results.
These variables include, but are not limited to:  Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent
remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award.  Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The Company determines the
expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and pre-vesting and post-vesting forfeitures.  Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock.
The volatility factor the Company uses is based on its historical stock prices over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the award. These historical periods may exclude portions of time when unusual transactions
occurred.  Expected Dividend Yield. The Company has never paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero.  Expected Forfeitures. The Company uses relevant historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. The Company records stock-based compensation only
for those awards that are expected to vest.

Stock-Based Compensation Under FAS 123R The total stock-based compensation expense recognized for stock based under SFAS 123R was $52,957 and $46,423 during Fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.
All stock-based compensation expense has been recorded as General, administration and sales expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements. At May31, 2008 the Company had a total of 188,484 outstanding stock options 169,734 vested and exercisable and 18,750 non-vested with a weighted average exercise price of $289. The Company estimates that a total of approximately
$56,412 will be recorded as additional stock-based compensation expense over the period beginning with the year ending May31, 2009 through the fiscal year ending May31, 2010, for all options which are outstanding as of May31, 2008,
but which were not yet vested.  Outstanding Options

and $432,232, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended May31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $34,242, $198,207 and $402,122, respectively. Pro Forma Information under SFAS 123 and APB 25 Prior to June1, 2006, the Company elected to
follow the accounting provisions of APB 25 for stock-based compensation and to furnish the pro forma disclosures required under SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. No stock-based
employee compensation cost was reflected in net income because all options granted under the Companys stock option plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant.

NOTE 11 ACQUISITION On February20, 2008, the Company, through its newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Industries Canada Limited, a British Columbia corporation SICL, acquired all of the issued and outstanding common
shares of Xtero Datacom Inc., a British Columbia corporation. As consideration for the Xtero shares, the Company issued 199,977 shares of Company common stock to the Xtero shareholders. In addition, Xtero shareholders will be eligible to receive
shares of SICL stock that are exchangeable for shares of Schmitt common stock on a one-for-one basis based on 50% of the after-tax earnings derived from Xtero products during a five-year earn-out program ending on May31, 2013. The issuance of
the 199,977 shares was not registered, and was made with reliance upon Section3a 10of the Securities Act of 1933 the Act, which exempts judicially approved share exchanges from the Acts registration requirements. On
January29, 2008, the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted a final order approving the transaction. Based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock of $590 on February20, 2008 as reported on the NASDAQ Capital
Market, the aggregate value of the Companys 199,977 shares issued to the Xtero shareholders was approximately $1,179,865. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $1,797,367 which includes the value of shares issued, advances of
$500,000 to Xtero prior to February20, 2008 on a convertible promissory note and other transaction costs.

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the date of acquisition:  Tangible assets and liabilities assumed Receivables 182,000 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 248,657 Deferred tax liabilities 842,280 Intangible assets Purchased technology 2,706,304 1,797,367 The allocation process requires an analysis and valuation of acquired assets, including deferred
tax assets, technologies, customer contracts and relationships, trade names and liabilities assumed, including contractual commitments and legal contingencies. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, total purchase accounting adjustments recorded
were approximately $842,000 arising from deferred tax liabilities with certain assets acquired. In addition during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Canadian subsidiary sold the technology acquired to a US subsidiary resulting in net tax
benefits related to a gain exclusion provision in Canada of $211,000, which reduced the Companys effective tax rate. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based on information available as of
May31, 2008, and may be adjusted as further information becomes available. Additional information that may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and liabilities includes, but is not
limited to, unidentified claims from suppliers or other contingent obligations, the amounts required to settle them, and the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any changes in the values allocated to tangible and specifically identified
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period may result in adjustments to intangible assets. Purchased
technology relates to Xteros remote satellite sensing of large chemical storage tanks that have reached technological feasibility. The fair value of the purchased technology is being amortized over the expected remaining useful life of 15
years. NOTE 12 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

42  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders Schmitt Industries, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Schmitt Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of May31, 2008 and 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May31, 2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Schmitt Industries, Inc. as of May31, 2008 and 2007 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended May31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As discussed in
Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment Revised 2004,
effective June1, 2006. As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for uncertain tax positions as a result of adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109, effective June1, 2007.

Unresolved Staff Comments None.  Item2.
Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation and the material
weakness described below, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f or 15d-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlsIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of May31, 2008 as a result of material weakness in internal
controls as described below. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or
interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management determined the controls around the review of
significant non-routine transactions did not operate effectively, resulting in audit adjustments to the Fiscal 2008 consolidated financial statements. These deficiencies, if left unremediated, could result in the failure to prevent or detect a
material misstatement in the Companys consolidated financial statements. This annual report does not include an attestation report
of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules
of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report in the annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f that occurred during the quarter ended May31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
