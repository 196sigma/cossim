PetMed Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of PetMed Express, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as
of March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2007. These consolidated financial statements are
the  responsibility of the Company management.  Our
responsibility  is  to express an  opinion  on  these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
audit  includes examining, on a test basis,  evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles  used  and significant  estimates  made  by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of PetMed Express, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended March 31, 2007, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed the manner in which it
accounts for share-based compensation effective April 1,
2006.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States, the effectiveness of the Company internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based on
criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated
Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our
report dated May 31, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. s/ Goldstein Golub Kessler LLP

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
PetMed Express, Inc. and subsidiaries, d/b/a 1-800-
PetMeds, the Company is a leading nationwide pet
pharmacy.  The Company markets and sells prescription
and non-prescription pet medications and other health
products for dogs, cats, and horses direct to the
consumer.
The Company markets its products through national
television, online and direct mail/print advertising
campaigns, which aim to increase the recognition of the
1-800-PetMeds brand name, increase traffic on its
website at www1800petmeds.com, acquire new customers,
and maximize repeat purchases. The majority of all of
the Company sales are to residents in the United
States. The Company executive offices are located in
Pompano Beach, Florida. The Company fiscal year end
is March 31. References herein to fiscal 2007, 2006,
or 2005 refer to the Company fiscal years ended March
31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Principles of Consolidation
The  consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its two wholly owned
subsidiaries.   All   significant   intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue by selling pet medication
products primarily to retail consumers and minimally to
wholesale customers.  The Company policy is  to
recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment,
when the rights of ownership and risk of loss have
passed to the consumer. Outbound shipping and handling
fees  are included in sales and are billed upon
shipment.  Shipping expenses are included in cost of
sales.
The majority of the Company sales are paid by credit
cards and the Company usually receives the  cash
settlement in two to three banking days. Credit card
sales  minimize  the accounts receivable  balances
relative to sales. The Company maintains an allowance
for doubtful accounts for losses that the Company
estimates will arise from the customers' inability to
make required payments, arising from either credit card
charge-backs or insufficient funds checks. The Company
determines its estimates of the uncollectibility of
accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts
and current economic trends. At March 31, 2007 and
2006,  the  allowance for doubtful  accounts  was
approximately $28,000 and $23,000, respectively.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents at
March 31, 2007 and 2006, consisted of the Company
cash accounts, overnight repurchase agreements, and
short-term investments with a maturity of three months
or less.  The carrying amount of cash equivalents
approximates fair value. The Company maintains its
cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may
exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not
experienced any losses in such accounts.
Temporary Investments
The  Company  has reclassified its  auction  rate
securities ARS from cash and cash equivalents to
temporary  investments on its  balance  sheet  in
accordance with recent accounting pronouncements. This
reclassification affected both the balance sheet in
fiscal 2006 and 2007 and cash flow statement in fiscal
2005, 2006, and 2007, it did not affect net income or
working capital in fiscal 2005, 2006, or 2007.  In
accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No.
108,  Considering  the  Effects  of  Prior  Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements, no changes to financial
statements issued in prior years were deemed necessary.
In  accordance  with the Statement  of  Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,
temporary investments are accounted for as trading
securities. Trading securities are securities that are
bought and held principally for the purpose of selling
in the near term. The Company has not changed its
investment  policy.  The  Company  believes  that
notwithstanding the reclassification, the investments
in ARS are: short term and highly liquid, readily
convertible to known amounts of cash, and present an
insignificant risk of change in value due to market
changes in interest rates.                  28      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued   Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the consolidated financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Inventories
Inventories  consist  of  prescription  and  non-
prescription pet medications and pet supplies that are
available for sale and are priced at the lower of cost
or market value using a weighted average cost method.
The Company writes down its inventory for estimated
obsolescence.  The inventory reserve was approximately
$122,000 and $306,000 at March 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
Property and Equipment
Property  and equipment are stated at  cost  and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. The furniture,
fixtures,  equipment,  and computer  software  are
depreciated over periods ranging from three to seven
years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital
lease agreements are amortized over the shorter of the
underlying lease agreement or the useful life of the
asset.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying
amount of the asset to net future cash flows expected
to be generated from the asset.
Intangible Asset
The intangible asset consists of a toll-free telephone
number. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, the intangible asset is not
being amortized, and is subject to an annual review for
impairment.
Advertising
The Company advertising expenses consists primarily
of television advertising, internet marketing, and
direct mail/print advertising. Television costs are
expensed as the advertisements are televised. Internet
costs are expensed in the month incurred and direct
mail/print advertising costs are expensed when the
related  catalog  and  postcards  are  produced,
distributed, or superseded.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company cash and cash
equivalents, temporary investments, accounts receivable,
and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the
short-term nature of these instruments.
Comprehensive Income
The  Company  applies  SFAS  No.  130,  Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which requires that all items
that are recognized under accounting standards as
components of comprehensive income be reported in a
financial statement that is displayed with the same
prominence as other financial statements. The items of
other comprehensive income that are typically required

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Income Taxes
The  Company accounts for income taxes under the
provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which generally requires recognition of deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
benefits or consequences of events that have been
included in the consolidated financial statements or
tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between
the financial reporting carrying values and the tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by
applying enacted tax rates and laws for the taxable
years in which those differences are expected to
reverse.
Accounting for Share Based Compensation
Stock Options
Effective April 1, 2006, the Company began recording
compensation expense associated with stock options in
accordance with SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment,
which is a revision of SFAS No. 123. Prior to April 1,
2006,  the  Company  accounted  for  stock-based
compensation related to stock options  under  the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. At that time the
Company measured compensation expense for its stock
option plans using the intrinsic value method, that is,
as the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the
Company stock at the grant date over the amount
required to be paid to acquire the stock, and provided
the disclosures required by SFAS Nos. 123 and 148. The
Company has adopted the modified prospective transition
method provided under SFAS No. 123R, and as a result,
has not retroactively adjusted results from prior
periods.  Under this transition method, compensation
expense associated with stock options recognized in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2007, and in subsequent
quarters, includes: 1 expense related to the remaining
unvested portion of all stock option awards granted
prior to April 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value  estimated in accordance with the  original
provisions of SFAS No. 123; and 2 expense related to
all  stock  option awards granted,  or  modified,
subsequent to April 1, 2006, based on the grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 123R.
As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the
Company net income for the year ended March 31, 2007
includes  $893,000 of compensation  expense.  The
compensation expense related to all of the Company
stock-based compensation arrangements is recorded as a
component of general and administrative expenses.
For stock options granted prior to April 1, 2006, the
estimated fair value of each option award granted was
determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model. For stock option grants on and
after April 1, 2006, the estimated fair value of each
option award granted will be determined on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a
lattice-based option valuation model. The per share
weighted-average fair value of stock options granted
during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was $351 and $545,
respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-
Scholes option-pricing model, as prescribed by SFAS No.
123, with the following weighted-average assumptions:
no dividend yield; risk-free interest rates ranging
from 4 to 6 percent; expected lives of 3-5 years, and
expected volatility of 66 percent and 86 percent,
respectively. The risk-free interest rates for fiscal
2006 and 2005 were based on the prime interest rate at
the date of grant. The expected volatility was based
on the historical volatility of the Company stock.
No assumptions were necessary for fiscal 2007, due to
the fact that no stock options were granted during the
year.                  30      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Restricted Stock
On July 28, 2006, the Company received shareholder
approval for the adoption of the 2006 Employee Equity
Compensation Restricted Stock Plan the  Employee
Plan  and  the  2006  Outside  Director  Equity
Compensation Restricted Stock Plan the  Director
Plan.  The purpose of the plans is to promote the
interests of the Company by securing and retaining both
employees and outside directors.  The Company has
reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance
under the Employee Plan. The Company has reserved
200,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the
Director Plan. The value of the restricted stock is
determined based on the market value of the common
stock at the issuance date. The restriction period or
forfeiture period is determined by the Company Board,
to be no less than 1 year and no more than ten years.
The Company had 136,625 restricted common shares issued
under the Employee Plan and 20,000 restricted common
shares issued under the Director Plan at March 31,
2007, the fair value of which is being amortized over a
three-year period. For the year ended March 31, 2007
the Company recognized $203,000 of compensation expense
related to the Employee and Director Plans.  The
compensation expense related to all of the Company
stock-based compensation arrangements is recorded as a
component of general and administrative expenses.  At
March 31, 2007, there was $1,668,000 of unrecognized
compensation cost related to the non-vested restricted
stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over
the remaining weighted average vesting period of 270
years.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109 FIN 48, which provides
criteria   for  the  recognition,  measurement,
presentation,  and  disclosure  of  uncertain  tax
positions.  A tax benefit from an uncertain position
may be recognized only if it is more likely than not
that the position is sustainable based on its technical
merits.  The provisions of FIN 48 were effective for
the Company fiscal year beginning April 1, 2007.  We
do not expect FIN 48 will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.                  31      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued   In June 2006, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 06-3, How
Taxes  Collected from Customers and  Remitted  to
Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the
Income  Statement  That  Is,  Gross  versus  Net
Presentation. The scope of EITF 06-3 includes sales,
use, value added, and some excise taxes that are
assessed  by a governmental authority on specific
revenue-producing transactions between a seller and
customer. EITF 06-3 requires disclosure of the method
of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the
amount of assessed taxes that are included in revenues
if they are accounted for under the gross method. EITF
06-3  is effective for the Company fiscal year
beginning April 1, 2007. EITF 06-3 will not impact the
method for recording these taxes in the Company
consolidated financial statements as  the  Company
historically has presented sales excluding these taxes.
In  September  2006, the Securities and  Exchange
Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current
Year Financial Statements. SAB 108 provides guidance
on the consideration of effects of the prior year
misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements
for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The SEC
staff believes registrants must quantify errors using
both a balance sheet and income statement approach and
evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying
a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered, is material.  SAB
108 is effective for the first annual period ending
after  November  15, 2006 with early  application
encouraged. The Company adopted SAB 108 in fiscal 2007.
The Company does not believe that any other recently
issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if
currently adopted, will have a material effect on the
Company consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

5 Shareholders' Equity
Preferred Stock
In April 1998, the Company issued 250,000 shares of its
$001 par value preferred stock at a price of $400 per
share, less issuance costs of $112,187. Each share of
the preferred stock is convertible into approximately
405 shares of common stock at the election of the
shareholder.  The shares have a liquidation value of
$400 per share and may pay dividends at the sole
discretion of the Company.  The Company does not
anticipate  paying  dividends  to  the  preferred
shareholders in the foreseeable future. Each share of
preferred stock is entitled to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of shareholders of the Company. As
of March 31, 2007 and 2006, 2,500 shares of the
convertible preferred stock remained unconverted and
outstanding.
6 Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
temporary differences between the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The tax
effects of temporary differences that give rise to

8 Net Income Per Share
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share, basic net income per share is
computed by dividing net income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net
income per common share includes the dilutive effect of
potential stock options exercised and the effects of
the  potential  conversion  of  preferred  shares,
calculated  using  the  treasury  stock  method.
Outstanding stock options and convertible preferred
shares issued by the Company represent the  only
dilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted average
shares outstanding. The following is a reconciliation
of the numerators and denominators of the basic and
diluted net income per share computations for the
periods presented                              Year Ended March 31,

Diluted                  $    060 $    050 $    034
At March 31, 2007 and 2006, all common stock options
were included in the diluted net income per common
share computation as their exercise prices were less
than the average market price of the common shares for
the period.  At March 31, 2005, 485,500 common stock
options, with a weighted average exercise price of
$969, were excluded from the diluted net income per
share computation as their exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of the common shares for
the period, therefore the effect would have been anti-
dilutive.

Legal Matters
On January 19, 2006, PetMed Express, Inc. was added as
a defendant in the matter of Yali Golan v. Marc Puleo
former  President and Chairman of the Board  of
Directors of the Company, filed in the Circuit Court
of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade
County, Florida. On March 6, 2006, the Company filed a
motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint against
the Company and on March 30, 2007, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Florida
granted the Company motion to dismiss  in  its
entirety.
The Company was a defendant in a multi-defendant
lawsuit, filed in August 2006 in the United States
District Court For The Eastern District of Texas,
Marshall Division, seeking injunctive and monetary
relief styled Ronald A. Katz Technology Licensing,
L.P., v. Aetna Inc. et al., Cause No. 206CV 335.  The
lawsuit alleged that the Company was infringing on
certain telephone call manipulation technology-related
patents owned by the plaintiff. Without admitting any
liability or wrongdoing, and with no finding  or
admission as to the merit or lack of merit of any claim
or defense asserted in connection with the litigation,
in January, 2007, the Company entered into a licensing
agreement for a confidential amount, and a Stipulation
of Dismissal with Prejudice was filed with the Court,
dismissing the lawsuit against the Company.
Routine Proceedings
The Company is a party to routine litigation and
administrative complaints incidental to its business.
Management does not believe that the resolution of any
or all of such routine litigation and administrative
complaints is likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Company financial condition or results of
operations.  The Company has settled complaints that
had been filed with various states' pharmacy boards in
the past. There can be no assurances made that other
states will not attempt to take similar actions against
the Company in the future. Legal costs related to the

and integrity of the Consolidated Financial Statements
appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial
statements were prepared in conformity with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  appropriate  in  the
circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts
based on our best judgments and estimates.  Financial
information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent
with that in the financial statements.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act.  The
Company internal control over financial reporting is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our internal control
over  financial reporting is supported by a team  of
consultants and appropriate reviews by management, written
policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of
qualified personnel, and a written Corporate Code  of
Business Conduct and Ethics adopted by our Company Board
of Directors, applicable to all Company Directors and all
officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements
and even when determined to be effective, can only provide
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Audit Committee Committee of our Company Board of
Directors, comprised solely of Directors who are independent
in accordance with the requirements of The NASDAQ Stock
Market LLC listing standards, the Exchange Act and the
Company Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the
independent auditors and management periodically to discuss
internal control over financial reporting, and auditing and
financial reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the
independent auditors the scope and results of the audit
effort.  The Committee also meets periodically with the
independent auditors without management present to ensure
that the independent auditors have free access to the
Committee. Our Audit Committee Report can be found in the
Company 2007 Proxy Statement.
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2007.  In making this assessment, management used the
criteria  set  forth by the Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment,
management believes that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31,
2007.

LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by
the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors,
subject to ratification by our Company shareholders.

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders
PetMed Express, Inc. We have audited management assessment, included in the
accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting, that PetMed Express, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
PetMed  Express, Inc. management is responsible  for
maintaining  effective internal control over  financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining  an  understanding of internal control  over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment,
testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the  company;  2 provide reasonable  assurance  that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of  financial statements in accordance with  generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and
expenditures of the company are being made  only  in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of  the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets
that  could have a material effect on the  financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over  financial reporting may not prevent  or  detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation  of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes  in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In  our opinion, management assessment that PetMed
Express, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2007 is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the  Treadway
Commission COSO. Also in our opinion, PetMed Express, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2007, based
on  criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of
the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States,  the  March  31, 2007 consolidated  financial
statements of PetMed Express, Inc. and our report dated May
31, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements. s/ Goldstein Golub Kessler LLP
