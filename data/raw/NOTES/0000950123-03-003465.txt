INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Steel Dynamics, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steel Dynamics,
Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Steel Dynamics,
Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements in 2001 the company changed
its method of accounting for derivative financial instruments. s/ Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Steel Dynamics, Inc. SDI, together with its subsidiaries the
company, is a domestic manufacturer of steel products with operations in the
following businesses.
Steel Operations. Steel operations include the Flat Roll Division, the
Structural and Rail Division and the forthcoming Bar Division. The Flat Roll
Division is currently the company core business and operates a technologically
advanced flat-roll steel mini-mill located in Butler, Indiana, with an annual
production capacity of 22 million tons of flat-rolled carbon steel products,
including hot-rolled, cold-rolled and coated steel products. During 2002, the
facility produced 24 million tons, or approximately 200,000 tons in excess of
its previously estimated annual capacity to meet market demand. The company
sells these products directly to end-users, intermediate steel processors and
service centers located primarily in the Midwestern United States. These
products are used in numerous industry sectors, including automotive,
construction and commercial industries.
The company began construction of its Structural and Rail Division, located in
Columbia City, Indiana, in May 2001, and commenced commercial structural steel
operations during the third quarter of 2002. The mini-mill is designed to have
an annual production capacity of up to 13 million tons of structural steel
beams, pilings, and other steel components, as well as standard and
premium-grade rails. Through regular product introductions and continued
production ramp-up of structural steel products, the company anticipates being
able to offer a full complement of wide-flange beam and H-piling structural
steel products during the first quarter of 2003. In addition, the company
expects to begin production of standard rail products during the second quarter
of 2003. The initial rail production will be used in a testing capacity to be
monitored by individual railroad companies for qualification purposes. This
qualification process may take between six and nine months for completion. The
company generally sells its structural products directly to end-users and steel
service centers to be used primarily in the construction, transportation and
industrial machinery markets.
On September 9, 2002, the company purchased the special bar quality mini-mill
assets of Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC, located in Pittsboro, Indiana for $45
million. The company plans to invest between $70 and $75 million of additional
capital to convert the facility to the production of merchant bars and shapes
and reinforcing bar products, with an anticipated annual production capacity of
between 500,000 and 600,000 tons. The company estimates initial production will
commence during the first quarter of 2004 and plans to market the bar products
directly to end-users and to service centers for the construction,
transportation and industrial machinery markets.
Steel Scrap Substitute and Other Operations. The company wholly owned
subsidiary, Iron Dynamics, Inc. IDI, located in Butler, Indiana, involves the
pioneering of a process to produce direct reduced iron, which is then converted
into liquid pig iron. Liquid pig iron is a high quality steel scrap substitute
used in the company flat-roll steel mini-mill. During 1999, IDI commenced
initial start-up and produced and sold a minimal amount of liquid pig iron to
the company Flat Roll Division; however, it was determined that IDI would
require certain design and equipment modifications to attain its fully intended
operating functionality. These modifications occurred during the second half of
2000 with completion and restart occurring in the first quarter of 2001. While
IDI believed that many of the design and equipment deficiencies were corrected
with these modifications, the company halted operations at IDI during July 2001
with no specific date set for resumption of actual production, as a result of
higher-than-expected start-up and process refinement costs, lower-than-expected
production quantities, exceptionally high energy costs and historically low
steel scrap pricing. From the time operations were halted in 2001 up until the
fourth quarter of 2002, the costs incurred at IDI were composed of those
expenses required to maintain the facility and further evaluate the project and
its related benefits. On July 10, 2002, IDI announced that it would begin
experimental production trials in the fourth quarter of 2002. These trials
utilized a modified production process. IDI successfully completed certain
operating trials which may significantly reduce the eventual per-unit cost of
liquid pig iron production. On February 24, 2003, the company announced its
intent to restart IDI in the second half of 2003. The company board of
directors approved an additional capital investment of approximately $14 million
for additional modifications and refinements required to implement this modified
production process at the IDI facility. These modifications are expected to be
completed during 2003. The company also has two consolidated subsidiary
operations: one that receives revenue from the fabrication of trusses, girders,
steel joists and steel decking for the non-residential construction industry and
one that receives revenue from the further processing, or slitting, and sale of
certain secondary and excess steel products.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of SDI, together with its subsidiaries, including New Millennium
Building Systems LLC NMBS, after elimination of significant intercompany
accounts and transactions. Minority interest represents the minority
shareholders' proportionate share in the equity or income of the company
consolidated subsidiaries.                    50
STEEL DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Use of Estimates. The financial statements are prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and, accordingly,
include amounts that are based on management estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and in the notes
thereto. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition. The company generally recognizes revenues from sales and
the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when
the title of the product transfers. Provision is made for estimated product
returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience.
Freight Costs. The company reflects freight costs associated with shipping its
products to customers as a component of cost of goods sold.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition.
Restricted cash is held by trustees in debt service funds for the repayment of
principal and interest related to the company municipal bonds.
Marketable Securities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, the company has classified its marketable securities as `available
for sale and, accordingly, carries such securities at aggregate fair value.
Unrealized gains or losses are included in other accumulated comprehensive loss
as a component of stockholders' equity.
Inventories. Inventories are stated at lower of cost principally standard cost
which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
Inventory consisted of the following at December 31 in thousands                        2002    2001
Raw materials..     $ 53,532  $ 44,807

Finished goods..      32,022   22,791
$153,204  $118,368
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost,
which includes capitalized interest on construction-in-progress and is reduced
by proceeds received from certain state and local government grants and other
capital cost reimbursements. The company assigns each fixed asset a useful life
ranging from five to 12 years for plant, machinery and equipment and 20 to 30
years for buildings and improvements. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation for non-production assets is provided utilizing the
straight-line depreciation methodology. Depreciation for production assets is
provided utilizing the units-of-production depreciation methodology, based on
units produced, subject to a minimum and maximum level. Depreciation expense was
$564 million, $459 million and $447 million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
No. 144 FAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, which supersedes FASB Statement No. 121 FAS 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,
and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 30 APB 30, Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business and Extraordinary Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. FAS 144 retains the fundamental
provisions of FAS 121 for recognition and measurement of the impairment of
long-lived assets to be held and used, and measurement of long-lived assets to
be disposed of by sale. FAS 144 broadens the presentation requirements of
discontinued operations of APB 30 to include a component of an entity rather
than a segment of business. In accordance with the methodology described in FAS
144, the company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in
operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash
flows estimated to be generated during the life of those assets are less than
the assets' carrying amounts. The impairment loss is measured by comparing the
fair value of the asset to its carrying amount.
At December 31, 2002, events and circumstances indicated that approximately
$1170 million of assets related to Iron Dynamics might be impaired. However,
the company estimate of undiscounted cash flows was approximately $856
million in excess of such carrying amounts and therefore, in compliance with FAS
144, no charge was recorded. The company made various assumptions in estimating
the undiscounted cash flows, including, among other things, a weighted average
of the most likely achieved production levels, significant cost components,
required capital expenditures and the date for resumption of commercial
production.                    51
STEEL DYNAMICS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Nonetheless, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash
flows may change in the near term, resulting in the need to write-down those
assets to fair value.
Other Accumulated Comprehensive Loss. The following table presents the company
components of other accumulated comprehensive loss at December 31 in

Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the
company to significant concentrations of credit risk principally consist of
temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The company places its
temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions and
limits the amount of credit exposure from any one institution. Generally, the
company does not require collateral or other security to support customer
receivables.
Earnings Per Share. The company computes and presents earnings per common share
in accordance with FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings
per share is based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes, in addition to the above,
the weighted average dilutive effect of common share equivalents outstanding
during the period. Common share equivalents represent dilutive stock options and
dilutive convertible subordinated debt and are excluded from the computation in
periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. The difference between the
company basic and diluted earnings per share is solely attributable to stock
options. The following table represents the common share equivalents that were
excluded from the company dilutive earnings per share calculation because they
were anti-dilutive at December 31 in thousands                               2002  2001  2000

Derivative Financial Instruments. Effective January 1, 2001, the company adopted
FASB Statement No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instrument and
Hedging Activities, as amended. FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. It requires
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial condition and measure those instruments at fair value.
Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as
hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, are recognized as either an offset
against the change in fair value of the hedged balance sheet item through
earnings or as other comprehensive income, until the hedged item is recognized
in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is
immediately recognized in earnings. On an annual basis, there has been no hedge
ineffectiveness recorded since adoption of FAS 133.
In the normal course of business, the company has limited involvement with
derivative financial instruments in an effort to manage the company exposure
to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates. The company employs
interest rate swap agreements, which are accounted for as cash flow hedges, and
periodically employs foreign currency exchange contracts as necessary. Upon
adoption of FAS 133, the company designated and assigned its financial
instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities or anticipated
transactions. When hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished, or the
anticipated transaction being hedged is no longer expected to occur, the company
recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedged financial instrument. The
company classified its derivative financial instruments as held or issued for
purposes other than trading. The company results of operations and financial
position reflect the impact of adopting FAS 133 commencing January 1, 2001, as a
one-time after-tax cumulative effect of an accounting change of approximately
$25 million as a reduction in other comprehensive income.
Stock-Based Compensation. In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 148
FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure,
which amends FASB Statement No. 123 FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. FAS 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2002, and gives further guidance regarding methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and regarding disclosure requirements as previously defined in FAS
123. At December 31, 2002, the company had three incentive stock option plans,
which are described more fully in Note 6, and accounted for these plans under
the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. Under APB 25, no                    52

stock-based employee compensation cost related to the incentive stock option
plans is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had
an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant.

fair value of the individual options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
$707, $517 and $419, respectively, on the date of grant. The fair values at
the date of grant were estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following assumptions: no-dividend-yield, risk-free interest rates from
32% to 71%, expected volatility from 30% to 62% and expected lives from five
months to eight years.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement No.
145 FAS 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. This statement, among other
things, rescinds FAS 4, which required all gains and losses from extinguishment
of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item,
net of the related income tax effect. The company intends to adopt FAS 145 as of
January 1, 2003, as required. Upon adoption, any gain or loss on extinguishment
of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented
that does not meet the criteria in APB 30 for classification as an extraordinary
item, will be reclassified as income or loss from continuing operations. The
company has determined that the adoption of FAS 145 will not have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements. The loss on extinguishment of
debt recorded in 2002 of $35 million, net of related tax of $21 million, will
no longer be classified as an extraordinary item in the company 2003 financial
statements; rather, it will be included in the company income from operations.
In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement No. 146 FAS 146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The statement requires companies
to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are
incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan.
Costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain
employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, plant
closing, or other exit or disposal activity. FAS 146 is effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. FAS 146 may affect the
timing of the company recognition of future exit or disposal costs, if any.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires a company, at the time it
issues certain guarantees, to recognize an initial liability for the fair value
of the obligations assumed under the guarantee. FIN 45 also provides guidance
concerning existing disclosure requirements related to guarantees and
warranties. The initial recognition requirements of FIN 45 are effective for
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, and adoption of the
disclosure requirements are effective for the company as of December 31, 2002.
The company believes the adoption of FIN 45 will not have a material impact on
its consolidated financial statements.                    53

NOTE 3. DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM CONTINGENT LIABILITY
SDI Refinancing. On March 26, 2002, the company refinanced its existing $4500
million senior secured credit facility and its $45 million senior unsecured
credit facility with the following -   $750 million in the form of a five-year revolving credit facility,
maturing March 26, 2007, which is subject to a borrowing base and bears
interest at floating rates -   $700 million in the form of a five-year term A loan, payable in quarterly
installments beginning June 26, 2003, with the final installment due March
26, 2007, and bearing interest at floating rates -   $2050 million in the form of a six-year term B loan, payable in quarterly

The new $3500 million senior secured credit facility is secured by liens and
mortgages on substantially all of the personal and real property assets of the
company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and by pledges of all shares of
capital stock and inter-company debt held by the company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. The new senior secured credit facility contains financial
covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict the company with respect to
its ability to make capital expenditures, incur indebtedness, and make
restricted payments or investments, among other things.
The $2000 million 95% senior unsecured notes have a maturity of seven years.
The company may redeem the notes at any time on or after March 15, 2006, at a
redemption price of 104750%; on or after March 15, 2007, at a redemption price
of 102275%; and on or thereafter March 15, 2008, at a redemption price of
100000%. In addition, at any time prior to March 15, 2005, the company may
redeem up to 35% of the principal amount of the notes with the net cash proceeds
of its common stock at a redemption price of 109500% plus accrued interest up
to the redemption date, provided that certain other restrictions as described in
the indenture are met. The notes bear interest at 95%, payable semiannually on
each March 15th and September 15th, commencing September 15, 2002.
On December 17, 2002, the company refinanced $960 million of its $3500 million
senior secured credit facility with $1000 million of 40% convertible
subordinated notes due December 15, 2012. The net proceeds of the offering were
$960 million after payment of the underwriting fees and expenses of the
offering, which will be amortized over the term of the notes. The notes are
non-callable for five years and bear interest at 40%, payable semiannually on
each June 15th and December 15th, commencing June 15, 2003. In addition, the
company will pay contingent interest during any six-month period commencing
December 15, 2007, if the trading price of the notes for each of the five
trading days immediately preceding such period equals or exceeds 120% of the
principal amount of the notes. Holders may convert the notes into shares of the
company common stock at a conversion rate of 588076 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment, before close of business on
December 15, 2012, only under the following circumstances: 1 at any time after
the closing sale price of the company common stock exceeds 120% of the
conversion price, or $2041 per share, for at least 20 trading days in the 30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of any fiscal quarter
commencing after December 31, 2002; 2 upon the occurrence of specified credit
rating events with respect to the notes; 3 if the notes have been called for

100000%. During January 2003, the original purchasers of the company 40%
convertible subordinated notes exercised their right to purchase an additional
$150 million aggregate principal, thereby increasing the issue to $1150
million. The company used the additional $140 million in net proceeds to
further prepay its $3500 million senior secured credit facility. During 2002
the company recorded an extraordinary loss of $35 million, net of related tax
benefit of $21 million, related to accelerated amortization of deferred
financing costs due to the above refinancings.
IDI Settlement. On January 28, 2002, the company entered into an agreement with
the Iron Dynamics' lenders to extinguish the debt under the IDI senior secured
credit agreement at the end of March 2002. The company complied with each of the
settlement requirements, thus constituting full and final settlement of all of
Iron Dynamics' obligations and the Steel Dynamics' guarantees under the Iron
Dynamics credit agreement. In meeting the requirements of the settlement
agreement, the company paid $150 million in cash and issued an aggregate of
$220 million, or 15 million shares, of the company common stock during March
2002. In addition, if Iron Dynamics resumes operations by January 27, 2007, and
generates positive cash flow as defined in the settlement agreement, the
company is required to make contingent future payments in an aggregate not to
exceed $220 million. The contingent future payments are non-interest bearing
and have been classified as non-current, as no payments are expected to be
required during 2003.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
facilities located at the Butler, Indiana, mini-mill. As of December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively, approximately $26 million and $30 million of the bond
proceeds were held by the bond trustee in a debt-service reserve fund and were
recorded as restricted cash. In August 2002, the stand-by letter of credit
relating to the municipal bonds was drawn in the amount of $153 million by the
Indiana Development Finance Authority. In turn, the lenders that provided the
stand-by letter of credit entered into a five-year term loan agreement with the
company for the drawn amount. This term facility bears interest at floating
rates and had a weighted-average interest rate of 41% as of December 31, 2002.
In November 1998, the company received $100 million from Whitley County,
Indiana, representing proceeds from solid waste and sewage disposal revenue
bonds to be used to finance certain solid waste and sewage disposal facilities
located at the Whitley County, Indiana, structural and rail mill. The bonds bear
interest at 73%, with interest payable semi-annually and principal payments
commencing November 2003 through final maturity in November 2018.
Electric Utility Development Loans. In June 1994, the company entered into a
loan agreement for approximately $130 million to finance the company portion
of the cost to construct an electric substation. The loan bears interest at
80%, with equal monthly principal and interest payments required in amounts
sufficient to amortize the substation facility loan over a period of 15 years.
The outstanding principal balance on the substation facility loan was $94
million and $102 million, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
In addition, the company entered into a loan agreement for approximately $78
million to finance the company portion of the cost to construct an electric
transmission line and certain related facilities. The loan bears interest at
80%, with equal monthly principal and interest payments required in amounts
sufficient to amortize the transmission facility loan over a period of 20 years.
The outstanding principal balance on the transmission facility loan was $63
million and $66 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During 1998, IDI entered into an agreement with an electric utility to provide a
$65 million eight-year loan. This loan is secured by on-site power distribution
and related equipment. The related interest rate is tied to 90-day commercial
paper rates with an option to establish a fixed interest rate based on an
average of the interest rates applicable to one, three and five year U.S.
Treasuries. The weighted-average interest rate was 34% and 51% as of December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The outstanding principal balance on the

structural and rail division. This funding was provided in April 2002. The loan
bears interest at 81%, with monthly principal and interest payments required in
amounts sufficient to amortize the transmission facility loan over a period of
20 years, with the unpaid principal due at the end of 10 years. The company also
has an undrawn $15 million outstanding stand-by letter of credit associated
with the REMC agreement. The outstanding principal balance on the transmission
facility loan was $96 million as of December 31, 2002.

utilized its remaining net operating loss carryforwards for federal purposes. As
of December 31, 2002, the company had available capital loss carryforwards of
approximately $52 million for federal and state income tax purposes, which
expire beginning in 2005. As of December 31, 2002, the company had available
foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $30 million for federal
income tax purposes, which expire in 2003. Due to the limited time frame
remaining to utilize the foreign tax credits and the decreased likelihood that
the net operating losses will be fully absorbed prior to the expiration of the
credits, a valuation allowance of $19 million was recorded in 2001. Even if
these credits are not utilized as such, they can be treated as tax-deductible
expenses. Therefore, $11 million of foreign tax credit remains as a deferred
tax asset as of December 31, 2002.                    57

Officer and Manager Cash and Stock Bonus Plan. Officers and managers of the
company are eligible to receive cash bonuses based on predetermined formulas
designated in the Officer and Manager Cash and Stock Bonus Plan. In the event
the cash portion of the bonus exceeds the predetermined maximum cash payout, the
excess bonus is distributed as common stock of the company. Any common stock
issued pursuant to this plan vests one-third in January of each of the three
years following the year of award. A total of 450,000 shares have been reserved
under this plan. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 27,000 shares of the
original 82,000 shares related to the 2000 stock bonus award, and 144,000 shares
related to the 2002 stock bonus award remained committed for issuance.
NOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The company has an off-take agreement with Heidtman Steel Products Heidtman
that extends through March 2007 see Note 8. Under the terms of the agreement,
Heidtman is obligated to purchase, and the company is obligated to sell to
Heidtman, at least 76,000 tons of hot-band products per quarter, or 336,000 tons
annually, and at least 15,000 tons of cold-rolled products per quarter, or
60,000 tons annually. For hot-rolled steel, the company pricing to Heidtman is
determined by either a market pricing formula based on an all-in cost-plus
basis or a spot market pricing formula determined on the basis of a discounted
market index. For cold-rolled products, the pricing is determined on a marginal
revenue basis over hot-rolled sheet.
The company has executed a raw material supply contract with OmniSource
Corporation OmniSource for the purchase of steel scrap resources see Note 8.
Under the terms of the contract, OmniSource has agreed to act as the company
exclusive scrap purchaser and to use its best efforts to locate and secure up to
a minimum of 80% of the company steel scrap requirements, at the lowest
then-available market prices for material of like grade, quantity and delivery
dates. The cost to the company of OmniSource-owned scrap is the prices at which
OmniSource, in bona fide market transactions, can actually sell material of like
grade, quality and quantity. With respect to general market brokered scrap, the
cost to the company is the price at which OmniSource can actually purchase that
scrap in the market, without mark-up or any other additional cost. For its
brokering services, OmniSource receives a commission per gross ton of scrap
received by the company. All final decisions regarding scrap purchases belong to
the company, and the company maintains the sole right to determine its periodic
scrap needs, including the extent to which it may employ scrap substitutes in
lieu of, or in addition to, steel scrap. The company retains the right to
acquire up to, but not in excess of, 20% of its steel scrap purchased in any
calendar quarter, not to exceed 125,000 tons in such calendar quarter, from
other sources. The agreement, which became effective July 1, 2002, extends
through December 31, 2004; however, either party may terminate the agreement at
anytime on or after July 1, 2003, provided that such party gives the other party
at least three full calendar months prior notice.
The company has entered into certain commitments with suppliers which are of a
customary nature within the steel industry. Commitments have been entered into
relating to future expected requirements for such commodities as natural gas,
electricity and certain transportation services. Certain commitments contain
provisions which require that the company take or pay for specified quantities
without regard to actual usage for periods of up to 3 years. During the years
ending December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the company has commitments for natural
gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment
provisions for approximately $179 million, $175 million and $93 million,
respectively. The company fully utilized all such take or pay requirements
during the past three years and purchased $140 million, $127 million and $90
million, during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
under these contracts. The company believes that production requirements will be
such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these
commitments will occur in the normal production process. The company purchases
its electricity consumed at its Flat Roll Division pursuant to a contract which
extends through December 2007. The contract designates 152 hours as
interruptible service during 2003, and these interruptible hours further
decrease annually through expiration of the agreement. The contract also
establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per Mill/kWh consumed for each
year through the expiration of the agreement. At December 31, 2002, the company
has outstanding construction-related commitments of $128 million related to the
rail mill construction and $157 million related to the addition of a coil
coating facility at the company Flat Roll Division.
The company is subject to litigation from time to time, which is incidental to
its business. The company, based upon current knowledge including discussions
with legal counsel, believes that the results of any threatened or pending
litigation will not have a material effect on the company financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.
NOTE 8. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES
The company sells various flat-rolled products to Heidtman and purchases steel
scrap resources from OmniSource, both of which are affiliated companies. The
president and chief executive officer of Heidtman is a member of the company
board of directors, and Heidtman is a stockholder of the company. During 2002,
the chairman of the board of directors of OmniSource resigned from the company
board of directors and was replaced by the president of OmniSource. Both of
these individuals were stockholders of the company.                    59

The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value,
because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying
value of long-term debt, including the current portion, approximates fair value
due to the interest being determined by variable rates, repricing periodically.
The fair value of the various interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be
a liability of $104 million and $88 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The fair values are estimated by the use of quoted market prices,
estimates obtained from brokers, and other appropriate valuation techniques
based on references available.
NOTE 10. RETIREMENT PLANS
The company sponsors a 401k retirement savings and profit sharing plan for
eligible employees, which is a qualified plan for federal income tax purposes.
The company total expense for the plan was $69 million, $424,000 and $46
million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
NOTE 11. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The company has two reportable segments: steel operations and steel scrap
substitute operations. The steel operations segment includes the company Flat
Roll Division, Structural and Rail Division, and Bar Division. The Flat Roll
Division sells a broad range of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and coated steel
products, including a large variety of specialty products such as thinner gauge
hot-rolled products and galvanized products. The Flat Roll Division sells
directly to end-users and service centers, including Heidtman, located primarily
in the Midwestern United States and these products are used in numerous industry
sectors, including the automotive, construction and commercial industries. The
company began significant construction of its Structural and Rail Division in
May 2001, with structural steel production commencing in the third quarter of
2002. Construction of the rail facility is continuing, with initial test
production anticipated to commence in the second quarter of 2003. This facility
produces and sells structural steel beams, pilings, and other steel components
directly to end-users and service centers for the construction, transportation
and industrial machinery markets. This facility is also designed to produce and
sell a variety of standard and premium-grade rails for the railroad industry. On
September 9, 2002, the company purchased the special bar quality mini-mill
assets of Qualitech Steel SBQ, LLC. The company plans to invest between $70 and
$75 million of additional capital to convert the facility to the production of
merchant bars and shapes and reinforcing bar products, with an anticipated
annual production capacity of between 500,000 and 600,000 tons. The company
anticipates initial production will begin during the first quarter of 2004 and
anticipates marketing the bar products directly to end-users and to service
centers for the construction, transportation and industrial machinery markets.
Steel scrap substitute operations include the revenues and expenses associated
with the company wholly owned subsidiary, Iron Dynamics. From the time
operations were halted in 2001 through the fourth quarter of 2002, the costs
incurred at IDI were composed of those expenses required to maintain the
facility and further evaluate the project and its related benefits. On July 10,
2002, IDI announced that it would begin experimental production trials in the
fourth quarter of 2002. These trials utilized a modified production process. IDI
successfully completed certain operating trials which may significantly reduce
the eventual per-unit cost of liquid pig iron production. Additional
modifications and refinements required to implement this modified production
process at the IDI facility are estimated to cost approximately $140 million,
and are expected to be completed during 2003. The company recently announced its
intent to restart IDI during the second half of 2003.
Revenues included in the category All Other are from two subsidiary operations
that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments.
These revenues are from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and
steel decking for the non-residential construction industry; from the further
processing, or slitting, and sale of certain steel products; and from the resale                    60

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
of certain secondary and excess steel products. In addition, All Other also
includes certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company senior
secured credit facilities, senior unsecured notes, convertible subordinated
notes and certain other investments.
The company operations are primarily organized and managed by operating
segment. Operating segment performance and resource allocations are primarily
based on operating results before income taxes. The accounting policies of the
reportable segments are consistent with those described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. Intersegment sales and any related profits are eliminated
in consolidation. The external net sales of the company steel operations
include sales to non-U.S. companies of $101 million, $80 million and $103
million, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The

NOTE 14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 14, 2003, the company purchased the galvanizing assets of GalvPro II,
LLC, for $175 million, plus the potential of an additional $15 million based
on an earn-out formula. This steel coating facility is located in
Jeffersonville, Indiana, and has an estimated annual production capacity of
between 300,000 and 350,000 tons of light-gauge, hot-dipped, cold-rolled
galvanized steel. The company anticipates investing between $20 and $60
million of additional capital for certain equipment modifications and
improvements. The facility will be operated as a cost-center of the company
Flat Roll Division. The company anticipates production will begin mid-2003 and
believes this addition will increase its percentage of value-added product
sales.
On February 27, 2003, the company announced that it was increasing its ownership
in its consolidated subsidiary NMBS from 466% ownership to 100% through a
acquisition of the 466% ownership interest in NMBS previously held by New
Process Steel Corporation New Process, a privately held Houston, Texas, steel
processor, which the company has already consummated at a cost of $35 million,
plus the purchase of New Process' portion of NMBS subordinated notes payable,
including accrued interest, to New Process for $39 million, and b an
agreement to acquire the remaining 68% stake held by other minority investors,
during the first quarter of 2003. NMBS began production in 2000 and produces
joists, girders, trusses and steel roof and floor decking, which is sold
primarily in the upper Midwest non-residential building components market.                    66
