Notes to Financial  F-7                                 Report of Independent Auditors The Stockholders and Board of Directors
of PSW Technologies, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of PSW Technologies, Inc. as of
December 31, 1997 and 1998 and the related statements of income loss,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of PSW Technologies, Inc. at
December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.                              /s/ Ernst & Young LLP  Austin, Texas

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
Pencom Systems Incorporated Pencom provided software services via a separate
division the Software Division that commenced operations in October 1989. In
addition, a portion of a software services contract was allocated between the
other operations of Pencom and the Software Division. Effective October 1, 1996,
Pencom contributed to PSW the business of the Software Division, including the
portion of the software contract that had previously been allocated to the other
operations of Pencom see Note 3. In exchange for the net assets contributed,
Pencom received all of the then issued and outstanding shares of PSW and PSW
issued warrants to Pencom and to certain Pencom employees to purchase an
aggregate of 507,654 shares of PSW common stock at $04 per share. The shares
and warrants issued to Pencom were immediately thereafter distributed to Pencom
shareholders. This exchange has been accounted for in a manner similar to a
pooling of interests and accordingly, the accompanying financial statements
include the operations of the Software Division and the aforementioned portion
of the software services contract allocated to other operations of Pencom for
all periods presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions,
including estimates to complete contracts, that affect the reported amounts in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
Share Information
All outstanding share amounts included in the accompanying financial statements
have been adjusted to reflect an 11,250-for-1 forward stock split effected on
December 18, 1996 and the 8-for-13 reverse stock split described in Note 3.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized during the period for
which the services are provided.
Revenue  from  fixed  price  contracts  is  recognized  using  the
percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of units of labor
incurred to the date of measurement relative to the estimated total units of
labor at completion. The cumulative impact of revisions in estimates of the
percentage to complete is reflected in the period in which the revisions are
made. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a
contract-by-contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses
are determined. Revenue earned in excess of billings is classified as unbilled
revenue under customer contracts. Billings in excess of earned revenue are
classified as deferred revenue. Revenue excludes reimbursable expenses.                    F-7               PSW Technologies, Inc.

Costs and Expenses
Technical staff expense consists of the cost of i salaries, payroll taxes,
health insurance and workers' compensation for technical staff personnel
assigned to client projects, ii unassigned technical staff personnel and iii
fees paid to subcontractors for work performed in connection with client
projects.
Selling and administrative staff expense consists of i the cost of salaries,
payroll taxes, health insurance and workers' compensation for selling and
administrative personnel and ii all commissions and bonuses.
Pencom allocated certain expenses to the Software Division, including corporate
and officers' salaries, interest and rent. Corporate and officers' salaries were
allocated based upon the percentage of time expended by certain individuals on
Software Division matters. Interest was allocated based upon interest incurred
by Pencom on its secured debt see Note 7. Rent was allocated based on square
footage and/or employee head count. It is management opinion that the
estimated cost of the allocated expenses on a stand alone basis would not
produce materially different results than those reflected in the 1996 financial
statements.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of
credit risk consist principally of cash balances, short-term investments and
trade accounts receivable. The Company invests its excess cash in highly liquid
investments short-term bank deposits and places its investments in high
quality securities with financial institutions of high credit standing. The
Company does not require collateral from its customers. The Company maintains
allowances for potential credit losses and such losses were not material for any
of the periods presented. The Company customers are headquartered primarily in
North America.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization are computed based on the cost of the related
assets, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets which range from five to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the term of the related lease or estimated life of the leasehold
improvements, whichever is shorter.
Advertising Expense
The Company expenses advertising costs when the advertisement occurs. Total
advertising expense amounted to approximately $175,000 and $50,000 in 1997 and
1998, respectively. Advertising costs were not material for 1996.                    F-8 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued
Stock Based Compensation
The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions for stock-based compensation
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS 123 prescribes
accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based compensation plans,
including employee stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase
plans and stock appreciation rights. SFAS 123 requires compensation expense to
be recorded i using the new fair value method or ii using existing
accounting rules prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees  APB  25 and  related
interpretations with pro forma disclosure of what net income and earnings per
share would have been had the Company adopted the new fair value method. The
Company intends to continue to account for its stock based compensation plans in
accordance with the provisions of APB 25 as permitted by SFAS 123.
Income Taxes
Upon formation, in August 1996, the Company elected to be treated as a
Subchapter S corporation, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended,
whereby federal income taxes are the  responsibility  of the individual
stockholders. Accordingly, the Company did not provide for federal income taxes.
With the closing of the Company initial public offering, the Company
Subchapter S status was terminated and the Company became subject to federal
corporate income taxes.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, deferred income taxes were provided for all
temporary differences existing at the date of the Company termination of its
Subchapter S status. This statement prescribes the use of the liability method
whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based
on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Pro Forma Earnings Per Share
The unaudited pro forma adjustments on the statements of income reflect an
adjustment to record a provision for income taxes as if the Company had not been
an S corporation.
The pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share amounts prior to the
Company initial public offering, which occurred during the second quarter of
1997, have been restated as required to comply with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, and the Securities and
Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 98.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been restated to
conform with the current year presentation.
3.  Stockholders' Equity
Effective October 1, 1996, in connection with the contribution of the business
of the Software Division, the Company issued 5,538,463 shares of common stock
and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 507,654 shares of common stock at $04
per share. All warrants were exercisable upon issuance and expire in October,
2006. In exchange for the shares and warrants issued, PSW received an assignment
of a 2667% interest in the proceeds to be received from the accounts receivable
as of September 30, 1996 and substantially all the other assets and liabilities
of the Software Division. The net assets contributed amounted to approximately
$2,100,000 see also note 2.                    F-9 3. Stockholders' Equity continued
On February 3, 1997, the Company Board of Directors approved i. an 8-for-13
reverse stock split, which was effected on April 2, 1997, ii. an increase in
the Company authorized common stock from 11,250,000 to 34,000,000 shares and
iii. an authorization of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock of $01 par value.
In June 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of 2,850,000
shares of its authorized but unissued Common Stock at a price to the public of
$900 per share. In connection with the initial public offering, the Company
granted the underwriters of the offering an option to purchase up to 427,500
shares of Common Stock to cover over-allotments. On July 2, 1997, the
underwriters exercised their option, purchasing 427,500 shares of the Company
Common Stock. These transactions resulted in total net proceeds from the initial
public offering of $257 million after deducting offering expenses and the
underwriters discount of approximately $38 million. The proceeds of the
offering were used to repay indebtedness, to pay certain corporate income tax
obligations of the Company and to pay dividends to existing stockholders of the
Company in amounts estimated to approximate certain of their 1997 income tax
obligations, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
As discussed in Note 12, the Company S corporation status was terminated
immediately upon completion of its initial public offering. Additionally, the
Company was required to change its method of tax accounting from the cash to
accrual method. During 1997, the Company declared and paid a dividend of $14
million to the stockholders of the Company prior to the termination of the S
corporation status to pay the income taxes for the 1997 taxable earnings of the
Company allocated to them. The dividend payment was an estimate based upon
numerous assumptions, including taxable income attributable to the conversion
from the cash to the accrual method of accounting upon the termination of the
Company S corporation status.
In May 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
Company 1996 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan to increase the number of shares
of Common Stock authorized to be issued by 1,000,000 shares resulting in
2,715,000 shares available for issuance under the plan.
In September 1998, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repricing of
options to purchase 737,495 shares of Common Stock effective as of the close of
business on September 29, 1998 to the then fair market value of $194 per share.
Under the terms of the repricing, the repriced options shall become exercisable
in four successive equal annual installments from the September 29,1998 grant
date. The repriced options have a maximum term of ten years measured from this
date of grant. The Chief Executive Officer did not participate in the repricing.
At December 31, 1998, the Company has reserved 505,654 shares of Common Stock
for issuance in connection with warrants outstanding and 2,647,000 shares of
Common Stock for issuance under the Company stock purchase and stock option
plans.

F-10 5.  Short-Term Investments
The Company determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time
of purchase and re-evaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The
short-term investments have been classified as available-for-sale and are
carried at fair value quoted market prices, with unrealized holding gains and
losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost of
debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts to maturity. Such amortization, interest income, realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included in
net interest and other income.
Information related to the Company short-term investments at December 31, 1997
and 1998 are as follows in thousands                   Amortized      Unrealized     Unrealized      Market

Gross gains and gross losses on the sale of investments were not significant in
1997 and 1998. Short-term investments are generally comprised of variable rate
securities that provide for optional or early redemption within twelve months
and the contractual maturities are generally greater than twelve months.

F-11 7.  Note Payable to Bank
The Company has a revolving line of credit with a bank which was amended and
extended until May 1, 1999 and provides for borrowings of up to $10 million,
subject to a borrowing base requirement. Borrowings under the line of credit
bear interest at the greater of a the bank prime rate or b the Federal
Funds Rate plus 025 percent. At the Company election, borrowings can be
converted to loans which bear interest at a rate computed based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. The weighted average borrowing rate on the
line of credit was 84% for 1997. The Company did not draw on the line of credit
during 1998. The line of credit contained certain restrictive convenants which,
among other things, required the Company to maintain a minimum net worth and to
meet certain financial ratios. At December 31, 1998, there was no amount
outstanding and the available borrowing amount was $75 million.
Interest expense includes interest allocated by Pencom through September 30,
1996. The allocation represented the Software Division share of interest
payments paid by Pencom under its line of credit and was based on the ratio of
the monthly balance of the Software Division accounts receivable to total
accounts receivable of the Software Division and Pencom. This line of credit was
collateralized by all accounts receivable and fixed assets for Pencom and bore
interest at a rate based on the bank prime rate or alternative LIBOR pricing,
based on LIBOR plus 25%.
8.  Significant Customers
One customer and two of its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  accounted  for
approximately 52%, 39% and 35% of total revenue for the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. This customer accounted for approximately 18%
of accounts receivable at December 31, 1998. Another customer accounted for
approximately 14% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 1996. No
other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 1996, 1997 or 1998.
9.  Employee Benefit Plans
Stock Option Plan
Effective October 1, 1996, the Company Board of Directors and stockholders
approved and adopted the PSW Technologies, Inc. 1996 Stock Option/ Stock
Issuance Plan the 1996 Plan. The aggregate number of shares issuable under
the 1996 Plan has been increased to 2,715,000 shares of the Company common
stock for issuance to employees, directors and consultants of the Company.
Incentive stock options as defined in Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 and nonqualified stock options may be issued under the 1996 Plan. The
exercise price for incentive stock options may not be less than fair market
value on the date of grant, or such greater amount necessary to qualify as an
incentive stock option. The options outstanding under the 1996 Plan generally
vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of
the grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant. Certain of these options
are subject to acceleration clauses.
Pursuant to the organization of the Company and the contribution of net assets
of the Software Division, the Company granted replacement options for shares of
its common stock under the 1996 Plan to its employees who participated in the
Pencom Option Plan and the Pencom Option Plan was terminated. The replacement
options were granted for the same number of shares and at the same exercise
price as those options granted to the employees under the Pencom Option Plan.
The grant date determining vesting was the original grant date under the Pencom
Option Plan. Under APB 25, the difference between the estimated fair market
value of the Company common stock and the options' exercise prices on the date
of issuance was determined to be approximately $2,179,000. This charge is being
amortized for financial reporting purposes over the vesting period of the
options and the amount recognized as expense during the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997 and 1998 amounting to approximately $1,538,000, $268,000 and $75,000,
respectively, is included in special compensation expense. A deferred tax
benefit is recorded for the amortized compensation expense.                    F-12               PSW Technologies, Inc.

Notes to the Financial Statements continued
9.  Employee Benefit Plans continued
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
On February 3, 1997, the Board of Directors adopted the Company Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan that allows eligible employees to purchase
shares of Common Stock, at semi-annual intervals, through periodic payroll
deductions under the Purchase Plan. A reserve of 400,000 shares of common stock
has been established for this purpose. The stockholders of the Company approved
the Purchase Plan on March 17, 1997.
The Purchase Plan incorporates a series of successive offering periods, each
generally with a duration of six months. The initial purchase period began on
the date of the initial public offering see Note 3 and ended on October 31,
1997. Thereafter, purchase periods begin on the first business day in November
and May of each year and end on the last business day of April and October,
respectively. Shares of Common Stock are purchased for each participant at the
end of each purchase period. The Company sold 53,732 and 93,747 shares of Common
Stock to employees through the Purchase Plan in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
Payroll deductions may not exceed 15% of base salary for each purchase period
and each employee purchases are limited to 500 shares per purchase period. The
purchase price per share is eighty-five percent of the lower of i the fair
market value of the Common Stock on the start date of the purchase period or
ii the fair market value at the end of the semi-annual purchase period. The
Purchase Plan will terminate on the last business day of April, 2007.
As specified in APB No. 25, the sale of Common Stock under the Purchase Plan
does not result in compensation expense to the Company. Under SFAS 123, however,
expense would be recognized, and accordingly, approximately $408,000 and $52,000
of pro forma compensation expense relating to the sale of Common Stock under the
Purchase Plan is included in the calculation of pro forma net income and pro
forma basic earnings per share and pro forma diluted earnings per share
resulting from the grant of stock options during 1997 and 1998, respectively,
below. The assumptions used to value the compensation expense resulting from the
issuance of shares under the Purchase Plan do not differ materially from the
assumptions used to value the 1997 and 1998 stock options.
Employee Retirement Plan
The Company maintains a defined contribution plan the Plan pursuant to
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code for employees who are at least 21
years of age. Eligible employees can elect to reduce their current compensation
up to the statutory prescribed limit and have the amount of such reduction
contributed to the Plan. The Plan also allows for the Company to make
contributions on behalf of eligible employees. A similar plan in which employees
of the Software Division were eligible to participate was maintained by Pencom.
The Company contributed approximately $132,000 to the Plan in 1998. No
contributions were made to the Plan in 1996 or 1997 by the Software Division or
PSW.                    F-14 9.  Employee Benefit Plans continued
Pro forma Information
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by
SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for option
grants under the 1996 Plan and purchases of Common Stock under the Purchase Plan
using the fair value method of that Statement. The fair value of the options was
estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions                        1996 Option Grants

Average life                 3 years       6 years      6 years     6 years The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have  characteristics  significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options
under SFAS 123 is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. For the
years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, pro forma net income loss under
SFAS 123 amounted to approximately $658,000, $27 million and $47 million,
respectively and pro forma basic earnings loss per share and pro forma diluted
earnings loss per share under SFAS 123 amounted to approximately $012 and
$009 in 1996, $036 and $032 in 1997 and $052 and $052 in 1998,
respectively.
10.  Related Party Transactions
The Company utilizes non-exclusive recruiting services provided by Pencom.
Management believes that the terms and fees paid in connection with such
recruiting services are comparable to agreements maintained by the Company with
other unrelated recruiting firms and will continue to use these recruiting
services on a non-exclusive basis pursuant to an agreement entered into with
Pencom. In addition, certain expenses were allocated by Pencom to the Software
Division. Management believes that the allocations were reasonable. Services
provided and expenses allocated to PSW were as follows in thousands                                    Year ended December 31,

The premises previously occupied by the Company in Texas were leased by Pencom.
In connection with the office relocation, the Company transferred leasehold
improvements with a net book value of approximately $69,000 to Pencom. Pencom
has subleased these premises. However, the Company entered into an agreement
with Pencom to guarantee Pencom sublease income. Future minimum sublease
rental income that the Company has guaranteed is as follows Years ending December 31 in thousands:
1999                          $     380
2000                               285
Total                          $    665
Rent expense, including rent allocated by Pencom, for the years ended December
31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 was approximately $601,000, $1,258,000 and $1,566,000,
respectively.
12. Income Taxes
From commencement through June 5, 1997, the Company had elected to be treated as
an S Corporation under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. As such, federal income taxes attributable to income through June 5,
1997, were the responsibility of the individual stockholders.
As a result of the initial public offering in June of 1997, the Company
Subchapter S status was terminated for federal and state tax purposes and the
Company  recorded a deferred tax charge against income of approximately
$1,200,000 for the cumulative differences between the financial reporting and
income tax basis of certain assets and liabilities existing at that date.
Additionally, the Company was required to change its method of accounting from
the cash basis to the accrual basis for income tax reporting purposes.
The Company stockholders were obligated to pay the 1997 income taxes related
to the period up to the completion of the offering. The Company declared and
paid a dividend of $1,400,000 to its stockholders of record immediately prior to
the completion of the public offering for the amount estimated to approximate
the 1997 income taxes payable by the stockholders.
F-16 12.  Income Taxes continued
The pro forma disclosures on the statements of income reflect adjustments to
record provisions for income taxes as if the Company had not been an S
Corporation. The pro forma provision for income taxes for the year ended
December 31, 1996, of $441,000 is computed using an effective tax rate of 38 which differs from the federal statutory rate of 34% primarily due to state
taxes. The pro forma provision for income taxes of $1,900,000 attributable to
December 31, 1997, is computed using an effective tax rate of 35%, which differs
from the federal statutory rate of 34% as a result of state taxes and tax-exempt
income. The tax benefit for income taxes of $1,060,000 attributable to December
31, 1998, is computed using an effective tax rate of 42% which differs from the
federal statutory rate of 34% as a result of state taxes and tax-exempt income.
Significant components of the provision benefit for income taxes are as
follows                          1997       1998
Current:
Federal                    $ 1,526    $  505

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company deferred taxes as of December 31 are as follows                            1997        1998
Deferred tax assets:
Allowances and reserves             $  183      $  122

Total deferred tax liabilities            1,497       668
Net deferred tax liabilities            $ 493     $   18
The exercise of certain stock options which have been granted under the
Company stock option plan give rise to compensation which is includable in the
taxable income of the applicable option holder and deductible by the Company for
federal and state income tax purposes. Any realized tax benefit arising from
exercised options in excess of the benefit previously recorded, as discussed in
Notes 9 and 13, is credited to additional paid-in capital.
13.  Special Compensation Expense
As described in Notes 9 and 10, charges to income were made related to the
replacement options issued to employees and the cancellation of a note from an
officer and stockholder of the Company which totaled $2,193,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1996. Amortization of deferred compensation of $268,000 and
$75,000 was recognized for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998,
respectively. These transactions reduced income from operations, net income and
diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998
as follows in thousands, except per share data                           1996a       1997a        1998

basis as if the Company had been subject to federal and state income taxes.
The pro forma diluted earnings per share amounts prior to the Company
initial public offering, which occurred during the second quarter of 1997,
have been restated as required to comply with SFAS No. 128 and the
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 98 SAB 98.
The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 128 and SAB 98 resulted in an
increase to pro forma diluted earnings per share for 1996 of $01 per
share.
Deferred compensation as of December 31, 1998 of approximately $44,000 will be
amortized over the remaining vesting periods in 1999 and 2000.                    F-18 14.    Earnings per Share

The pro forma basic and pro forma diluted earnings per share amounts prior
to the Company initial public offering, which occurred during the second
quarter of 1997, have been restated as required to comply with SFAS No. 128
and the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 98
SAB 98. The adoption of the provisions of SFAS 128 and SAB 98 resulted
in an increase to pro forma diluted earnings per share for 1996 of $01 per
share.
Options to purchase 174 million shares of Common Stock at an average exercise
price of $273 per share were outstanding at December 31, 1998, but were not
included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as its effect would be
anti-dilutive.                    F-19 15.  Comprehensive Income
As of January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. SFAS No. 130 establishes new rules for the reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components; however, the adoption of this Statement
had no impact on the Company net income or stockholders' equity. SFAS No. 130
requires unrealized gains or losses on the Company  available-for-sale
securities, which prior to adoption were reported separately in shareholders'
equity, to be included in other comprehensive income. Prior year financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the requirements of SFAS No.
130.
The components of comprehensive income for the years ended 1996, 1997 and 1998
are as follows                            1996a       1997a        1998

16.    Litigation
The Company is involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the outcome of
such current legal proceedings, claims and litigation could have a material
effect on quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows when resolved in a
future period. However, in the opinion of management, these matters will not
materially affect the Company financial position.                    F-20 17.    Quarterly Information Unaudited
