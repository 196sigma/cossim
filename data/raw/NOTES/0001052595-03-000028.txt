Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants

WestCoast Hospitality Corporation
Spokane, Washington
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WestCoast
Hospitality Corporation and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of WestCoast
Hospitality Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill in 2002.

WestCoast Hospitality Corporation
Notes to Financial Statements
1. Organization
WestCoast Hospitality Corporation the Company is primarily engaged in the
ownership, management, development, and franchising of mid scale, full service
hotels. As of December 31, 2002, the system contained 86 properties in 15
states, totaling over 15,000 rooms and over 717,000 square feet of meeting
space. The Company owned an interest in and operated 29 hotels, leased 14
hotels, managed seven hotels owned by others and franchised 36 hotels owned and
operated by third parties at December 31, 2002. The Company hotel brands
include WestCoastR and RedLionR. All properties are located in the United
States.
The Company is also engaged in activities related or supplementary to the
operation of hotels. These activities include computerized ticketing services
and presenting entertainment productions through its TicketsWest division and
owning,  leasing,  developing and/or managing  commercial and residential
properties through its G Real Estate division.
The Company was incorporated in the State of Washington on April 25, 1978. A
substantial portion of the Company assets are held in WestCoast Hospitality
Limited Partnership WHLP. WHLP was formed in the State of Delaware on
October 23, 1997. The Company is the sole general partner and approximately 98%
owner of WHLP and manages its operations.
The consolidated  financial statements include the accounts of WestCoast
Hospitality Corporation, its wholly owned subsidiaries, its general and limited
partnership interest in WHLP, a 50% interest in a limited partnership and its
equity basis investment in two limited partnerships. All of these entities are
collectively referred to as the Company or WestCoast. All significant
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining
maturities at time of purchase of three months or less. The Company places its
cash with high credit quality institutions. At times, cash balances may be in
excess of federal insurance limits.
The Company maintains several trust accounts for owners of real properties which
it manages. These cash accounts are not owned by the Company and therefore, are
not included in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2002 and
2001,  these  accounts  totaled  approximately  $2,140,000 and $1,753,000
respectively.
At December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, $19 million and $11 million,
respectively was reserved for the future payment of insurance, furniture and
fixtures and personal taxes for four specific hotel properties in accordance
with bank debt requirements.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically
identified amounts that the Company believes to be uncollectible and those
accounts that are past due beyond a certain date. If actual collections
experience changes, revisions to the allowance may be required. After all
attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off
against the allowance.
The following schedule summarizes the activity in the allowance account for
trade accounts receivable for the past three years in thousands                                         
2002       2001       2000

Deductions, net of recoveries           886       207      389
Balance, end of year              $  587      $ 420     $  49
Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage products held for sale at the
restaurants operated by the Company. Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value.
Assets Held for Sale
The Company buildings which are held for sale are recorded at the lower of
their historical carrying value cost less accumulated depreciation or market
value. Depreciation is terminated when the asset is determined to be held for
sale.
Page 28
In order to qualify as an asset held for sale in accordance with SFAS 144, the
asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year
unless during the one year period, circumstances arise that previously were
considered unlikely and, as a result a long-lived asset previously classified as
held for sale is not sold by the end of that period and 1 during the initial
one year period the Company initiated actions necessary to respond to the change
in circumstances, 2 the asset is being actively marketed at a price that is
reasonable given the change in circumstances.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the
related assets or the lease term as follows     Buildings                 25-40 years
Equipment                 3-20 years
Furniture and fixtures          5-15 years
Landscaping and land improvements     15 years
Major additions and betterments are capitalized. Costs of maintenance and
repairs which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are
expensed currently.  When items are disposed of, the related costs and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
recognized in operations. Management of the Company periodically reviews the net
carrying value of all properties to determine whether there has been a permanent
impairment of value and assesses the need for any write-downs in carrying value.
Interest Capitalization
The Company capitalizes interest costs during the construction period for
qualifying assets. During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, the
Company capitalized approximately $84,000, $253,000 and $468,000 of interest
costs, respectively.
Brand Name, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Brand name and goodwill are indefinite life intangible assets attributable to
the purchase prices of acquisitions, which were in excess of the estimated fair
values of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Through
December 31, 2001 these assets were being amortized over 20 to 40 years.
Other intangible assets include lease, management and franchise contracts. The
costs of these contracts are amortized over the weighted-average remaining term
of approximately nine years. At December 31, 2002, the cost and accumulated
amortization  of these  contracts  was $104  million and $21 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2001, the cost and accumulated amortization of
these contracts was $109 and $13 million, respectively. Amortization expense
related to these contracts for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
was approximately $860,000, $649,000 and $631,000 respectively.
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Intangible
Assets, which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and intangible
assets. Under SFAS 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
will no longer be amortized, but will be tested for impairment annually and also
in the event of an impairment indicator. The Company evaluated the goodwill,
finite and indefinite life of intangible assets and determined that there was no
impairment during 2002.
The adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002, resulted in the elimination of
goodwill amortization of $855,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Accumulated amortization at December 31, 2002 and 2001 remained the same at
approximately $2,079,000 since during 2002 there was no additional amortization.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of the Company long-lived assets are reviewed when events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred
based on expected net future cash flows of the asset, then an impairment loss is
recognized in the income statement using a fair value based method.
Other Assets
Other assets primarily includes amounts expended for deferred loan fees,
purchase option payments, straight-line rental income, a minority interest in a
limited liability company, investments in partnerships and a note receivable.
Deferred loan fees are amortized using the interest method over the term of the
related loan agreement. The Company has deferred purchase option payments made
pursuant to purchase agreements for hotel properties which are currently being
leased and operated by the Company. If the options are exercised, the option
payments will be amortized as part of the purchase price of the hotels. If the
options are not exercised, the option payments will be charged to operations.
The Company investment in the limited liability company is accounted for under
the cost method. Investment in a partnership over which the Company can exercise
significant influence is accounted for by the equity method, under which the
Company recognizes its proportionate share of partnership earnings and treats
distributions as a reduction in its investment.
The Company $26 million note receivable at December 31, 2002 bears interest
at 736%. Monthly principal and interest is due until August 2007 when the note
is due in full.
Income Taxes
WestCoast Hospitality Corporation is a tax paying entity and accounts for income
taxes using the liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be determined based on the temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
tax attributes using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
temporary differences are expected to reverse.
WHLP and the other partnerships which are partially or wholly owned by WestCoast
Hospitality Corporation are not tax paying entities. However, the income tax
attributes of these partnerships flow through to the respective partners of the
partnerships.
Page 30
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is generally recognized as services are performed. Hotel and restaurant
revenue primarily represent room rental and food and beverage sales from owned,
leased and consolidated joint venture hotels and are recognized at the time of
the hotel stay or sale of the restaurant services. Hotel and restaurant revenues
also include management fees the Company earns from managing third party owned
hotels. These fees totaled $19 million, $23 million and $22 million for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Franchise, Central
Services and Development fees represent fees received in connection with the
franchise of the Company brand name as well as central purchasing, development
and other fees. Franchise fees are recognized as earned in accordance with the
contractual terms of the franchise agreements. Other fees are recognized when
the services are provided.
Real Estate Division income represents both lease income on owned commercial and
retail properties as well as property management income, development fees and
leasing and sales commissions from residential and commercial properties managed
by the Company, typically under long-term contracts with the property owner.
Lease revenues are recognized over the period of the leases. The Company records
rental income from operating leases which contain fixed escalation clauses on
the straight-line method. The difference between income earned and lease
payments received from the tenants is included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets.  Rental income from retail leases which is
contingent upon the lessees' revenues is recorded as income in the period
earned. Management fees, development fees and leasing and sales commissions are
recognized as these services are performed.
TicketsWest income includes primarily earnings from ticketing and entertainment
operations. Where the Company acts as an agent and receives a net fee or
commission, it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are
performed. When the Company is the promoter of an event and is at risk for the
production, revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event
performance.
Earnings Per Common Share
Net income per common share-basic is computed by dividing income applicable to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Net income per common share-diluted is computed by adjusting
income applicable to common shareholders by the effect of the minority interest
related to Operating  Partnership  Units OP Units and  increasing the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding by the effect of the OP
Units and the additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the
dilutive potential common shares stock options and convertible notes had been
issued, to the extent that such issuance would be dilutive.
Stock Based Compensation
As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company has chosen to measure
compensation cost for stock-based employee  compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and to provide the
disclosure only requirements of SFAS 123.
On December 31, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB
amended the transition and disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 through the
issuance of FASB Statement No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transistion and Disclosure SFAS No. 148. SFAS No. 148 amends the existing
disclosures to make more frequent and prominent disclosure of stock-based
compensation expense beginning with financial statements for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2002.
The Company has chosen not to record compensation expense using fair value
measurement provisions in the statement of income. Had compensation cost for
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under the plans, reported net income and income per share would have been
changed to the pro forma amounts indicated below dollars in thousands, except
per share amounts                                    Year Ended December 31,

Advertising and Promotion
The Company generally expenses all costs associated with its advertising and
promotional efforts as incurred. During the years ending December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 the Company incurred $63 million, $24 million, and $22 million,
respectively of advertising expenses.
Central Program Fund
Effective January 1, 2002 the Company established the WestCoast Central Program
Fund CPF, organized in accordance with the various domestic franchise
agreements. The CPF is responsible for certain advertising services, frequent
guest program administration, reservation services, national sales promotions
and brand and revenue management services intended to increase sales and enhance
the reputation of the Company and its franchise owners including the WestCoast
and Red Lion branded properties.
Contributions by the Company to the CPF for owned and managed hotels and
contributions by the franchisees, through the individual franchise agreements,
total up to 5% of room revenue or can be based on reservation fees, frequent
guest program dues and other services. While the Company administers the
functions of the CPF, the net assets and transactions of the CPF are not
commingled with the working capital of the Company. The net assets and
transactions of the CPF are, therefore, not included in the accompanying
financial statements in accordance with FASB No. 45, Accounting for Franchise
Fee Revenue.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company contributed $57 million to
the CPF with respect to its owned and managed properties, which was recognized
in direct operating expenses. At December 31, 2002, the Company has a net
current receivable from the CPF of approximately $223 thousand.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, which amends SFAS No. 19. This statement addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This
statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
estimate of fair value can be made. The requirements of this statement must be
implemented for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002; however, early
adoption is encouraged. The adoption of this statement is not expected to have a
material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements.
The FASB also issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting
for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. It supersedes SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No.
30, Reporting the Results of Operations - Reporting the Effects of Disposal of
a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business. The
adoption of this statement on January 1, 2002 did not have a material effect on
the Company consolidated financial statements.
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.
SFAS No. 145  updates,  clarifies  and  simplifies  existing  accounting
pronouncements, by rescinding SFAS No. 4, which required all gains and losses
from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an
extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria
in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 will now be used to classify those
gains and losses. Additionally, SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13 to require that
certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback
transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale-leaseback transactions.
Finally,  SFAS No. 145 also makes  technical  corrections  to  existing
pronouncements. While those corrections are not substantive in nature, in some
instances, they may change accounting practice. The provisions of SFAS No. 145
that amend SFAS No. 13 are effective for transactions occurring after May 15,
2002 with all other provisions of SFAS No. 145 being required to be adopted by
the Company on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 in 2003 has not had
a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize
costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather
than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs
covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee
severance costs that are associated with a  restructuring,  discontinued
operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146
replaces the prior guidance that was provided by EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an
Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No. 146 is
to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. Management currently believes that the adoption of SFAS No.
146 will not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No.
123. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that
voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123
to require prominent disclosure about the effects of reported net income of an
entity accounting policy decisions with respect to stock-based employee
compensation. Finally, this Statement amends APB Opinion No. 28, Interim
Financial Reporting, to require disclosure about those effects in interim
financial  information.  The amendments to SFAS No. 123, which provides
alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation is
effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2002. The amendment to SFAS No. 123 relating to disclosures and the amendment to
Opinion 28 is effective for financial reports containing condensed financial
statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Management
currently believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 148 will not have a material
impact on the financial statements.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting for Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34, Disclosure of
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45. FIN 45 clarifies the
requirements for a guarantor accounting for and disclosure of certain
guarantees issued and outstanding. It also requires a guarantor to recognize, at
the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. This interpretation also incorporates
without consideration the guidance in FASB Interpretation No. 34, which is being
superseded. The adoption of FIN 45 will not have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements and will be applied prospectively.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements FIN 46. FIN 46 clarifies the
application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
The adoption of FIN 46 will not have a material effect on the consolidated
financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2002
presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income or retained
earnings as previously reported.
Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results could materially differ from those
estimates.
3. Financial Liquidity
At December 31, 2002 the Company has a deficit working capital position of $288
million. This position is a direct result of the classification of $521 million
of obligations outstanding under the Company primary revolving credit facility
with a bank as a current liability. As further discussed in Note 10, the
classification is due to the anticipatory breach of certain financial covenants
to be measured in June, September and December 2003.
The Company intends to refinance its revolving credit facility either with its
existing lender or other lenders into  non-recourse and revolving debt.
Management believes that an adequate borrowing base exists to secure the
necessary financing. The Company is also pursuing the sale of certain non-core
real estate assets, some of which are included in assets held for sale discussed
in Note 5. Management has implemented certain operational efficiencies and cost
reduction plans that are expected to improve covenant ratios. These actions are
intended to reduce the Company dependence on the revolving credit facility.
The historical cash flow of the Company has been adequate to service all its
normal operating needs, service all interest and regularly scheduled principal
payments and capital improvements. Due to the war and the perception of a weak
economy there can be no assurance that future operating performance will provide
adequate cash flow for the Company needs. The ability of the Company to
improve its working capital position through the refinance of its revolving
credit facility, improve operating results and dispose of non-core assets is
dependent upon lending market conditions, the achievement of future operating
efficiencies and the liquidity of the real estate market where the Company
assets are located. There can be no assurance that these efforts will be
successful.

4. Acquisition
Effective December 31, 2001, the Company completed the purchase of Red Lion
Hotels, Inc. Red Lion from Hilton Hotels Corporation Hilton including 9
owned hotels, 12 leased hotels, 4 licensed hotels and 22 franchised operating
hotels. The acquisition was made to add critical mass to the Company hotel
portfolio and expand the Company presence in additional markets. The hotels
were acquired for $20,252,000 in cash, 303,771 Class A preferred shares and
303,771 Class B preferred shares for total consideration of approximately
$52,600,000 including the cost of acquisition. The source of cash consideration
for the transaction was the Company available cash and advances under the
Company existing credit facility. The value of the preferred shares was
determined based on its stated redemption value, as discussed in Note 11.
The acquisition of Red Lion was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. As the acquisition occurred on the last day of the year ended
December 31, 2001, the results of operations of the acquired entity are not
included in the consolidated statements of income or cash flows.
The following table presents the allocation of the purchase price to the
acquired assets and liabilities in thousands

5. Assets Held for Sale
In connection with the Company decision in 2001 to sell non-core assets, on
October 10, 2002, the Company and American Capital Group, LLC entered into a
purchase and sale agreement for the WestCoast Kalispell Hotel and Kalispell
Center Mall. The agreement is subject to due diligence and is scheduled to close
in 2003. After the close, the WestCoast Kalispell Center Hotel will remain under
the WestCoast Hospitality Corporation brand and management, while American
Capital Group, LLC will oversee management for the mall. The net book value of
the hotel and mall was $129 million at December 31, 2002.
Additionally, two office buildings owned by the Company have been marketed for
sale which the Company expects to sell in 2003. The total net book value of
these buildings as of December 31, 2002 of $215 million is classified as assets
held for sale. These two buildings were initially classified as assets held for
sale at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, the Company management
evaluated the accounting criteria set forth in SFAS 144 and determined the
assets were still appropriately classified as assets for sale.

6. Property and Equipment
Property and equipment at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is summarized as follows
in thousands                                       
2002       2001
Buildings and equipment                 $ 202,411     $ 219,729
Furniture and fixtures                   20,530      21,413

Construction in progress                   6,907       3,483
$ 241,255     $ 257,656
Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 was
approximately $89 million, $89 million, and $83 million, respectively.
In the first quarter of 2002, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale
of an 801% interest in the WHC Building, while retaining the management of the
building, its lease of space, and the remaining ownership interest. At the time
of the sale the cost and accumulated depreciation of this building was $106
million and $40 million, respectively. The sale of the building resulted in a
pre-tax gain of $58 million, of which $30 million was recognized as a gain on
asset disposition in 2002. Due to retaining a partial lease of the building, a
portion of the gain is being deferred over the six-year lease term. During 2002,
the Company recognized $215,000 of the deferred gain. As of December 31, 2002,
the total deferred gain remaining is $26 million.
7. Other Investments
The Company has a 6% interest in a limited liability company, which is accounted
for under the cost method. Accordingly the Company investment is increased or
decreased by contributions, distributions, or impairments only.
The Company also has a 05% general partnership interest in one hotel property,
which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. As of March 2002,
the Company also has a 199% interest in the WHC Building see Note 6, which is
also accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Therefore, the Company
records its proportionate share of the earnings and losses of these entities in
the consolidated statements of income. The Company wrote-off its 03% interest
$73,000 in another hotel partnership, because the primary asset was sold in
November 2002.
At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded investment in these
investments was $225 million and $13 million, respectively. The underlying
assets, liabilities and operations of these entities are not recorded in the
consolidated  financial  statements.  The Company does not share in any
non-recourse debt that may be held by these entities in which equity interests
are held. Summarized unaudited financial information with respect to these
separate entities as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are
as follows in thousands                        2002         2001

December 31, 2002,  2001, and 2000 of $62,000,  $92,000,  and $100,000
respectively. Additionally the Company has recorded revenues from managing these
properties of $374,000, $382,000 and $317,000 during the years ended December

Some of the above debt agreements require the Company maintain a cash reserve
account for insurance, taxes, and furniture and fixture replacement. At December
31, 2002, this reserve was $19 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company refinanced some of its real
property by obtaining long-term debt and paying down the Company revolving
line of credit agreement see note 10. During the year ended December 31, 2001,
deferred loan fees associated with the debt repayments were charged to
operations as an extraordinary item on the consolidated statements of income.

9. Capital Lease Obligations
The Company leases certain equipment under capital leases. The imputed interest
rates on the leases range from 706% to 864%. Cost and accumulated amortization
of this equipment as of December 31, 2002 are approximately $2,342,000 and
$1,717,000, respectively. Cost and accumulated amortization of the equipment as
of December 31, 2001 are approximately $2,796,000 and $1,813,000, respectively.
The remaining minimum lease payments including interest of $277,000 are due
under these leases during 2003.
10. Notes Payable to Bank
During 2001, in connection with the refinancing of certain properties under
long-term debt facilities the Company revolving credit facility was amended
and reduced to $70 million. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, $521 million and
$543 million, respectively was outstanding under the credit facility. Any
outstanding borrowings bear interest based on the prime rate or LIBOR plus a
variable interest margin. At December 31, 2002, the interest rate on outstanding
borrowings ranged from 394% to 475%. At December 31, 2001, the interest rate
was 484%. The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was
397% and 487% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest only
payments are due monthly. The credit facility matures on June 30, 2005. The
credit facility requires the initial payment of a 1% fee plus an annual standby
fee of 050% in 2002, fees ranged from 025% to 050% in 2001. The credit
facility is collateralized by certain properties and requires the Company to
maintain certain financial ratios, minimum levels of cash flows and restricts
the payment of dividends. On December 23, 2002, the debt agreement was amended
and the credit facility was reduced to $585 million and three of the financial
covenants were modified such that compliance with them shall not be required
until June 30, 2003. The Company was in compliance with all required financial
covenants at December 31, 2002. The entire outstanding balance at December 31,
2002 has been classified as a current liability due to anticipatory breach of
some of the existing covenants in June, September and December 2003, which
currently have not been waived. If the Company breaches its covenants and the
breach is not waived by the lender, one of the lenders remedies under the credit
facility is to call the debt due at that time. The debt agreement allows the
Company to pay dividends as long as certain minimum financial ratios are
maintained. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company was restricted from
paying any dividends on common stock.
11. Stockholders' Equity
The Articles of Incorporation of the Company authorize 50 million common shares
and 5 million preferred shares. The preferred stock rights, preferences and
privileges will be determined by the Board of Directors.
As discussed in Note 4, as part of the Red Lion acquisition WestCoast issued
303,771 shares of Class A Preferred Stock and 303,771 of Class B Preferred Stock
on December 31, 2001. Both the Class A and Class B preferred shares have $001
par, a $50 stated value, and give the holder certain preferences upon any
liquidation of the Company, including payment of $50 per share plus any unpaid
dividends before any payment is made to common stockholders.
In addition, the Class A shares include a quarterly dividend requirement,
cumulative at 7%, and are redeemable at WestCoast option for $50 per share
plus unpaid dividends. The dividend requirement increases to 12% if the Company
misses two dividend payments, or to 14% upon the violation of certain
restrictive covenants or after January 30, 2005, if they have not been redeemed.
The Class B shares include a quarterly dividend requirement, cumulative at 10 and are redeemable at WestCoast option for $50 per share plus unpaid
dividends. The dividend requirement increases to 15% if the Company misses two
dividend payments, or to 20% upon the violation of certain restrictive covenants
or after January 30, 2008, if they have not been redeemed.

14. Operating Lease Commitments
The Company has various operating leases, the most significant are In October 1997, the Company began operating a hotel in Yakima, Washington under
an operating lease and purchase option agreement. The lease agreement is for a
period of 15 years with two five-year renewal options. The Company pays all
operating costs of the hotel plus monthly lease payments of $35,000 through
September 2003. Commencing October 2003, the monthly lease requirement will be
$52,083 and monthly payments shall increase by $5,208 each year thereafter. The
Company agreed to a $10 million option payment which allows the purchase of
this hotel at a fixed price. One-half of this option payment was paid in cash
and the remaining $500,000 was paid in August 2002. The option is exercisable by
the Company between March and September 2003 for a total purchase price of
$6,250,000. If the Company exercises its purchase option, the option payments
made by the Company will be applied against the total purchase price.
The Company began operating a hotel in Bellevue, Washington in January 2000 with
an operating lease and purchase option agreement. The lease agreement expires on
December 31, 2003. The Company pays monthly lease payments of $27,951 plus
additional rent as defined in the agreement. Additional rent includes hotel
operating and other costs. The purchase option is exercisable from July 2002
through January 31, 2004 at the Company option. The total purchase price of
the hotel under option is $12 million.
At December 31, 2001, the Company assumed a master lease agreement which covered
17 hotel properties including 12 which were part of the Red Lion acquisition.
The Company has entered into a sublease with Doubletree DTWC Corporation whereby
Doubletree DTWC Corporation will sublease 5 of these hotel properties from the
Company. The master lease agreement requires minimum monthly payments of $125
million plus contingent rents based on gross receipts from the 17 hotels. The
lease agreement expires in December 2020, but the Company has the option to
extend the term for three additional 5 year terms.
Assuming the Company exercises its purchase options for the Bellevue hotel in
December 2003 and the Yakima hotel in September 2003, total payments due under
all of the Company leases at December 31, 2002 are as follows in thousands     Years Ending
December 31        2003            $  7,113

16. Employee Benefit and Stock Plans
1998 Stock Incentive Plan
The 1998 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors
in 1998. The Plan authorizes the grant or issuance of various option or other
awards. The Company amended the Plan in 2000 to increase the maximum number of
shares which may be awarded under the Plan from 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 shares,
subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and similar events. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the Plan and
establishes to whom, the type and the terms and conditions, including the
exercise period, the awards are granted.
Nonqualified stock options may be granted for any term specified by the
Compensation Committee and may be granted at less than fair market value, but
not less than par value on the date of grant. Incentive stock options may be
granted only to employees and must be granted at an exercise price at least
equal to fair market value on the date of grant and have a ten year exercise
period. The maximum fair market value of shares which may be issued pursuant to
incentive stock options granted under the Plan to any individual in any calendar
year may not exceed $100,000. Stock Appreciation Rights SARs may also be
granted in connection with stock options or other awards. SARs typically will
provide for payments to the holder based upon increases in the price of the
common stock over the exercise price of the related option or award, but
alternatively may be based upon other criteria such as book value. Other awards
such as restricted stock awards, dividend equivalent awards, performance awards
or deferred stock awards may also be granted under the Plan by the Compensation
Committee.
All options granted have been designated as nonqualified options, with an
exercise price equal to or in excess of fair market value on the date of grant
and for a term of ten years. For substantially all options granted, fifty
percent of each recipients' options will vest on the fourth anniversary of the
date of grant and the remaining 50% will vest on the fifth anniversary of the
date of grant. The vesting schedule will change if, beginning one year after the
option grant date, the stock price of the common stock reaches the following
target levels measured as a percentage increase over the exercise price for 60
consecutive trading days    Stock Price        Percent of Option

December 31, 2002 and 2001, options totaling 40,773 and 27,000 respectively are
exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of $1500.
In July 2002, the Company offered eligible option holders the opportunity to
exchange certain options for new options. The new options offered were issued at
fair market value of the stock on or after the first business day that is six
months and one day after the date the original options were cancelled in the

of the offer. In February 2003, the Company granted 261,251 new non-qualified
options. There was no impact on the Company financial condition and results of
operations in 2002 as a result of this transaction.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model with the  following  weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000                         2002    2001    2000

The weighted-average life of options outstanding at December 31, 2002 was 783
years. The weighted-average fair value of all options granted during 2002, 2001
and 2000 was  $217,  $137  and $412 per  share,  respectively.  The
weighted-average fair value and exercise price for options granted at market
value and for those options granted above market value on the date of grant in

also granted 55,000 restricted shares of common stock to certain members of
senior management. Twenty percent of these shares were issued in 1998 and 1999.
Twenty percent were to be issued in each subsequent year provided such employee
was an employee of the Company at that time. Management stock grants in 2002,
2001 and 2000 were canceled and paid in cash. The Company recorded compensation
expense of approximately $80,000, $56,000 and $55,000 during the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, associated with these grants.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 1998, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to assist
employees of the Company in acquiring a stock ownership interest in the Company.
A maximum of 300,000 shares of common stock is reserved for issuance under this
plan. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase
common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. No employee may purchase
more than $25,000 worth of common stock under this plan in any calendar year.
During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, 19,902, 24,139 and
26,429 shares were purchased under this plan for approximately $102,000 107,000 and $175,000, respectively.

Amended and Restated Retirement and Savings Plan. The defined contribution plan
was created for the benefit of substantially all employees of the Company. The
Company makes contributions of up to 3% of an employee compensation based on a
vesting schedule and eligibility requirements set forth in the plan document.
Company contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 were approximately $435,000, $225,000 and $240,000, respectively.
17. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available
market  information  and  appropriate  valuation  methodologies.  However,
considerable judgment is required to interpret market data and to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current
market exchange.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value. Potential income tax ramifications related to the realization of
unrealized gains and losses that would be incurred in an actual sale or
settlement have not been taken into consideration.
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, current
liabilities and variable rate long-term debt are reasonable estimates of their
fair values. The fair values of fixed-rate long-term debt and capital lease
obligations are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The
discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for debt or capital
lease obligations with similar remaining maturities.
