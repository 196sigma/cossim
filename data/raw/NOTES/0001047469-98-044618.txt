NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY:
GaSonics International Corporation the Company is a leading global
supplier of products and services used in the fabrication of advanced integrated
circuits semiconductors or ICs and flat panel displays FPDs. The
Company markets its products in the United States, Europe, and the Asia Pacific
region primarily to large semiconductor and liquid crystal manufacturing
concerns. The Company is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited
to, volatility in the semiconductor markets and the related demand for
semiconductor equipment and the risk of inventory obsolescence resulting from
new product developments by competitors.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and branches after
elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially
from those estimates.
FISCAL YEAR. The Company maintains a fifty-two/fifty-three week fiscal year
cycle ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Fiscal 1998, fiscal 1997
and fiscal 1996 contain fifty-two weeks. For external reporting purposes, the
Company indicates its fiscal period as ending on September 30.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash paid for interest, including amounts paid under capital lease
obligations, and domestic and foreign income taxes was as follows in
thousands:
YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
1998    1997    1996
$   25 $   94 $   41
Income  $   224 $   625 $  6,188
The Company had one significant non-cash transaction for the year ended
September 30, 1997 related to the Submicron Technologies PLC see Concentration
of Credit Risk below write-off of their uncollectible account. Non-cash
activity included a before tax bad debt expense of $45 million.
INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES. Pursuant to the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, the Company investments
are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Material
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of
stockholders' equity, net of tax. The Company investments in debt securities
mature at various dates through December 2000.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
The fair value of available-for-sale securities was determined based on
quoted market prices at the reporting date for the instruments.
The components of available-for-sale securities by major security type as of
September 30, 1998 and 1997 are as follows in thousands:
GROSS
UNREALIZED
AMORTIZED  AGGREGATE   HOLDING
COST   FAIR VALUE   GAINS
FISCAL 1998
Debt securities issued by states of the United States and
political subdivisions of the states.  $ 25,774  $ 25,774  $    
FISCAL 1997
Debt securities issued by states of the United States and
political subdivisions of the states.  $ 15,750  $ 15,750  $    
Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities were approximately
$611 million, $273 million and $685 million in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. Gross realized gains on those sales were approximately $8,000 3,000 and $22,000 in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company used
specific identification as the cost basis in computing realized gains. Any
material net unrealized holding gain, net of applicable tax effect, on
available-for-sale securities has been included as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.
REVENUE RECOGNITION AND PRODUCT WARRANTY. Revenues from the Company
products are generally recognized upon shipment. The Company provides for the
estimated costs of installation and warranty at the time revenue is recognized.
Maintenance and service revenues account for less than 10% of net sales and are
recognized as the related work is performed.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS. One customer accounted for approximately 20%, 10% and 11%
of net sales for each of fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Two
other customers each accounted for approximately 11% of net sales in fiscal
1997. There was one other customer in fiscal 1998 that accounted for
approximately 11% of net sales.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS. SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires the
capitalization of certain computer software development costs incurred after
technological feasibility is established. Amounts qualifying for capitalization
under the statement are immaterial and have not been capitalized to date.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out or market and include material, labor and manufacturing costs.
Inventory is valued at currently adjusted standards which approximate actual
costs on a first-in, first-out basis.
The Company provides inventory reserves for excess, obsolete, damaged or
lost inventory. The process of estimating required inventory reserves is
judgmental and is based on a number of factors which require input and
discussion among various members of management. Such factors include changes in
customer demand, changes in technology and other economic factors.

2,254   6,809
Finished    6,021   6,347
$ 20,822 $ 27,075
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment are stated at cost and are
generally depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets four to ten
years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the
remaining lease term. Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded at the
present value of the related lease obligations and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the related lease term.
OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES. Other accrued liabilities included the following
in thousands:

3,661   3,614
$ 11,423 $ 12,886
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE. Net income loss per share data has been
computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
for the Basic net income loss per share calculation, and using the weighted
average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalent shares
calculated under the treasury stock method for the Diluted net income loss per
share calculation.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The functional currency of the Company
foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, foreign translation and
exchange gains and losses, which have not been material, are reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of
temporary cash investments and trade receivables. The Company has cash
investment policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution evaluated as highly creditworthy. Concentration of credit
risk with respect to trade receivables exists because the Company revenues are
derived primarily from the sale of photoresist removal equipment to companies in
the semiconductor industry. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers and generally does not require collateral.
A write-off of accounts receivable was recorded in the third quarter of
fiscal 1997 for the uncollectible account receivable due from SubMicron
Technologies PLC in Thailand. The Company recorded a $45 million pre-tax charge
to cover the unpaid balance on accounts receivable, less the value of the
recovered equipment, which the Company has resold during fiscal 1998.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.
EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In February 1997, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 129, Disclosure of Information about
Capital Structures, which will be adopted by the Company in the first quarter
of fiscal 1999. SFAS No129 requires companies to disclose certain information
about their capital structure. The adoption of SFAS No. 129 is not anticipated
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statement disclosures of
the Company.
In June 1997, The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income, and SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information both of which will be adopted by the
Company in fiscal 1999. SFAS No. 130 requires companies to disclose certain
information regarding the nature and amounts of comprehensive income included in
the financial statements. SFAS No. 131 requires companies to disclose certain
information about operating segments within their business. The Company does not
anticipate that the adoption of SFAS No. 130, or SFAS No. 131, will have a
material impact on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.

The Company operations are structured to achieve consolidated objectives.
As a result, significant interdependencies and overlaps exist among the
Company operating units. Accordingly, the revenue, operating income loss and
identifiable assets shown for each geographic area may not be indicative of the
amounts that would have been reported if the operating units were independent of
one another.
Intercompany sales between areas are accounted for based on established
intercompany sales prices.
Operating income loss is revenue less related costs and direct and
allocated operating expenses, excluding interest and, for all areas except the
United States, the unallocated portion of corporate expenses. United States
operating income is net of corporate engineering and development and
administrative expenses.
Corporate assets include assets maintained for general purposes, principally
cash equivalents and marketable securities.
4. CHARGES TAKEN DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
The twelve month period ended September 30, 1998 included pre-tax charges of
approximately $17 million, related to costs of reductions in force completed in
June 1998 and September 1998 and costs of facility consolidations. As of
September 30, 1998, $946,000 of the $17 million has been paid and $754,000
remains on the Company books as an accrual. Also included in the twelve month
period ended September 30, 1998 are pre-tax charges of approximately $40
million, related primarily to reserves for potential excess inventory and
accelerated write-downs of certain demonstration equipment.

5. RECONCILIATION OF EARNINGS AND SHARE AMOUNTS USED IN EPS CALCULATION
Effective December 31, 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings per
Share. Basic earnings loss per common share were computed by dividing net
income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during this period. Diluted earnings loss per common share for the
twelve months ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, were calculated using the

As a result, the Company reported earnings per share for fiscal years 1997 and

6. LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT AND CREDIT FACILITY:
The Company has an unsecured $20,000,000 revolving line of credit agreement
the Agreement with Union Bank which expires on March 31, 1999. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the Agreement as of September 30, 1998. Under the
line of credit, all borrowings bear interest at the bank LIBOR rate plus 125%
per annum. The line of credit agreement contains certain covenants, including
covenants relating to financial ratios, profitability and tangible net worth
which must be maintained by the Company. The Company was not in compliance with
the line of credit profitability covenant as of June 30, 1998 as a result of the
Company loss for the period. However, in July 1998 Union Bank waived the
Company non-compliance for such period and amended the Loan Agreement to
provide for the payment by the Company of a commitment fee on the averaged
unused portion of the credit line for the preceding quarter in the amount of
15% per annum and to amend the profitability covenant to provide that the
Company may not incur a net loss exceeding $50 million through December 31,
1998. After such time, the Company must maintain a net profit to avoid violating
the covenant. The Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of the
amended Agreement as of September 30, 1998.
Under the Agreement, the Company has a provision for foreign exchange
contracts of up to $10 million, and may also request standby letters of credit
not to exceed $500,000. As of September 30, 1998, there were letters of credit
outstanding in the amount of $69,163.
The Company wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan, GaSonics International
Japan, K.K. entered into an agreement with the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi to
secure a credit facility to provide operating capital to fund operations. The
credit facility provides for borrowings up to a maximum of 300 million Japanese
yen equivalent to approximately $21 million in U.S. dollars as of September
30, 1998, and is secured by a Letter of Guarantee issued by the Company. The
outstanding balance bears interest at 1625% per annum and is due and payable on
demand. This credit facility expires on March 31, 1999. At September 30, 1998,
borrowings under this credit facility agreement were 296 million Japanese yen,
which is equivalent to approximately $21 million U.S. dollars as of that date.
The Company intends to enter into a new agreement or extend the term of the
existing credit facility prior to the due date; however, there can be assurance
that such financing will be available when required or, will be on reasonable
terms.

The Company lease agreement for one of its facilities provides for the
deferral of three months cash rental payments in fiscal 1990 and subsequent
scheduled rent increases. Rent expense under this agreement is being recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference between the
amounts paid and the amounts expensed is classified as deferred rent in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
No new capital lease obligations were incurred in fiscal 1998 or 1997.
10. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN:
In November 1993, the Company then President and Chief Executive Officer
the President exercised options to purchase an aggregate of 566,665 shares
of common stock at $060 per share, with a 5% interest bearing promissory note
payable to the Company in the amount of $340,000. In January 1994, the Board of
Directors authorized a special bonus program for the President, pursuant to
which $100,000 of the principal of the promissory note would be forgiven upon
his completion of each calendar year of service to the Company from January 1,
1994 through January 1, 1997. Accordingly, the promissory note has been
amortized to compensation expense in the amounts of $65,000 for fiscal 1997 and
$100,000 in fiscal years 1996 and 1995, respectively. The promissory note was
fully amortized at September 30, 1997.
1994 STOCK OPTION/STOCK ISSUANCE PLAN. In fiscal 1994, the Board adopted,
and the stockholders subsequently approved, the 1994 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan the 1994 Stock Option Plan and
45
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998
10. INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN: CONTINUED
authorized a total of 1,450,000 shares for issuance under the Plan. The 1994
Stock Option Plan replaced the Company 1985 Stock Option Plan and the
Company 1988 Stock Option Plan which have both been terminated. During fiscal
years 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company Board of Directors authorized, and the
stockholders subsequently approved, an additional 400,000, 500,000 and 750,000
shares, respectively, for issuance under the Plan.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan is divided into three separate components: i
the Discretionary Option Grant Program under which key employees including
officers and directors and consultants may, at the discretion of the Plan
Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of common stock at an
exercise price not less than 85% of the fair market value of such shares on the
grant date, ii the Automatic Option Grant Program under which option grants
will automatically be made at periodic intervals to the nonemployee Board
members to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to 100% of
the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date, and iii the
Stock Issuance Program under which key employees including officers and
directors and consultants may be issued shares of common stock directly, either
through the purchase of such shares at a price not less than 85% of their fair
market value at the time of issuance or as a bonus tied to the performance of
services or the Company attainment of financial objectives. In no event may
the aggregate number of shares of common stock for which any individual
participating in the 1994 Plan may be granted stock options and direct stock
issuances exceed 825,000 shares over the term of the Plan. Options granted under
the Discretionary and Automatic Option Grant Programs have a maximum term of ten
years and generally vest over periods of one to five years from the date of
grant, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator. There were no stock
issuances under the 1994 Stock Option Plan in fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996.
In August 1996, holders of the Company options were given the opportunity
to exchange previously granted stock options for new common stock options.
Option holders, excluding non-employee directors of the Company, who held an
outstanding stock option with an exercise price in excess of $725 per share
were granted a new option with an exercise price of $725 per share, the market
price of the common stock on that date, in exchange for his or her higher-priced
option. Each optionee was given the choice of accepting the new option with a
new four year vesting schedule and having the higher-priced option canceled or
rejecting the new option and retaining the higher-priced option with its
original vesting schedule. Under the terms of the new options, one-quarter of
the shares vest one year from the date of grant and the remaining shares vest in
36 monthly installments. Options to purchase 416,725 shares were so exchanged.
In November 1998, holders of the Company options were given the
opportunity to exchange previously granted stock options for new common stock
options. Option holders, excluding non-employee directors of the Company, who
held an outstanding stock option with an exercise price in excess of $5625 per
share were granted a new option with an exercise price of $5625 per share, the
market price of the common stock on that date, in exchange for his or her
higher-priced option. Each optionee was given the choice of accepting the new
option with a new four year vesting schedule and having the higher-priced option
canceled or rejecting the new option and retaining the higher-priced option with
its original vesting schedule. Under the terms of the new options, one-quarter
of the shares vest one year from the date of grant and the remaining shares vest
in 36 monthly installments. Options to purchase 960,131 shares were so
exchanged.

purchase shares of common stock, at semi-annual intervals, through their
periodic payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan. The Company had initially
reserved 300,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan.
The Company Board of Directors authorized, and the stockholders subsequently
approved, an additional 400,000 shares of Common Stock under the Purchase Plan
in each of fiscal years 1998, 1997 and 1996.
Participants in the Purchase Plan may purchase shares at 85% of the lower of
i the fair market value of the common stock on the participant entry date
into the offering period or ii the fair market value on the semi-annual
purchase date. The Purchase Plan will in all events terminate on December 31,
2003.
Of the 1,100,000 shares reserved for the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
654,482 shares were purchased as of September 30, 1998.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. In October 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
which establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
compensation plans and requires additional disclosures for those companies who
elect not to adopt the new method of accounting. The Company adopted SFAS No.
123 in fiscal 1997, and in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the
Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock option and stock purchase plans.
The Company stock plans, as described above, are accounted for under APB
Opinion No. 25. Because the FASB Statement No. 123 method of accounting has not
been applied to options granted prior to October 1, 1995, the resulting pro
forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in
future years. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent
with Statement No. 123, the Company consolidated net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts:

Net income loss--as  $ 5,713 $  3,007 $  8,930

Earnings loss per share--Basic--pro  $  055 $  010 $  057
Earnings loss per share--Diluted--pro  $  055 $  009 $  056
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To GaSonics International Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GaSonics
International Corporation a Delaware Corporation and subsidiaries as of
September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 1998. These financial statements and the
schedules referred to below are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of GaSonics International
Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the results
of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index under item
14a2 is the responsibility of the Company management and is presented for
purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is
not part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements
and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.
