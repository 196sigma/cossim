27               THE NORTH FACE, INC.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999, 1998 AND 1997
1. Business and Basis of Presentation
The North Face, Inc. designs and distributes technically sophisticated
outerwear, snowsports gear, functional sportswear, tents, sleeping bags,
backpacks, daypacks, accessories and rugged footwear under The North FaceR
name. Through its subsidiary, La SportivaR USA, the Company distributes rock
climbing shoes, mountaineering boots and other rugged footwear under the La
Sportiva name. The Company sells its products to select specialty retailers
throughout the United States, Europe and Canada. As of December 31, 1999 the
Company also operated 8 retail stores and 15 outlets.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the financial
statements, during the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company incurred net
losses of $1005 million, and, as of that date, the Company current
liabilities exceeded its current assets by $100 million. These factors, among
others, raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to continue as a
going concern.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should be Company be
unable to continue as a going concern. As described in Note 10, the Company
bank credit facility expires on April 15, 2000; therefore, the outstanding loan
$855 million has been classified as a current liability. In April 2000, the
Company executed a definitive merger agreement the VF Merger Agreement
providing for the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of the Company by VF
Corporation VF for $200 per share. As a first step in the transaction, a
subsidiary of VF will commence a cash tender offer for all the outstanding
shares of the Company at $200 per share. The offer will be conditioned, among
other things, upon a majority of the issued and outstanding shares being
tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer. Following
successful completion of the tender offer, the VF subsidiary will be merged into
The North Face and each outstanding share will be converted into the right to
receive $200 in cash.
The Company difficulties in meeting its loan agreement covenants and
financing needs, its losses from operations, its negative working capital
position and the scheduled expiration of its credit facility on April 15, 2000
have raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
As a consequence, if, for any reason, the tender offer and merger contemplated
by the VF Merger Agreement are not consummated, the Company will be required to
consider seeking protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the financial statements of The North Face, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation. The assets and liabilities of the Company
foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange
rates in effect at period end, and the revenues and expenses have been
translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates in effect during
the period. Adjustments resulting from translating foreign financial statements
into U.S. dollars are reported as translation adjustments as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Aggregate transaction losses for 1999, 1998
and 1997 were $927,000, $192,000 and $698,000, respectively.
Cash Equivalents represent short-term investments with original maturities of
less than three months.
28  Accounts Receivable from wholesale customers are recorded upon the sale of
inventory to independent retailers and distributors net of a provision for
estimated returns. A sale occurs when inventories are shipped and title and risk
of loss have transferred from the Company to the buyer. Seasonal goods are
generally shipped to retailers prior to the selling season. The Company offers
extended payment terms for preseason orders.
Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market. The Company
principally contracts for the manufacture of its products in the U.S., Asia and
Europe. Costs related to these inventories represent landed cost, which consists
of the price paid to third party manufacturers and inbound duties and freight.
Trademarks and Intangibles consist primarily of trademarks and goodwill and
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over forty years. The Company
assesses impairment of long-lived assets on a periodic basis in accordance with
SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1999 and
1998 was approximately $46 million and $36 million, respectively. Amortization
expense was $940,000, $860,000 and $785,000 for the years ended December 31,
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company
recognized impairment in the amount of $227 million in order to state the value
of Company equity consistent with the purchase price proposed under the VF
Merger Agreement. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company
recognized impairment in the amount of $29 million because of management
decision to sell La Sportiva S.p.A. and La Sportiva USA. The fair value of the
impaired assets were recorded based on the estimated sales price of these
businesses.
Property and Equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is
computed using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated useful life
of the asset or over the remaining lease term, if shorter, for capital leases.
The estimated useful lives of certain categories are as follows  Leasehold improvements           5 - 10 years
Machinery and equipment             5 years
Furniture, fixtures and office equipment  3 - 7 years
Expenditures for replacements and improvements are capitalized; maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Investment in La Sportiva S.p.A. The Company accounts for its 20% interest in
La Sportiva S.p.A. using the equity method and the investment is included in
other assets in the accompanying balance sheet. See Note 3.
Product Warranty. Substantially all of the Company products, except
footwear, carry a lifetime warranty for defects in quality and workmanship which
allows the Company to repair or replace, at its option, the products found to
have a manufacturing defect. The Company maintains warranty departments in the
U.S., Canada and Europe and repairs or replaces items returned under warranty.
The Company estimated liability for future warranty claims related to past
sales at December 31, 1999, and 1998 is approximately $56 million and $41
million, respectively, of which the non-current portion of $45 million and $30
million is classified as other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 1999 and
1998, respectively. The current portion of the warranty liability is $11
million and $11 million and is classified as other current liabilities as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Warranty expense was approximately
$1,771,000, $1,504,000 and $1,496,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
Deferred Rent. Certain of the Company operating leases contain
predetermined fixed increases of the minimum rental rate during the initial
lease term. For these leases, the Company recognizes the related rental expense
on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease and records the difference
between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as deferred rent.
Income Taxes. The Company applies an asset and liability approach that
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company
financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the
Company generally considers all expected future events other than enactment of
changes in the tax laws or rates. Deferred taxes are provided for temporary
differences between assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
for income tax purposes and valuation allowances are recorded against net
deferred tax assets where appropriate. No U.S. income tax provisions
29 have been provided on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign
operations as it is the Company intention to utilize those earnings in those
foreign operations for an indefinite period of time.
Minority Interest. Minority interest represents redeemable preferred stock of
La Sportiva USA owned by the majority shareholders of La Sportiva S.p.A. The
redeemable preferred stock has a 1% cumulative dividend and is redeemable in
minimum increments of $50,000 per year.
Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the
diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur upon exercise of
outstanding stock options. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 1999
exclude any effect of all stock options because their inclusion would be
antidilutive. The following is a summary of the calculation of the number of
shares used in calculating basic and diluted EPS in thousands                    Years Ended December 31,
1999   1998   1997

Stock-Based Compensation. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation SFAS No. 123, allows either
adoption of a fair value method for accounting for stock-based compensation
plans or continuation of accounting under Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee, and related
interpretations with supplemental disclosures. The Company has chosen to account
for its stock options using the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB
Opinion No. 25 and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation expense for
stock option grants made at an exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair
market value of the stock at the date of grant. Pro forma net income and
earnings per share amounts as if the fair value method had been adopted are
presented in Note 13. SFAS No. 123 does not impact the Company results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.
Derivatives. Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts used to
hedge foreign currency denominated receivables are recognized currently. Gains
and losses related to qualifying hedges of preseason orders which are
considered firm commitments are deferred and recognized in income when the
hedged transaction occurs.
Comprehensive Income Loss. In the first quarter of 1998, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which established
standards for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components
in financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as net income and all
non-owner changes in stockholders' equity. Accumulated other comprehensive
income consists entirely of foreign currency translation adjustments and is
presented in the statement of shareholders equity.
Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments. SFAS No. 107, Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the estimated
fair value of financial instruments. The carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates their
estimated fair values due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The
carrying value of the Company debt approximates its estimated fair value based
on interest rates available to the Company and debt instruments with similar
terms.
30  Segment Data. During the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company adopted
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information SFAS 131. SFAS 131 supersedes SFAS 14, Financial Reporting for
Segments of a Business Enterprise, replacing the industry segment approach
with the management approach. The management approach designates the internal
reporting that is used by management for making operating decisions and
assessing performance as the source of the Company reportable segments. SFAS
131 also requires disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and
major customers. The adoption of SFAS 131 did not affect results of operations
or the financial position of the Company but did affect the disclosure of
segment information.
New Accounting Pronouncement. In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. The
statement requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments
at fair value. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2000 and is not to be applied retroactively to financial statements for
prior periods. Management has not assessed the impact of the adoption of SFAS
No. 133.
Reclassifications. Certain amounts in the 1998 and 1997 financial statements
have been reclassified to conform with the 1999 presentation. Such
reclassifications had no effect on earnings.
3. Investments in La Sportiva Businesses
On July 2, 1998, the Company acquired a 20% interest in La Sportiva S.r.l., a
premier manufacturer and distributor of trekking, mountaineering, and climbing
footwear located in Ziano di Fiemme, Italy for a purchase price of $25 million,
and incurred direct costs of approximately $06 million, for a total purchase
price of approximately $31 million. In August 1998, La Sportiva S.r.l. changed
its name to La Sportiva S.p.A. The majority shareholders of La Sportiva S.p.A.
have a put option which may require the Company to purchase, in a single
transaction, an additional 31% interest in La Sportiva S.p.A. for 68 billion
lira $35 million at December 31, 1999. This put option may be exercised at
any time during the period beginning on July 1, 2000 and ending on July 1, 2003.
After the expiration of the put option and until December 31, 2004, the
Company may exercise a call option which, if exercised, would require the
majority shareholders of La Sportiva S.p.A. to sell an additional 31% interest
to the Company for 68 billion lira $35 million at December 31, 1999. The
Company has accounted for its 20% interest in La Sportiva S.p.A. under the
equity method. The purchase price of La Sportiva S.p.A. exceeded the Company
proportionate share of the net assets acquired by $24 million, which was
recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight line basis over 40
years.
In October 1998, the Company entered into a foreign exchange contract, whereby
it hedged the potential future payment of the put and call options of 68
billion lira $35 million at December 31, 1999. In connection with that
transaction, the Company recorded a $583,000 and $231,000 foreign exchange loss

and was initially amortized on a straight line basis over 40 years. The
acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting. The Company
has consolidated the results of La Sportiva USA beginning on July 2, 1998.
On January 13, 2000, the Company sold its 20% interest in La Sportiva S.p.A.

The term note facility calls for $075 million to be repaid quarterly
beginning on October 1, 1999 with the outstanding principal balance due and
payable on the termination date of the loan agreement. The revolving line of
credit provides for borrowings up to $1150 million until December 31, 1999, and

on the revolving line of credit carried interest payable monthly at a rate of
either 1 the prime rate which is the higher of a the bank base commercial
lending rate minus 50% or b 50 above the federal funds effective rate plus
the applicable margin, or 2 LIBOR plus the applicable margin, at the option of
the Company. In November 1999, the Company interest rates were amended to the
bank base commercial lending rate plus 20% during any period in which the
Company utilizes a special inventory advance rate in the calculation of the
collateral. At December 31, 1999, the Company interest rate was 1075% on the
revolving line of credit and the term loan.
Fees for outstanding letters of credit are payable at 15% per annum. The
Company also pays a monthly unused line fee on the revolving line of credit at
375% per annum. The Company was charged an amendment fee of $400,000 in
November 1999 and paid an additional $575,000 extension fee in December 1999 as
the bank credit facility was not repaid in full by December 31, 1999. Also, the
Company issued the lender 202,597 warrants to purchase the Company common
stock at an exercise price of $48125 which became exercisable beginning on
January 15, 2000,as the bank credit facility was not repaid in full by that
date.
In February 2000, the Company bank credit facility was amended to increase
the borrowing limit to the available collateral plus $160 million and to
reflect certain changes in the financial and reporting covenants, among other
things. In addition, the interest rate increased by 05% under this amendment.
The Company was charged an amendment fee of
37 10 million which was paid upon the signing of the amendment and a deferred fee
of $35 million, which was payable on the earlier of 1 the sale of at least
51% of the outstanding shares or assets of the Company or 2 June 15, 2000. In
April 2000, the Company and the lender signed a waiver and agreement reducing
the deferred fee from $35 million to $876,000 for the transactions contemplated
by the VF Merger Agreement.

12. Commitments and Contingencies
On February 27, 1999, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement the
Transaction Agreement with TNF Acquisition LLC TNF, an affiliate of
Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. LGP. The Transaction Agreement
38 provided for a tender offer for all the Company outstanding stock other than
shares held by James G. Fifield, former President and Chief Executive Officer
at $1700 cash per share and the acquisition of control of the Company by LGP
and Mr. Fifield. On March 5, 1999, the Company withdrew its tender offer. The
Transaction Agreement remained in full force and effect, although LGP had
informed the Company that it was reevaluating the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Agreement the Transactions. On September 1, 1999, the
Transaction Agreement was terminated and the Company agreed to pay LGP $22
million to reimburse LGP for expenses associated with the terminated Transaction
Agreement.
In March 1999, various complaints were filed against the Company and its Board
of Directors in the Delaware court of Chancery and in the California Superior
Court, Alameda County in connection with the Transactions. The complaints, filed
on behalf of a purported class of the Company shareholders, generally alleged
that the Transactions were unfair and inadequate to the Company shareholders
and charged the defendants with self-dealing and breach of fiduciary duties. The
complaints generally requested injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of
the Transactions, and sought other remedies in the event the Transactions were
completed. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss these claims.
Beginning in March 1999, purported class action lawsuits were filed in federal
district court against the Company and certain of its former and current
officers and directors alleging violations of the federal securities laws. These
complaints collectively, the Securities Litigation have been consolidated in
federal district court in Colorado. The consolidated action generally alleges
that the Company made false and misleading statements about its financial
results from January 22, 1998 through April 16, 1999. The Company has filed a
motion to dismiss these claims.
On April 6, 1999, a shareholder derivative action purportedly on behalf of the
Company, captioned Eng v. Cason, et. al., Civil Action No. 810726-0, was filed
in California Superior Court, Alameda County. The complaint alleged that the
Company directors and various current and former officers violated California
law and breached fiduciary duties to the Company by engaging in alleged wrongful
conduct from April 25, 1997 through March 12, 1999, including the conduct
complained of in the Securities Litigation. The Company was named solely as a
nominal defendant, against whom the plaintiff sought no recovery. The Alameda
Superior Court granted the Company motion to dismiss the derivative complaint
with leave to amend.
In December 1999, a case, FDX Supply Chain Services, Inc. v. The North Face,
Inc., No. 99-2569, was filed in federal district court in the district of
Kansas. The dispute arises out of contract in which FDX agreed to provide
warehouse services to the Company, fill orders and ship the Company products
to customers nationwide from the Company warehouse facility in Lenexa, Kansas.
The Company terminated the contract in December 1999. The lawsuit alleges
damages of $52 million for breach of contract. The Company has filed
counterclaims seeking $25 million in damages, alleging that the damage
limitation provisions of the agreement should not apply because of FDX
misrepresentations inducing the Company to enter into the agreement and FDX
gross failure to perform. FDX has moved to dismiss all the Company
counterclaims because of, inter alia, the damage limitation provisions of the
agreement.
Income Taxes. The Internal Revenue Service IRS is presently examining the
Company Federal tax returns for the taxable years ended December 31, 1994
through 1996. The IRS is also examining intercompany transfer prices. The
outcome of these examinations and any related liabilities, if any, cannot
presently be determined. The Company has made no provision for any liability
that might result, as management is of the opinion that the Company will not
sustain any significant adjustments as a result of these examinations.
Purchase Commitments. The Company has approximately $574 million and $462
million of purchase commitments as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
related to goods ordered for future production in the normal course of business.
Certain of these commitments are collateralized by outstanding letters of
credit. See Note 10.
39  Derivatives. The Company international subsidiaries sell merchandise
throughout Europe and Canada. These sales are denominated in the local currency
of the retailer country. Additionally, certain of the purchases of the
Company international subsidiaries are denominated in U.S. dollars. To protect
the Company from the risk that the eventual net cash inflows resulting from the
sale of products to foreign customers will be adversely affected by changes in
exchange rates, the Company subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts
and options hedging instruments to hedge their foreign denominated accounts
receivable, matched firm orders and anticipated orders. At December 31, 1999,
the Company held the following foreign currency derivatives, all of which expire

40  1994 Stock Incentive Plan. In 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Stock
Incentive Plan the 1994 Plan to issue non-qualified stock options NQSOs
to purchase shares of common stock. All NQSOs were granted at an exercise price
that was, at the time of grant, an amount equal to the fair market value of a

1,159,950 restricted shares of common stock were granted under the 1994 Plan
pursuant to the payment of cash and delivery of promissory notes totaling

the 1995 Plan was adopted by the Company in April 1995, and the Company
1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan was adopted by the Company in May

ratified by shareholders to increase the number of shares of common stock
reserved for issuance by 600,000 shares. The Company currently does not
anticipate making additional grants under the 1995 Plan.

Pro Forma Stock Option Information. The Company accounts for its stock- based
awards using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting For Stock Issued To
42 Employees and its related interpretations. No compensation cost has been
recognized in the financial statements for employee stock arrangements.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans been
recorded in accordance with the fair value method of SFAS 123, the Company net
income loss and net income loss per share for 1999, 1998 and 1997 would
approximate the following pro forma amounts in thousands, except per share
data                      1999    1998  1997
Net income loss:
As reported               $100,481 $3,592 $7,955
Pro forma                105,007  1,442  6,957
Diluted net income loss per share:

Pro forma                  866 $ 013 $ 061
For purposes of computing the above pro forma amounts, the fair value of each
option granted during 1999, 1998, and 1997 was estimated as of the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires subjective
assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected date of
exercise, which greatly affects the calculated values. The following weighted
average assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of the options
granted: i dividend yield of 0% for 1999, 1998 and 1997; ii expected
volatility of 855% for 1999, 785% for 1998, and 586% for 1997; iii risk-
free interest rate of 601%, 532% and 656% for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively; and iv expected life from vesting to exercise of 6 months for
1999, 1998 and 1997. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
The effects of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure may not be
indicative of future pro forma amounts, because the fair value method has not
been applied to awards granted prior to 1995.

In February 2000, the Company bank credit facility was amended to increase
the borrowing limit to the available collateral plus $160 million and to
reflect certain changes in the financial and reporting covenants, among other
things. In addition, the interest rate increased by 05% under this amendment.
The Company was charged an amendment fee of $10 million which was paid upon the
signing of the amendment and a deferred fee of $35 million which is payable on
the earlier of 1 the sale of at least 51% of the outstanding shares or assets
of the Company or 2 June 15, 2000. In April 2000, the Company and the lender
signed a waiver and agreement reducing the deferred fee from $35 million to
$876,000.
In March 2000, the Company bank credit facility expiration date was extended
from March 31, 2000 to April 15, 2000.
In April 2000, the Company executed the VF Merger Agreement providing for the
acquisition of all the outstanding shares of the Company by VF for $200 per
share. As a first step in the transaction, a subsidiary of VF will commence a
cash tender offer for all the outstanding shares of the Company at $200 per
share. The offer will be conditioned, among other things, upon a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares being tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
expiration of the offer. Following successful completion of the tender offer,
the VF subsidiary will be merged into The North Face and each outstanding share
will be converted into the right to receive $200 in cash.
The Company difficulties in meeting its loan agreement covenants and
financing needs, its losses from operations, its negative working capital
position and the scheduled expiration of its credit facility on April 15, 2000
have raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
As a consequence, if, for any reason, the tender offer and merger contemplated
by the VF Merger Agreement are not consummated, the Company will be required to
consider seeking protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.
On January 13, 2000 the Company sold its 20% interest in La Sportiva S.p.A. to
the majority shareholders for 43 billion lira $23 million.
In February 2000, the Company closed its Carbondale, Colorado administrative
facility and relocated those employees to its headquarters facility in San
Leandro, California. The Company expects to incur approximately $26 million in
2000 in operating expenses related to the closure of its Carbondale, Colorado
facility and the relocation of its employees to its San Leandro facility.
45             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and the Stockholders of The North Face, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The North Face,
Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of The North Face Europe
Limited a consolidated subsidiary, which statements reflect total assets
constituting 21% and 16% respectively, of consolidated total assets as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and total revenues constituting 21%, 19%, and 20 respectively, of consolidated total revenues for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999. Those statements were audited by other auditors
whose reports which include an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial
doubt about The North Face Europe Limited ability to continue as a going
concern have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to
the amounts included for The North Face Europe Limited, is based solely on the
reports of such other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, the financial position of The
North Face, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the
financial statements, the Company 1999 loss, negative working capital at
December 31, 1999, and the expiration of its bank credit facility on April 15,
2000 raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Management plans in regard to these matters are also discussed in Note 1. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

all material aspects, the consolidated financial position of The North Face
Europe Limited and its subsidiary as of December 31, 1999 and their
consolidated results of operations for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the

financial statements, The North Face Inc. the parent company will recognise a
significant loss in 1999, has negative working capital at December 31, 1999 and

statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of
this uncertainty.
United Kingdom accounting principles vary in certain material respects from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The application
of the latter would have affected the determination of consolidated

and the determination of consolidated net income for the year then ended to the
extent summarized in Notes 23 and 24 to the consolidated financial statement of
