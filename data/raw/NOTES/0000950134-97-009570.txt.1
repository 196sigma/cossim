REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Billing Information Concepts Corp.     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Billing
Information Concepts Corp. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
September 30, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Billing Information
Concepts Corp. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1997 and 1996, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

BILLING INFORMATION CONCEPTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
NOTE 1. BUSINESS ACTIVITY
Billing Information Concepts Corp. BIC was incorporated in the
State of Delaware in 1996. BIC was previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S.
Long Distance Corp. USLD that, upon its spin-off from USLD, became an
independent, publicly held company. BIC and its subsidiaries collectively, the
Company primarily provide billing clearinghouse and information management
services in the United States to the telecommunications industry. In addition
to processing call records, the Company provides a wide range of back office
services including customer service, data processing, tax filings, accounting
services and an advance funding program. The Company also develops, licenses
and supports billing systems for telecommunications service providers and
provides direct billing services.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of BIC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
On August 2, 1996 the Distribution Date, USLD distributed all of
the outstanding common stock of BIC, pro rata to the stockholders of USLD the
Distribution with the result being that BIC became an independent, publicly
held company that owns and operates all of the assets of, and is responsible
for all of the liabilities associated with, the billing clearinghouse and
information management services business previously owned by USLD. The
accompanying financial statements include the operations of BIC which, until
the Distribution, were combined with and reported as part of the consolidated
financial statements of USLD. Immediately prior to the Distribution, BIC
canceled all of USLD intercompany payable owed to BIC. In recognition of
this, the balance of the intercompany receivable from USLD has been combined
with and included in the balance sheet caption entitled USLD investment in
and advances to BIC. All stockholder equity account balances, except for the
par value of BIC common stock, have also been reported as USLD investment in
and advances to BIC.
Certain selling, general and administrative expenses of USLD were
historically accounted for on a consolidated basis with no allocation to
individual subsidiaries. The historical statements of BIC have been adjusted to
include all of the expenses that appropriately and fairly could have been
allocated to BIC except for the income taxes. USLD federal income taxes have
historically been determined on a consolidated basis. For purposes of preparing
the BIC historical consolidated financial statements, income taxes have been
determined on a separate company basis. Deferred taxes have been recorded on
BIC consolidated financial statements, as appropriate. Tax assets and
liabilities are reflected in a manner consistent with the Tax Sharing Agreement
between USLD and BIC.
For purposes of preparing BIC consolidated financial statements,
certain amounts that were previously classified as operating revenues, cost of
revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, and other income
expense have been reclassified. Certain intercompany transactions that had
been eliminated in consolidation are properly reflected in the historical
consolidated financial statements of BIC at amounts that are believed by
management to reflect an arm-length relationship. Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
Estimates in the Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.                    29
30
Revenue Recognition Policies
The Company recognizes revenue from its billing services when records
that are to be billed and collected by the Company are processed. Revenue from
the sale of billing systems, including the licensing of software rights, is
recognized at the time that the product is delivered to the customer, provided
that the Company has no significant related obligations or collection
uncertainties remaining. If there are significant obligations related to the
installation or development of the system delivered, revenue is recognized in
the period that the Company fulfills its obligations. Services revenue related
to the Company billing systems is recognized in the period that the services
are provided.
Billing Services
The Company provides billing services to operator services providers
and direct dial long distance companies through billing agreements with the
local telephone companies, which maintain the critical database of end-user
names and addresses of the billed parties. Bills are generated by the local
telephone companies and the collected funds are remitted to the Company, which
in turn remits these funds, net of fees, to its billing customers. The Company
records a trade accounts receivable and operating revenue for fees charged for
its billing services. When the customer receivables are collected by the
Company from the local telephone companies, the Company trade receivables are
reduced by the amount corresponding to the Company processing fees and the
remaining funds are recorded as an accounts payable to billing customers.
The Company offers participation in an advance funding program to
qualifying customers through its Advance Payment Agreement. Under the terms of
this agreement, the Company purchases the customer accounts receivable for an
amount equal to the face amount of the billing records submitted to the local
telephone companies by the Company for billing and collection less     o    all local telephone company charges, rejects, unbillables and
bad debt deductions     o    all credits and adjustments granted to end-users     o    all of the Company processing fees and sales taxes, if
appropriate     o    all financing service charges assessed by the Company; and
o    any and all losses, costs or expenses incurred by the Company
in processing or collecting the customer accounts from all
previously billed records.
The purchase price is remitted by the Company to its customers in two
payments. Within five days from receiving a customer records, an initial
payment is made to the customer based on a percentage of the face amount of the
customer call records submitted by the Company to the local telephone
companies. The Company pays the remaining balance of the purchase price to the
customer upon collection of funds from the local telephone companies. The
purchase date is the date the initial payment is made. In connection with its
purchase of billing records, the Company may draw on its revolving credit
facility.                    30
31
Any accounts receivable purchased by the Company are recorded as
purchased receivables in an amount equal to the face amount of the billing
records submitted to the local telephone companies by the Company for billing
and collection. Concurrently, an equal amount is recorded as accounts payable
to billing customers. The amount of the initial payment made to the customer
reduces accounts payable to billing customers. The balance, reported as
accounts payable to billing customers $75,166,000 and $58,525,000 at September
30, 1997 and 1996, respectively, consists of     o    an amount equal to the face value of all purchased
receivables, reduced for any amounts paid as initial payments
under Advance Payment Agreements     o    an amount equal to collections from local telephone companies
that have not yet been remitted to customers, and
o    an amount accrued for the estimated liability associated with
future end-user refunds and local telephone company
adjustments related to customers who are no longer serviced by
the Company.
The purchased receivables balance is relieved at the time the customer
receivables are collected from the local telephone companies. Any differences
between the amount initially recorded as a purchased receivable and the amount
ultimately collected from the local telephone companies are recorded as a
reduction of both the purchased receivable and accounts payable to billing
customers in an equal amount. The funds are remitted to the customer after the
Company deducts the amount funded, the financing service charges earned under
the Advance Payment Agreement, local telephone company billing fees due the
Company and any end-user customer service refunds.
The Company has some risk with regard to these deductions to the extent
that they exceed the amount collected from the local telephone companies.
Generally, the Company will collect these amounts from future funds received
from the local telephone companies. However, in certain cases, such as if the
Company is no longer providing services to the customer, there may not be
adequate funds from which to collect these amounts. The Company does have the
right of offset against all funds held for the account of such customers and
may hold a first lien security interest in such billing customers' accounts,
generally including those not acquired by the Company. The Company has an
accrued liability included in the balance sheet caption entitled Accounts
payable - billing customers for the estimated amount that such deductions
exceed funds withheld from such customers.
The following receivables purchased and financed by the Company were
outstanding at                                                   SEPTEMBER 30,

Purchased receivables..................................    $70,175   $70,920
Revolving line of credit for purchased receivables...................       0   19,010 Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets, which range from three to ten years. Upon
disposition, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are
removed from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in other
income expense for that period. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred and major improvements are capitalized.                    31
32
Other Assets
Other assets include costs incurred to acquire billing agreements with
local telephone companies for billing and collection services and other
agreements. These costs are being amortized over five to seven years. Other
assets also include financing costs related to the issuance of debt, which have
been deferred and are amortized over the life of the respective financing
agreement, and goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisition of a
software development company see Note 5. In addition, long-term deposits have
been included in other assets.
Accrued Liabilities
Accrued liabilities include sales taxes payable on behalf of billing
customers of $13,061,000 and $12,025,000 at September 30, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on enacted
income tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period in which the
deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. A change
in the tax laws or rates results in adjustments to the deferred tax assets or
liabilities. The effects of such adjustments are required to be included in
income in the period in which the tax laws or rates are changed.
BIC and USLD entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that defines the
parties' respective rights and obligations with respect to deficiencies and
refunds of federal, state and other income or franchise taxes relating to BIC
business for tax years prior to the Distribution and with respect to certain
tax attributes of BIC after the Distribution. In general, with respect to
periods ending on or before the last day of the year in which the Distribution
occurred, USLD is responsible for i filing both consolidated federal tax
returns for the USLD affiliated group and combined or consolidated state tax
returns for any group that includes a member of the USLD affiliated group,
including in each case BIC and its subsidiaries for the relevant periods of
time that such companies were members of the applicable group and ii paying
the taxes related to such returns including any subsequent adjustments
resulting from the redetermination of such tax liabilities by the applicable
taxing authorities. BIC will reimburse USLD for a portion of such taxes and
the cost of preparation of the associated tax returns related to the BIC
affiliated group. BIC is responsible for filing returns and paying taxes
related to the BIC affiliated group for subsequent periods. BIC and USLD have
agreed to cooperate with each other and to share information in preparing such
tax returns and in dealing with other tax matters.
Net Income Per Common Share
Net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during
each period. Any options or warrants outstanding are considered common stock
equivalents provided they have a dilutive effect on net income per common share.
Net income per common share is presented on a pro forma basis for fiscal 1996
and 1995, as BIC had no publicly held common shares outstanding prior to the
Distribution. The unaudited pro forma net income per common share was computed
by dividing net income by the pro forma weighted average number of common shares
and common share equivalents outstanding during the applicable period. The pro
forma weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each fiscal
year gives effect to the number of shares assumed to be issued had the
Distribution occurred at the beginning of each period presented, including the
assumed conversions of options and warrants that were assumed to be outstanding
during the respective periods. The unaudited pro forma per share data is
presented for informational purposes only and should not be considered
indicative of the operating results which the Company will achieve in the future
because, among other things, this data is based on historical rather than
prospective information and includes certain assumptions which are subject to
change.                    32
33
Actual net income per common share for the period from the Distribution
Date to September 30, 1996, was $017 per share. The approximate weighted
average number of common shares and common share equivalents used in computing
actual net income per common share for the period from the Distribution Date to
September 30, 1996 was 15,761,000.
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings
Per Share, which establishes standards for computing and presenting earnings
per share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or potential
common stock. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the standards for computing EPS
previously found in Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 15,
Earnings Per Share, and makes them comparable to international EPS standards.
It replaces the presentation of primary EPS with a presentation of basic EPS,
which excludes dilution. It also requires dual presentation of basic and
diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex
capital structures. SFAS No. 128 is effective for financial statements for
periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not
permitted. After the effective date, SFAS No. 128 requires restatement of all
prior period EPS data presented.
The pro forma effect of adopting SFAS No. 128 on EPS data is as
follows                               YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,         
1997           1996           1995  
Primary EPS as reported          $023          $116           $097
Pro forma effect of SFAS No. 128      001           006           009
Basic EPS as restated           $024          $122           $106
Fully diluted EPS as reported       $022          $115           $097
Pro forma effect of SFAS No. 128      001           001           000
Diluted EPS as restated          $023          $116           $097
Basic earnings per share were computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted earnings per share differs from basic earnings per share due to
the assumed conversions of options and warrants that were outstanding during
the period.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1996, the FASB issued SFAS No. 125, Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, which
provides accounting and reporting standards for, among other things, the
transfer and servicing of financial assets, such as factoring receivables. SFAS
No. 125 is effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets occurring
after December 31, 1996 and is to be applied prospectively. In December 1996,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 127, Deferral of the Effective Date of Certain
Provisions of SFAS No. 125. SFAS No. 127 amends the effective date for certain
provisions of SFAS No. 125 to December 31, 1997. Management of the Company does
not anticipate the adoption of SFAS No. 125 and 127 will have a material
impact on the Company financial position or results of operations.                    33

NOTE 3. DEBT
Long-term debt is comprised of the following                                                    SEPTEMBER 30,

$2,324   $ 2,370
The Company has various fixed rate term notes with rates ranging from
762% to 773%, due in varying amounts through June 2002. The proceeds from the
issuance of these notes were used to acquire certain computer equipment and
office furniture. The loans are secured by the assets acquired with the
proceeds of such notes.
In December 1996, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under its
$45 million revolving line of credit, which bore interest at the prime rate
plus 05%, and matured December 31, 1996. Effective December 23, 1996, the
Company obtained a new $500 million revolving line of credit facility with
certain commercial lending institutions to finance the purchase of accounts
receivable under the Company Advance Funding Program and for general
corporate purposes. The credit facility terminates on December 20, 1999, and
bears interest at a variable rate based on the prime rate or federal funds rate
as determined by a formula defined in the credit agreement. The facility is
secured by the related accounts receivable, the stock of BIC subsidiaries and
various other assets of the Company. The amount borrowed by the Company and the
amount available for borrowing under this credit facility was $0 and $500
million, respectively, at September 30, 1997. Additionally, at September 30,
1997, the Company has a $12 million letter of credit outstanding.
Under the most restrictive terms of the Company credit agreements,
the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock, is
required to comply with certain financial covenants and is subject to certain
limitations on the issuance of additional secured debt. The Company was in
compliance with all such covenants at September 30, 1997.                    34
35
In addition to the revolving line of credit facility and equipment
financing agreements described above, the Company is also obligated as a
guarantor of USLD equipment financing agreements with certain lenders. Prior
to the Distribution, the Company obtained financing for capital expenditures
through term debt agreements and capital lease agreements that were guaranteed
and cross-collateralized by USLD and its other subsidiaries. Most of these debt
agreements were secured by the assets of all the subsidiaries within the
consolidated group, and in some cases, the existing cross guarantees and
security arrangements between the Company and USLD will remain in place for the
duration of the facility. In this regard, USLD and the Company have agreed to
pay each other a credit support fee equal to 1% per annum of the average
monthly balance of indebtedness guaranteed by one on behalf of the other for as
long as such guarantees continue. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of
indebtedness guaranteed by BIC under such agreements at September 30, 1997, was
approximately $72 million, due in varying amounts through October 2000.
Cross-default provisions of certain of these equipment loans may place the
Company in default of such loans in the event that USLD defaults under the
equipment finance agreements that the Company has guaranteed.
Scheduled maturities of debt as of September 30, 1997, are as follows                                                   IN THOUSANDS

NOTE 5. ACQUISITION
Effective June 1, 1997, the Company acquired Computer Resources
Management, Inc. CRM, a company that develops software systems for the
direct billing of telecommunications services. This acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of operations for CRM
have been included in the Company consolidated financial statements, and the
shares related to the acquisition have been included in the weighted average
shares outstanding for purposes of calculating net income per common share
since the date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma information
gives effect to the acquisition of CRM as if it had occurred at the beginning
of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma information is based on the
historical information for the periods presented and includes adjustments to
reflect the special charge resulting from expensing acquired in-process
research and development costs see Note 6 and the effect on depreciation and
amortization expense of recording the fair value of assets acquired. The number
of weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the pro forma
per share data gives effect to the shares assumed to be issued had the
acquisition occurred at the beginning of each period presented.                               YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

The pro forma financial information should not be considered indicative
of the operating results that would have occurred had the acquisition actually
taken place at the beginning of the periods specified or that the Company will
achieve in the future because, among other things, this information is based on
historical rather than prospective information and includes certain assumptions
which are subject to change. The unaudited pro forma financial information
reflects, in management opinion, all adjustments necessary to fairly state
the pro forma operating results for the periods presented to make the unaudited
pro forma financial information not misleading.
An aggregate of $85 million cash and 325,000 shares of the Company
common stock were issued in connection with this purchase transaction. Of these
shares, 65,000 were deposited in an escrow account to satisfy certain
indemnification obligations. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net tangible assets acquired was determined through an independent
appraisal and amounted to approximately $175 million, of which approximately
$12 million was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over fifteen years. In addition, $130 million was recorded as in-process
research and development expenses see Note 6. The remaining balance was
recorded as the purchase price for a customer list and other intangibles, which
are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from six to
twelve years.
NOTE 6. SPECIAL CHARGES
During the third quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recognized special
charges in the amount of $213 million. The $213 million charge included
in-process research and development costs of $130 million acquired in
connection with the acquisition of CRM see Note 5. At the date of
acquisition, the technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not
yet been established, and the technology had no future alternative uses. The
remaining $83 million charge represented accumulated costs associated with the
development of a direct billing system for a service bureau operation. This
development was abandoned by the Company.                    36

NOTE 7. SHARE CAPITAL
On July 10, 1996, the Company, upon authorization by its Board of
Directors, adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan Rights Plan and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each share of its outstanding
common stock. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company common stock or announces a tender offer, the
consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or
more of the Company common stock. These rights, which expire on July 10,
2006, entitle stockholders to buy one ten-thousandth of a share of a new series
of participating preferred shares at a purchase price of $130 per one
ten-thousandth of a preferred share. The Rights Plan was designed to ensure
that stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed
takeover of the Company.
On August 2, 1996, USLD distributed 15,032,001 shares of the Company
common stock to the existing stockholders of USLD in order to effect the
spin-off of BIC from USLD. Prior to August 2, 1996, BIC operated as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of USLD and, consequently, had no publicly owned common
shares. No dividends were paid on the Company common stock during fiscal
1997, 1996 or 1995.
NOTE 8. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS
Prior to the Distribution, the Company adopted the BIC 1996
Comprehensive Stock Plan Comprehensive Plan and the BIC 1996 Non-Employee
Director Plan Director Plan under which officers and employees, and
non-employee directors, respectively, of the Company and its affiliates are
eligible to receive stock option grants. The Company has reserved 3,500,000 and
400,000 shares of its common stock for issuance pursuant to the Comprehensive
Plan and Director Plan, respectively. Under each plan, options vest and expire
pursuant to individual award agreements; however, the expiration date of
unexercised options may not exceed ten years from the date of grant.
Immediately prior to the Distribution, the Company granted, under the
Comprehensive Plan and Director Plan, respectively, options to purchase BIC
common stock to each holder of an outstanding option to purchase shares of USLD
common stock under the USLD Employee Stock Option Plan and the USLD
Non-Employee Director Plan, respectively. The BIC options are exercisable for
BIC common stock on the basis of one share of BIC common stock for every one
share of USLD common stock subject to the outstanding USLD options. BIC options
to purchase a total of 1,566,504 shares of BIC common stock were granted in
connection with the adjustment to the USLD options. In connection with the
grant of the BIC options, the exercise price of the USLD options was adjusted
to preserve the economic value of the USLD options existing immediately prior
to the Distribution after giving effect to the grant of the BIC options. The
BIC options will have vesting schedules mirroring the vesting schedules of the
related USLD options. Each BIC option granted in connection with the
Distribution will terminate in accordance with the original USLD option grant.
Option activity for the years ended September 30, 1997 and 1996 is

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, but has elected to apply APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock option plans as allowed under SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, the Company has
not recognized compensation expense for stock options granted where the
exercise price is equal to the market price of the underlying stock at the date
of the grant. During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company recognized
$540,000, $10,000 and $18,000, respectively, of compensation expense for
options granted below the market price of the underlying stock on such
measurement date. In addition, in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion
No. 25, the Company has not recognized compensation expense for employee stock
purchases under the Billing Information Concepts Corp. Employee Stock Purchase
Plan ESPP.
Had compensation expense for the Company stock options granted and ESPP
purchases in 1997 and 1996 been determined based on the fair value at the grant
dates consistent with the methodology of SFAS No. 123, pro forma net income and
net income per common share would have been as follows in thousands, except

for the year ended September 30, 1997, and $1014 and $1046 for the year 
ended September 30, 1996. The weighted average fair value and weighted 
average exercise price of options granted during the year ended September 30, 
1997 where the exercise price was below the market price of the underlying 
stock at the grant date was $895 and $2600, respectively. For purposes 
of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of options is 
amortized to expense over the options' vesting periods.                    38

Warrants to purchase 225,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price
of $925 per share were granted during fiscal 1996 immediately prior to the
Distribution to each holder of a warrant to purchase shares of USLD common stock
and had a weighted average fair value of $1202. The fair value for these
warrants was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with an expected volatility of 25%, an expected dividend yield of 0%, an
expected life of 2 years and a risk-free interest rate of 609% as the
weighted-average assumptions. Warrants to purchase 87,677 shares of common stock
were exercised in fiscal 1997. There were no warrants exercised in fiscal 1996.

NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in various claims, legal actions and regulatory
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it
is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which
the Company is a party will have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations; however, due to the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any
particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution
occurred.
The Company is obligated to pay certain local telephone companies a total
of approximately $69 million, $57 million, $42 million, $41 million, $41
million and $110 million during fiscal 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and
thereafter, respectively, for minimum usage charges under billing and
collection agreements that, unless automatically renewed, expire at varying
dates through the end of fiscal 2005. The billing and collection agreements do
not provide for any penalties other than payment of the obligation should the
usage levels not be met. The Company has met all such volume commitments in the
past and anticipates exceeding the minimum usage volumes with all of these
vendors.
The Distribution Agreement see Note 12 provides the Company will only
assume liabilities and obligations for claims and litigation that arose from
the ordinary course of the Company business. The Company will not assume any
liabilities that relate to the direct dial long distance and operator service
businesses of USLD. The Company is obligated as a guarantor of USLD equipment
financing agreements with certain lenders. The aggregate unpaid principal
amount of indebtedness under such agreements at September 30, 1997 was
approximately $72 million, due in varying amounts through October 2000.                    41

the One Plus Billing and Information Management Services Agreement, and the
Telecommunications Agreement reflect terms and conditions similar to those that
would have been arrived at by independent parties bargaining at arm length;
however, there can be no assurances that such agreements are on terms at least
as favorable as could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.                    42
