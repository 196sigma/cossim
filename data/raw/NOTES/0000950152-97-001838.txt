NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994
dollars in thousands
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Olympic Steel, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively the Company
or Olympic, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION RISKS
The Company is a major customer of flat-rolled coil and plate steel for many of
its principal suppliers, but is not dependent on any one supplier. In 1996, the
Company purchased approximately 18% of its total steel requirements from a
single supplier.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include the cost of
purchased steel, internal and external processing and freight. Cost is
determined using the specific identification method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND DEPRECIATION
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years.
GOODWILL AND AMORTIZATION
Goodwill includes the cost in excess of fair value of the net assets acquired
and is being amortized on a straight-line method over 40 years. In the event
that facts and circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other
long-lived assets may be impaired, the Company evaluates recoverability to
determine if a write-down to market value is required. Goodwill amortization
expense totaled $260 in both 1996 and 1995. Amortization expense in 1994 totaled
$132 and related to a covenant not to compete agreement that expired in 1994.
Accumulated amortization of goodwill totaled $520 and $260 at December 31, 1996
and 1995, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized when steel is shipped to the customer. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on
historical experience and current estimates.
INCOME TAXES
In the first quarter of 1994, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFAS No. 109 utilizes the liability method and deferred taxes are determined
based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial
and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax
laws.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per share has been calculated based on the weighted average number of
shares outstanding. Shares outstanding were 46 million from January 1, 1994
through March 16, 1994, 86 million from March 17, 1994 through August 8, 1996
and 107 million since August 9, 1996. Primary and fully diluted earnings per
share are the same as the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options is
immaterial.                 PAGE 24 of 88
25 2. PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK:
The Company completed its initial public offering of 4 million common shares in
March, 1994. The $56,995 of net proceeds were used to pay a $17,500 final S
corporation dividend, and the remaining proceeds were used to repay $39,495 of
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. In August, 1996, the Company
completed the sale of an additional 21 million shares of common stock. The net
proceeds of $49,100 were used to repay borrowings outstanding under the
Company bank credit agreements. 3. ACQUISITION:
Effective January 1, 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Lafayette
Steel Company Lafayette Steel. Lafayette Steel is an intermediate steel
processor headquartered in Detroit, Michigan, primarily serving the automotive
industry.
The final purchase price totaled $69,833 and exceeded the net book value of the
assets acquired by $13,000. The adjusted cash portion of the purchase price,
including fees and expenses and the repayment of $30,069 of Lafayette Steel
existing bank debt, totaled $52,345.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, assets
and liabilities are reflected at estimated fair values. The final purchase price
allocation resulted in goodwill of $10,395, which is being amortized over 40
years.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed statement of income for 1994 gives
effect to the acquisition of Lafayette Steel as if it had occurred on January 1,
1994. The pro forma information is based upon the historical financial
statements of Olympic Steel and Lafayette Steel, giving effect to the
acquisition under the purchase method of accounting. The pro forma financial
information has been prepared by Olympic management based upon the audited
financial statements of Lafayette Steel. This pro forma information is presented
in response to applicable accounting rules relating to business acquisitions. It
is not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been
achieved had the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 1994, and is not
necessarily indicative of future results of the combined companies.                                       PRO FORMA      PRO FORMA

26 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:
On December 19, 1995, the Company entered into a three-year agreement to sell,
on a revolving basis, through its wholly-owned entity, Olympic Steel Receivables
LLC, an undivided interest in a designated pool of its trade accounts
receivable. The maximum amount of receivables that can be sold is $65,000, with
the amount sold at any month end measurement date dependent upon the level of
defined eligible receivables. The Company, as agent for the purchaser of the
receivables, retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the
participating interests sold. As collections reduce the receivables included in
the pool, the Company may sell additional undivided interests in new receivables
up to the $65,000 limit. The amount of receivables sold by the Company typically
will change monthly depending upon the level of defined eligible receivables
available for sale each month end.
As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, $55,000 and $53,671, respectively, of
receivables were sold and reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds from the initial sale were
used to reduce borrowings under the Company revolving credit agreement and are
reflected as operating cash flows in the accompanying 1995 consolidated
statement of cash flows. Costs of the program, which primarily consist of the
purchaser financing cost of issuing commercial paper backed by the
receivables, totaled $3,393 in 1996 and $107 in 1995, and have been classified
as Receivable Securitization Expense in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income.
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts of

payable quarterly in arrears while interest on the LIBOR option is payable at
the end of the LIBOR interest period, which ranges from one to six months. The
agreement also includes a commitment fee of 25% of the unused portion of the
revolver which is payable quarterly in arrears. 7. TAXABLE RATE NOTES:
In October 1993, the Company completed a $10,000 refinancing of its real estate
in Minneapolis, Minnesota; Milford, Connecticut; Elk Grove Village, Illinois;
and Cleveland, Ohio. The refinancing was in the form of taxable rate notes. The
term of the notes is 15 years with annual principal payments of $700 for the
first 10 years and $600 for years 11 through 15. As of December 31, 1996, $7,900
was outstanding. The notes are backed by a three year bank letter of credit,
expiring October 15, 1999, and are secured by a first mortgage on the Chicago,
Connecticut and Minneapolis land and buildings and a second mortgage on certain
Cleveland real estate. The interest rate changes each week based on the taxable
rate note market. As of December 31, 1996, the effective interest rate was 74%. 8. INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS:
The long-term portion of industrial revenue bonds at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
consisted of the following                             Effective Interest
Description of Bonds            Rate at 12/31/96     1996     1995

fair values, as each of the Company debt arrangements bear interest at rates
that vary based on a bank base rate, LIBOR, the short-term tax exempt revenue
bond index or taxable rate note market.

minimum net worth, capital expenditure limitations, and interest coverages. The
Company was in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 1996. 10. INCOME TAXES:
