INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
QLogic Corporation   We have audited the consolidated financial statements of QLogic Corporation
and subsidiaries as listed in Item 14a. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the financial statement
schedule as listed in Item 14a. These consolidated financial statements and
the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QLogic
Corporation and subsidiaries as of April 1, 2001 and April 2, 2000 and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended April 1, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

QLOGIC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General Business Information
QLogic Corporation QLogic or the Company designs and supplies
semiconductor and board level input/output I/O products, full fabric switches,
and enclosure management semiconductors. The Company I/O products provide a
high performance interface between computer systems and their attached data
storage peripherals, such as hard disk drives, tape drives, removable disk
drives and redundant array of independent disks subsystems, or RAID subsystems.
QLogic markets and distributes its products through a direct sales organization
supported by field application engineers, as well as through a network of
independent manufacturers' representatives and regional and international
distributors. The Company primary OEM customers are major domestic and
international suppliers and manufacturers of servers, workstations and data
storage peripherals.
Principles of Consolidation and Financial Reporting Period
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
QLogic Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
QLogic fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest March 31. The fiscal year ended
April 1, 2001 fiscal 2001 comprised 52 weeks, the fiscal year ended April 2,
2000 fiscal 2000 comprised 53 weeks and the fiscal year ended March 28, 1999
fiscal 1999 comprised 52 weeks.
As more fully described in Note 2, QLogic merged with Ancor
Communications, Inc. Ancor on August 1, 2000 in a pooling of interests
transaction. Historically, the fiscal year of Ancor ended on December 31. In
order to report the historical fiscal year ends, the Company consolidated
financial statements for the year ended March 28, 1999 were restated to include
Ancor consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1998.
All years prior to March 28, 1999 were restated similarly. The Company
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2000 were
restated to include the Ancor balance sheet at March 31, 2000, and the results
of operations and cash flows of Ancor for the twelve months ended December 31,
1999. Ancor net revenues and net loss of $69 million and $29 million,
respectively, in the three months ended March 31, 2000 were included as a
retained earnings adjustment in the fiscal year ended April 2, 2000. During the
three months ended March 31, 2000 Ancor issued 385,000 shares of common stock
with net proceeds of $64 million. Net cash outflow during the three months
ended March 31, 2000 amounted to $144 million.
All references to share and per share data have been restated to give
effect to the Company stock splits.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires
management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is generally recognized upon product shipment. Royalty revenue is
recognized when earned and receipt is assured. The customer obligation to pay
the Company, and the payment terms, are set at the time of shipment and are not
dependent on subsequent resale of the Company product. However, certain of the
Company sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing limited right
of return and/or price protection. The Company recognizes revenue through these
distribution channels based on management estimate as to the approximate point
the products have been resold. The Company warrants its products, on a limited
basis, to be free from defects for periods of one to five years from date of
shipment. The Company
27

QLOGIC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
estimates and establishes allowances and reserves for product returns, warranty
obligations, doubtful accounts, and price adjustments. During fiscal year 2001,
the Company adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended.
The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a material impact on the Company
consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
Net Income per Share
The Company applies the provisions of SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. Basic
net income per common share was computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted net income per
share was computed based on the weighted average number of common and dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the periods presented. The Company
has granted certain stock options and warrants which have been treated as
dilutive potential common shares in computing diluted net income per share.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For certain of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable , accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their
short maturities. Long-term investments are carried at cost which approximates
fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents,
investments in marketable securities, and trade accounts receivable. The Company
places its marketable securities primarily in municipal bonds, corporate bonds
and government securities, all of which are high investment grade. The Company,
by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure through diversification and
investment in highly rated securities. Sales to customers are denominated in
U.S. dollars. As a result, the Company believes its foreign currency risk is
minimal.
The Company sells its products to original equipment manufacturers and
distributors throughout the world. The Company four largest customers comprise
of 56% of total accounts receivable at April 1, 2001 and 53% at April 2, 2000.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. The Company
maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable. There have not been significant
losses experienced on accounts receivable.

QLOGIC CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of
three months or less on their acquisition date to be cash equivalents.
Investments
The Company invests primarily in debt securities. During the second fiscal
quarter ended October 1, 2001, the Company changed its classification of these
securities based on management intent from held to maturity to available
for sale according to the definitions of SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. Accordingly, the Company debt
securities are carried at fair value in short-term investments in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of
the related tax effect, if any, are excluded from earnings and reported as a
separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains
or losses and other than temporary declines in fair value are determined on a
specific identification basis and reported in other income and expense as
incurred.
The Company also holds minority investments in companies that are not
publicly traded. These investments are recorded at cost and are included in
other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company
monitors these investments for impairment by reference to valuation of publicly
traded companies in similar sectors and other factors such as the status of the
investee technology, product launch and customer acceptance. In some
circumstances, the Company may obtain an independent valuation of the
investment. If the Company determines that the investment has suffered an other
than temporary decline in value, this decline is reported in other income or
expense in the period in which the determination is made. As of April 1, 2001 no
other than temporary declines in value had occurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or net
realizable value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an
asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of two to 395 years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its employee and director stock options and
employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which was
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1995, provided an
alternative to APB 25, but allowed companies to account for employee and
director stock-based compensation under the current intrinsic value method as
29

prescribed by APB 25. The Company has continued to account for its employee and

NOTE 2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Little Mountain Group, Inc.
On January 23, 2001, the Company acquired the outstanding common stock of
Little Mountain Group, Inc. LMG, for cash and stock which could amount to
$30 million over a four-year period. LMG is a designer of iSCSI silicon and
board level products to enable an ethernet Storage Area Network. The Company
accounted for the transaction as a purchase. Accordingly, the excess purchase
price paid over the fair value of the LMG net assets of $71 million was
recorded as goodwill, and will be amortized over five years. The structure of
the acquisition includes payments of stock based on performance milestones to be
achieved over the next four fiscal years. These payments will be charged to
engineering and development expense as the performance milestones are achieved.
Ancor Communications, Inc.
On August 1, 2000, the Company completed its merger with Ancor
Communications, Incorporated Ancor. Ancor was a leading provider of Fibre
Channel switches. In connection with the merger, the Company issued 15,535,835
shares of its common stock in exchange for all shares of Ancor common stock
and reserved 1,724,036 shares of its common stock for issuance upon exercise of
outstanding Ancor employee stock options and other rights assumed by the
Company. The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly,
the Company consolidated financial statements have been restated to include
the pooled operations of Ancor as if it had combined with the Company since
Ancor inception. Included in net revenues for fiscal year 2000 and 1999 were
net revenues from Ancor of $130 and $44 million, respectively. Included in
restated net income for fiscal year 2000 and 1999 were net losses from Ancor of
approximately $87 million and $153 million, respectively. Restated diluted net
income per share for fiscal year 2000 and 1999 included losses of $009 and
$018 per share, respectively, from Ancor. Included in net revenues for the year
ended April 1, 2001, was $94 million from Ancor, recognized prior to the
closing of the merger on August 1, 2000. Included in net income for the year
ended April 1, 2001 were losses totaling $38 million from

Ancor, incurred prior to August 1, 2000. There were no transactions between the
Company and Ancor prior to the consummation of the merger.
In connection with the merger with Ancor, the Company recorded
approximately $229 million in charges for direct and other merger-related costs
including fees of investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other direct
and incremental charges. Substantially all of the merger-related costs and fees
have been paid at April 1, 2001.
AdaptiveRAID Technology
On January 10, 2000, the Company acquired certain intellectual property
AdaptiveRAIDR technology from Borg Adaptive Technologies, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of nStor Corporation. The AdaptiveRAIDR technology, which was
expected to provide next generation embedded RAID storage solutions for the
Intel Architecture workstation market, was purchased for $75 million in cash.
At the time of the acquisition, the AdaptiveRAIDR technology was in the
development stage with no completed commercially viable storage solution
products and thus the entire purchase price was written-off to acquired
in-process technology. On February 26, 2001, the technology was sold to
YottaYotta, Inc. in exchange for a note receivable. The note is immediately
payable upon completion of YottaYotta, Inc. qualified financing, which is
currently in process. Due to the uncertainty regarding collection of the note,
the Company will record the ultimate gain from the sale of this technology upon
the collection of the note receivable from YottaYotta, Inc.
Silicon Design Resources, Inc.
On August 20, 1998, the Company acquired the net assets of Silicon Design
Resources, Inc. SDR for $2 million in cash. In addition, the Company is
obligated to pay up to an additional $8 million in cash provided that certain
performance targets are achieved through fiscal year 2002. These payments will
be accounted for as additional purchase price and allocated to the intangible
assets acquired, specifically the in-process technology and the completed
technology. The Company accounted for the transaction using the purchase method
of accounting, and excluding the initial write-off of the acquired in-process
technology in the quarter ended September 27, 1998, the impact to the Company
financial position and results of operations from the acquisition date was not
material. Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $413,000 in
professional fees related to the acquisition.
At April 1, 2001 and April 2, 2000, a performance payment to the former
shareholders of SDR of $1,244,000 and $841,000, respectively, was included in
other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These
payments were allocated to the intangible assets acquired: $820,000 and
$554,000, respectively, were written-off as acquired in-process technology and
$424,000 and $287,000, respectively, were capitalized as completed technology.
NOTE 3 NET INCOME PER SHARE
The Company computed basic net income per share based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
Diluted income per share was computed based on the weighted average number of
common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods

Preferred Stock
In fiscal 1994, the Company stockholders approved an amendment and
restatement of the certificate of incorporation which authorized the future
issuance of 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $010 par value, with rights
and preferences to be determined by the Board of Directors. In January 2000, the
par value was adjusted to $0001.
Shareholder Rights Plan
On June 4, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously adopted
a Shareholder Rights Plan the Rights Plan pursuant to which it declared a
dividend distribution of preferred stock purchase rights a Right upon all of
the outstanding shares of the common stock.
The Rights dividend was paid on June 20, 1996 to the holders of record of
shares of common stock on that date, at the rate of one-eighth of one whole
Right per one share of common stock, as adjusted pursuant to the Company stock
splits. Each share of common stock presently outstanding that had been issued
since June 20, 1996 also includes one-eighth Right, and each share of common
stock that may be issued after the date hereof and prior to the Distribution
Date as defined below also will include one-eighth Right.
The Rights become exercisable i the 10th business day following the date
of a public announcement that a person or a group of affiliated or associated
persons an Acquiring Person has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of common stock, or ii the 10th business day
following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make a tender
offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the person or
group making the offer becoming an Acquiring Person the earlier of the dates
described in clauses i and ii being called the Distribution Date.
The Rights held by an Acquiring Person or its affiliates are not
exercisable. All shares of common stock that will be issued prior to the
Distribution Date will include such Rights. The Rights will expire at the close
of business on June 4, 2006 the Scheduled Expiration Date, unless prior
thereto the Distribution Date occurs, or unless the Scheduled Expiration Date is
extended.
Pursuant to the Rights Plan, as amended to date, each Right entitles the
registered holder, on and after the Distribution Date and until redemption of
all Rights, to purchase from the Company 1/100 of one whole share a Unit of
the Company Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $001 per
share the Series A Preferred Stock. The purchase price is $42500 per Unit.
In the event of certain acquisitions involving the Acquiring Person , directly
or indirectly, the holder of each Right will be entitled to purchase for $42500
certain shares or assets of the Company or an Acquiring person that have a
market value of $85000 at such time.
The Company has 200,000 whole shares of Series A Preferred Stock authorized
40,000,000 Units authorized, of which no shares or Units are issued or
outstanding at April 1, 2001. Each Unit would entitle the holder to A one
vote, voting together with the shares of common stock; B in the event the
Company assets are liquidated, a payment of one dollar $100 or an amount
equal to the payment to be distributed per share of common stock, whichever is
greater; and C in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction
in which shares of common stock are exchanged, a payment in an amount equal to
the payment received per share of common stock. The number of Rights per share
of common stock, and the purchase price, is subject to adjustment in the event
of each and any stock split, stock dividend or similar event.
Holders of Rights will be entitled to purchase shares or assets of the
Company or an Acquiring Person with a value that is double the exercise price in
the event of certain acquisitions involving the Acquiring Person, directly or
indirectly.

NOTE 8 STOCK PLANS
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In fiscal year 1999, the Company Board of Directors adopted an Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees of the Company who
elect to participate are granted options to purchase common stock at a 15%
discount from the lower of the market value of the common stock at the beginning
or end of each three month offering period. The ESPP permits an enrolled
employee to make contributions to purchase shares of common stock by having
withheld from their salary an amount between 1% and 10% of compensation. The
ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to
options granted under the ESPP is 2,400,000. The total number of shares issued
under the ESPP were 145,831 and 79,572 as of the years ended April 1, 2001 and
April 2, 2000, respectively.
Incentive Compensation Plans
On January 12, 1994, the Company Board of Directors adopted the QLogic
Corporation Stock Awards Plan the Stock Awards Plan and the QLogic
Corporation Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan
collectively the Stock Option Plans. Additionally, the Company issues
options on an ad hoc basis from time to time.
The Stock Awards Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and
non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based incentive
awards for officers and key employees. The Stock Awards Plan permits the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to select eligible employees to
receive awards and to determine the terms and conditions of awards. As of April
1, 2001, a total of 22,800,000 shares were reserved for issuance under the Stock
Awards Plan, no shares of restricted stock were issued, options to purchase
6,404,664 shares of Common Stock were outstanding, and there were 7,447,180
shares available for future grants.
Options granted under the Company Stock Awards Plan provide that an
employee holding a stock option may exchange mature stock which the employee
already owns as payment against the exercise of an option. This provision
applies to all options outstanding as of April 1, 2001. All stock options
granted under the Company Stock Awards Plan have ten-year terms and vest
ratably over four years from the date of grant.
Under the terms of the Director Plan, new directors receive an option
grant, at fair market value, to purchase 64,000 shares of common stock of the
Company upon election to the Board, and the plan provides for annual grants to
each non-employee director other than the Chairman of the Board of options to
purchase 32,000 shares of common stock. The plan also provides for annual grants
to the Chairman of the Board of options to purchase 54,000 shares of common
stock. A total of 1,800,000 shares have been reserved for issuance under the
Director Plan. As of April 1, 2001, options for a total of 405,999 shares were
outstanding, and 489,338 shares were available for grant. All stock options
granted under the Director Plan have ten-year terms and vest ratably over three
years from the date of grant.
As of April 1, 2001, ad hoc stock options have been issued representing
options to purchase 80,000 shares, with a total of 48,500 options outstanding.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
As a result of the Company acquisitions, the Company assumed stock
options granted under stock option plans established by each acquired company;
no additional options will be granted under those plans. As of April 1, 2001,
1,832,050 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under these stock
option plans, with options to purchase 639,502 shares outstanding.
Warrants
As part of an agreement with Sun Microsystems, Inc. Sun, the Company
granted a warrant to Sun to purchase up to 791,250 shares of the Company
common stock at an exercise price of $1384 per share. The warrant shares are
earned at the rate of one share for each $12700 of switch product revenue the
Company receives from Sun through September 30, 2002. In each period in which
the warrant shares are earned, a non-cash sales discount is recorded. The amount
of non-cash sales discount is the fair value of the warrant shares which are
earned in the period. The fair value of the warrant shares is calculated by
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The assumptions used in the fair
value calculation of the warrant shares was consistent with those assumptions
disclosed in the Pro Forma Information later in this Note. None of the warrant
shares vested until the Company received a total of $10 million in cumulative
switch product revenue from Sun. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001,
approximately 79,125 warrants became vested as switch revenues from Sun reached
$10 million. Warrants will continue to vest quarterly through September 30,

Black-Scholes model, as well as other currently accepted option valuation
models, was developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully
transferable options without vesting restrictions, which significantly differ
from the Company stock option awards. These models also require highly
subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected
time until exercise, which greatly effect the calculated fair value on the grant
date. The weighted average estimated fair value of options granted under the
Company Stock Option Plans during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $6110 3035 and $2232, respectively.

Based upon the Company current and historical pre-tax earnings,
management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the
benefit of the existing net deferred tax assets as of April 1, 2001. Management
believes the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during
periods in which the Company generates net taxable income or that there would be
sufficient tax carry backs available; however, there can be no assurance that
the Company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing
earnings in future years.
The tax benefits associated with dispositions from employee stock plans of
approximately $527 million, $34 million and $58 million in fiscal 2001, 2000
and 1999 respectively, were recorded directly to additional paid-in capital.
As of April 1, 2001 the Company has federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $453 million and aggregate state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $296 million. The federal net operating
loss carryforwards expire on various dates between 2009 and 2020. The aggregate
state net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates between 2002 and
2015. All net operating loss carryforwards relate to acquired companies and are
subject to limitations on their utilization.
As of April 1, 2001 the Company has federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $7 million and $1 million respectively. If not
utilized, the federal and state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in
2006. Approximately $2 million of the federal and $245,000 of the state tax
credits relate to acquired companies and are subject to limitations on their
utilization.
