Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Elamex, S.A. de C.V.
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of
Qualcore S de R.L. de C.V. a consolidated subsidiary, which statements reflect
total assets constituting 7% of consolidated total assets as of December 31,
1999 and total revenues constituting 6% of the consolidated total revenues for
the year then ended. Those statements were audited by other auditors whose
report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the
amounts included for Qualcore S de R.L. de C.V. is based solely on the report of
such other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditors, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

- 
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Company Background - Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries Elamex
or the Company are primarily Mexican companies incorporated under the laws of
Mexico. During 1999, the Company acquired a U.S. Company, Precision Tool, Die
and Machine Company, Inc. see Note 3. Elamex provides contract assembly
services and contract electronics manufacturing services to customers primarily
located in the United States and Canada. The Company manufactures products
mainly for companies in the electronics industry as well as in the
electromechanical, mechanical, appliance, avionics, medical appliance, heating,
venting and air conditioning, and automotive industries. The Company views
itself as a single reportable segment. All of the Company manufacturing
machinery and equipment are located in facilities in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua,
Nuevo Laredo, Saltillo, Monterrey, Tijuana, Torreon, and Delicias, Mexico, and
in Louisville, Kentucky.
During 1998, the Company purchased 2,525,000 shares $1 per share of
Series A 9% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock Preferred Stock of
Optimag, Inc. Optimag, a California corporation. At December 31, 1998,
Preferred Stock was converted into 51% of the outstanding common stock. A
majority of the Board members of Optimag were Elamex directors. Optimag was
formed to develop, manufacture, and market optical inspection stations and
electrical test equipment to companies that produce disk drive heads, magnetic
media, and optical heads and optical media. The Company consolidated the
operations of this investment. On October 18, 1999, the Company sold its
interest in Optimag to Veeco Instruments, Inc., for $2,294,925 and recognized a
gain of $2,626,561, which is reflected in the 1999 results of operations.
The Company is a subsidiary of Accel, S.A. de C.V. Accel which owns
approximately 59% of the Company issued and outstanding common shares at
December 31, 1999.
Basis of Presentation - These consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes are prepared in U.S. dollars, the functional and reporting
currency of Elamex.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America U.S. and include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries including, effective as of July
27, 1999, the accounts of Precision Tool, Die and Machine Company, Inc.
Precision. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.
Management Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires
management to make certain estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
2. DISPOSITION AGREEMENT
On March 30, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with Plexus
Corp., pursuant to which the Company will sell to Plexus Corp. all of its assets
and liabilities related to its contract electronics manufacturing services. The consummation of the transaction
contemplated by the agreement would be subject to certain conditions.
The Company contract electronics manufacturing services operations
represent approximately 10% of the Company consolidated net assets at
December 31, 1999 and 10% of the Company consolidated revenues for the year
ended December 31, 1999.
3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash includes deposits in Mexican banks,
denominated in Mexican pesos, of approximately $157,000 and $94,000 at December
31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and deposits denominated in U.S. dollars of
approximately $207,000 and $880,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
in U.S. banks. The Company had approximately $6,800,000 and $4,723,000 at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of short-term repurchase agreements,
denominated in U.S. dollars, deposited in U.S. banks.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable considered
to be uncollectible.
An analysis of the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 is as follows                     1999     1998     1997
Beginning balance        $ 631,000  $ 528,000  $ 525,000
Additions charged to expense          240,000   311,000
Accounts written off       288,000  137,000  308,000
Recoveries
Ending balance         $ 343,000  $ 631,000  $ 528,000
Foreign Currency Translation - The functional currency of the Company is
the U.S. dollar, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
Company operates. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and
remeasurement of balance sheet amounts are reflected in net income. Included in
other, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings are foreign
exchange gains losses of $93,736, $168,149, and $55,517 for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Assets and liabilities of
the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain amounts as
indicated below. Certain balance sheet amounts primarily inventories, property,
plant and equipment, accumulated depreciation, prepaid expenses, and common
stock denominated in other than U.S. dollars are remeasured at the rates in
effect at the time the relevant transaction was recorded, and all other assets
and liabilities are remeasured at rates effective as of the end of the related
periods. Revenues and expenses denominated in other than U.S. dollars are
remeasured at weighted-average exchange rates for the relevant period the
transaction was recorded. Assets and liabilities    denominated in pesos are summarized as follows in U.S. dollars at the
exchange rate published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion the Official
Gazette of the Federation, which is the approximate rate at which a receivable
or payable can be settled as of each period end                           1999      1998
Cash and cash equivalents        $  121,077  $  177,459
Other receivables             1,917,023    878,101
Prepaid expenses              4,489,299   1,851,550
Other assets, net              598,237    212,967
Accounts payable             1,828,987   355,023
Accrued expenses and other liabilities  7,215,736  1,190,945
Net foreign currency position      $1,919,087  $ 1,574,109
In addition, the Company has recorded a net deferred tax liability
pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes see Note 8. The recorded amounts of $5,442,819
and $6,808,493 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, represent the net
dollar value of amounts provided for temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective Mexican tax bases.
Foreign Exchange Instruments - The Company maintains a policy of not
engaging in futures contracts with the purpose of hedging U.S. dollar/peso
revenues or costs, with the exception of regular treasury operations to cover
operating requirements for up to 30 days. The Company had no open hedge
contracts at December 31, 1999 or 1998.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost
is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO method. Inventory cost
includes material, labor, and overhead. Inventory reserves, which are charged to
cost of sales, are provided for excess inventory, obsolete inventory, and for
differences between inventory cost and its net realizable value.
Research and Development Costs - Research and development was conducted
through Optimag until its sale on October 18, 1999. Research and development
costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $1,227,657 and $2,072,983
during 1999 and 1998, respectively. No research and development cost was
incurred during 1997.
Property, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment are stated
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Plant and equipment
under capital leases are stated at the lower of their fair value at the
inception of the lease or the present value of minimum lease payments.
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over
the shorter of related lease terms or estimated useful lives of the assets. The
policy of the Company is to charge amounts expended for maintenance and repairs
to expense and to capitalize expenditures for major replacements and
improvements.
Goodwill - Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20
years; accumulated amortization was approximately $248,000 at December 31, 1999.
Long-Lived Assets - The Company records impairment losses on long-lived
assets, including goodwill, used in operations when events and circumstances
indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of
those assets.
Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share - Basic and diluted net income per
share of common stock was calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. There are no
potentially dilutive securities.
Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 109. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under SFAS No. 109, the
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
Provisions for taxes are made based upon the applicable tax laws of Mexico
or the United States. In conformity with SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and liabilities
that are remeasured from pesos into U.S. dollars using historical exchange rates
and that result from indexing for Mexican tax purposes or exchange rate changes.
Revenue Recognition - Contract electronic manufacturing services sales are
recognized at the time the order is shipped. Sales from contract assembly
services are recognized over the contract period as services are provided.
Anticipated losses on contract electronic manufacturing services are charged to
operations as soon as they are determined.
Employees' Statutory Profit Sharing - A provision for deferred employees'
statutory profit sharing is computed on income subject to statutory profit
sharing which differs from net income, due to certain differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for statutory profit sharing and book
purposes.
Postretirement Benefits - Employees are entitled to certain benefits upon
retirement after 15 years or more of service seniority premiums, in accordance
with the Mexican Federal Labor Law. The benefits are accrued as a liability and
recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered.
Fiscal Year - The Company uses 13-week quarters ending on a Sunday, except
that the first quarter starts on January 1, and the fourth quarter ends on
December 31.
Financial Instruments - The carrying amounts of financial instruments,
including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued
expenses, notes payable, taxes payable, and amounts due to related parties,
approximated fair value as of December 31, 1999 because of the relatively short
maturity of these instruments. The fair values of floating rate long-term debt
are estimated to be equivalent to their carrying amount based on current market
conditions.
Acquisitions - On July 27, 1999, the Company acquired Precision in a
business combination accounted for as a purchase. Precision is primarily engaged
in the manufacture of stamped metal components for the appliance, heating,
venting and air conditioning, and automotive industries. The results of
operations of Precision are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements since the date of acquisition. The total cost of the acquisition was
approximately $20,343,000, which exceeded the fair value of the net assets of
Precision by approximately $10,197,000. The excess is being amortized on the
straight-line method over 20 years.
The following summarized pro forma unaudited information assumes the
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 1998.
1999      1998
Net sales               $192,756,345  $188,645,487
Net income               $ 4,187,126  $ 4,091,438
Basic and diluted earnings per share  $    061  $    056
Joint Venture - On July 14, 1998, the Company formed a Joint Venture
JV with General Electric International Mexico, S.A. de C.V. GE to
produce plastic molding and stamped metal components in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
The Company contributed its plastic molding and stamped metal operations to the JV in exchange for 501% interest in the JV. GE paid
approximately $3,500,000 to the Company in exchange for a 499% interest. In
connection with the JV, GE received a three-year warrant to purchase up to 63%
of Elamex common stock, exercisable at $781 per share subject to
anti-dilution provisions. GE also received the right to select a representative
on the Company Board. The warrant was valued at $50,000. The JV began with a
$10,000,000 commitment of business from GE. The Company recognized a gain on the
sale of a 49% interest of the plastics molding and stamped metal operations of
$774,505, which is included in other income for the year ended December 31,
1998. A majority of the Board members of the JV are Elamex Board members. The
Company has consolidated the operations of the JV.
New Accounting Pronouncements - In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended
SFAS No. 133, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain hedging instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities. The Company is required to adopt this SFAS
by January 1, 2001. Given the Company current operations and policies, the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 is not expected to have a significant impact on the
financial statements of the Company.
Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 1999 financial statement presentation.

8. INCOME TAXES
Mexican tax legislation requires that companies pay a tax calculated as
the greater of tax resulting from taxable income or tax on the total value of
certain assets less certain liabilities assets tax. Taxes resulting from net
income are calculated using Mexican tax regulations, which define deductibility
of expenses and recognize certain effects of inflation.
Effective January 1, 1999, a new tax rate was enacted in Mexico whereby
the corporate tax rate is 32% on taxable earnings and 3% on all dividends for
the year ended December 31, 1999 and 30% on taxable earnings and 5% on all
dividends for the year ended December 31, 2000 and thereafter.
The tax provision differs from the statutory tax rate of 35% in 1999 and
34% in 1998 and 1997 on taxable income as follows                                         1999    1998    1997

The valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. During
1997, the Company provided a valuation allowance for certain deferred asset tax
carryforwards of individual Mexican subsidiaries. In 1998, the Company
completely reduced this valuation allowance because it expected that income
levels for such subsidiaries would be sufficient to fully utilize such credits.
Additionally, during 1998 the Company recorded a valuation allowance in the
amount of $723,800 relating to Optimag U.S. net operating losses. Optimag was
sold in 1999, and accordingly the related valuation allowance has been
eliminated. The valuation allowance of $1,313,576 at December 31, 1999 was
recorded during 1999 and relates primarily to certain asset tax carryforwards of
individual Mexican subsidiaries.
During 1999, Precision recorded deferred tax liabilities of $2,392,000
related principally to differences in the financial statement carrying amount
and the tax basis of fixed assets at the date of acquisition.
The asset taxes paid, adjusted for inflation, may be used to offset income
taxes that exceed the assets tax due for the year, for ten years following the
payment of the tax. These asset tax carryforwards as of December 31, 1999 are $1,433,246 and expire from 2000
through 2009.
At December 31, 1999, certain of the Mexican companies within the
consolidated group had tax net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized
only by the Mexican company that incurred the losses. These net operating loss
carryforwards, adjusted for inflation, expire as follows, if not utilized to
offset taxable income       Year             Amount
2002            $ 481,337
2003             125,724

2008            1,477,451

Total           $5,303,563
The majority stockholder has filed a consolidated tax return with the
Company operations since 1995. The tax sharing agreement entered into between
the majority stockholder, Accel S.A. de C.V., and Elamex provides that Elamex
will transfer monthly an amount equal to its estimated tax payment, less
credits. The payments are calculated as required by the Mexican tax authority as
if Elamex and subsidiaries were filing a stand-alone income tax return for such
year. The majority stockholder further agrees to reimburse Elamex for use of any
of Elamex tax benefits at the time Elamex would otherwise realize the benefit.
Dividends paid by Mexican companies which exceed earnings and profits, as
defined by the Mexican income tax law, are subject to a 34% income tax during
1998 and 35% income tax during 1999, payable by the Company, on 1515 and 15385
times the amount in excess of earnings and profits during 1998 and 1999,
respectively. Dividends paid which do not exceed earnings and profits are not
currently subject to Mexican tax to either the Company or the stockholder. The
Mexican companies paid no dividends on common stock in 1999, 1998, or 1997. 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Common Stock - During 1998 and 1997, a subsidiary of the Company purchased
515,400 and 18,500 shares, respectively, of the Company common stock in the
open market for an aggregate amount of $2,303,132 and $215,000, respectively.
This treasury stock has been presented in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets at cost as a reduction of stockholders' equity.
Under the bylaws and Mexican law, the capital stock of Elamex, S.A. de
C.V. must consist of fixed capital and may have, in addition thereto, variable
capital. Stockholders holding shares representing variable capital common stock
may require the Company, with a notice of at least three months prior to
December 31 of the prior year, to redeem those shares at a price equal to the
lesser of either i 95% of the market price, based on the average of trading
prices in the stock exchange where it is listed during the 30 trading days
preceding the end of the fiscal year in which the redemption is to become
effective or ii the book value of the Company shares as approved at the
meeting of stockholders for the latest fiscal year prior to the redemption date.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had not issued any of its authorized variable
capital common stock. Although the variable capital common stock is redeemable
by the terms described above, such shares would be classified as a component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the
variable common stock represents permanent capital because the timing and
pricing mechanisms through which a stockholder would exercise this option to
redeem are such that a stockholder, from an economic standpoint, would not
exercise this option. At the time a stockholder is required to give notice of
redemption, the stockholder will not be able to know at what price the shares
would be redeemed and would not expect the present value of the future
redemption payment to equal or exceed the amount which would be received by the
stockholder in an immediate public sale.
Under Mexican law, dividends must be declared in pesos. If dividends are
declared in the future, the Company intent is to pay the dividends to all
stockholders in U.S. dollars, as converted from pesos as of the date of record,
unless otherwise instructed by the stockholder.
Mexican law requires that at least 5% of the Company net income each
year after profit sharing and other deductions required by the law be
allocated to a legal reserve fund, which is not thereafter available for
distribution, except as a stock dividend, until the amount of such fund equals
20% of the Company historical capital stock. The legal reserve fund at
December 31, 1999 and 1998 was approximately $1,363,000. The Company anticipates
an additional allocation will be made at its annual stockholders' meeting to be
held on April 21, 2000 of approximately $269,000. Retained earnings available
for dividends under Mexican law at December 31, 1999 were $3,773,000. However,
debt agreements place certain restrictions on the payment of dividends see Note
6.
Common Stock Purchase Restrictions and Preemptive Rights - Any person who
seeks to acquire ownership of 15% or more of the total outstanding shares of the
Company common stock must receive written consent from the Company Board of
Directors. Should shares in excess of 15% be acquired without permission, the
purchaser will be subject to liquidated damages, which will be used by the
Company to repurchase stock in excess of the 15% ownership limitation. In
addition, in the event that the Company issues additional shares, existing
stockholders will have a preemptive rights to subscribe for new shares, except
when shares are issued in connection with a merger or for the conversion of
convertible debentures. The 15,000,000 shares of variable capital are not
subject to preemptive rights.
Preferred Stock - Pursuant to the Company bylaws, the Company Board of
Directors, at its discretion, can issue up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series. The Board may attach any preferences,
rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions to the shares of each
series issued, including dividend rights and rates, conversion rights, voting
rights, terms of redemption, and liquidation preferences. The shares may be
issued at no par value or at a par value determined by the Board of Directors.
No shares of preferred stock have been issued as of December 31, 1999.
10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company maintains an Executive Phantom Stock Plan the Plan which
offers certain key executives of the Company and related entities long-term
incentives in addition to their current compensation. Participants receive
benefits expressed in shares of common stock, but which are not actual shares of
common stock Phantom Stock Shares. A participant may exercise the right to
receive payment for Phantom Stock Shares two years after the determination date
as defined in the Plan; however, such shares expire after ten years. Upon
termination of employment for cause, Phantom Stock Shares and accrued dividends
and interest are forfeited.
The Company keeps a record of the amount of Phantom Stock Shares held by
each participant. Each participant is credited with dollar amounts equal to
dividends paid on issued and outstanding common stock, and such amounts accrued
interest at the short-term money market rate published by Chase Manhattan Bank,
N.A. The Plan provides that the number of Phantom Stock Shares awarded be
determined by a committee of the Board of Directors charged with administering
the Plan, and the aggregate number of Phantom Stock Shares awarded for any year
shall in no event exceed 10% of the number of the Company issued and
outstanding common shares as of the end of such year. For the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, the Company recorded $80,000, $0, and
$224,000, respectively, in expense under the Phantom Stock Plan.
Transactions involving the plan are summarized as follows                         Phantom Stock Shares
1999     1998
Outstanding January 1        30,980    30,980
Granted

Exercised              2,088
Exercisable December 31       28,892    30,980
The Company sponsors two 401k defined contribution plans. Participants
in the plans may contribute up to 10% of their salary for which the Company
provides matching or discretionary contributions. In 1999, the first year the
Company sponsored the plans, approximately $87,000 was charged to expense.
11. MAJOR CUSTOMERS
The Company has agreements that provide for the sale of its assembly
service and turnkey manufacturing at established prices. The Company business
is dependent on one- to five-year agreements, which are subject to termination
or renewal.    Certain customers, all of which are located in the United States,
accounted for at least 10% of the Company total sales during the periods ended
as follows    Customer      Products and Services         1999  1998  1997

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various claims, actions, and complaints, the
ultimate disposition of which, in the opinion of management, will not have a
material adverse effect on the operations or financial position of the Company.
The Mexican Federal Labor Law requires a severance payment for all
permanent employees that are terminated by the employer. This payment is
calculated on the basis of 90-days' pay for termination anytime during the first
year of employment, with an additional 12 days per pay year for each year of
service thereafter up to two times minimum wage. While most of the Company
Mexican assembly labor is hired under temporary labor contracts during the first
two months of employment, the labor force is changed to permanent labor
contracts after this period. The Company has agreements with many of its
contract-assembly customers which require that the customers pay the severance
costs incurred, in the event that assembly contracts are terminated prior to
their scheduled completion. In management opinion, any severance costs
incurred upon the termination of any manufacturing contracts would not be
material.
Seniority premiums to which employees are entitled upon retirement after
15 years or more of service, in accordance with the Mexican Federal Labor Law,
are recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered, based
on actuarial computations. Included in other liabilities is approximately
$208,000 and $347,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, which
fully accrues for these estimated seniority obligations. No significant
seniority payments have been made through December 31, 1999.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has an obligation to purchase inventory
held by suppliers valued at approximately $3,138,000. 14. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED
