Item 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
WE MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT
INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS IS RECORDED,
PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND FORMS AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION
IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW FOR TIMELY
DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. IN DESIGNING AND EVALUATING THE
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT ANY CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY
REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES, AND MANAGEMENT
IS REQUIRED TO APPLY ITS JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE COST-BENEFIT RELATIONSHIP OF
POSSIBLE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
AS REQUIRED BY SEC RULE 13A-15B, WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION, UNDER THE
SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF
EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF JUNE 30,
2003. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL
OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AT
THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL.
THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
DURING OUR MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS
REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING. -41
