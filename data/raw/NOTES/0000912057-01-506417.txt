flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

CIPHERGEN BIOSYSTEMS,INC.   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company  Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. the Company, which was reincorporated in the State of Delaware of June21, 2000, develops, manufactures and sells
ProteinChip Systems, which consist of disposable ProteinChip Arrays, ProteinChip Readers and ProteinChip Software for life science researchers. These products are primarily sold to biologists at
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government research laboratories.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements for 1999 and 1998 include the accounts of the Company and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries. In February
2000, the Company established a new subsidiary in Denmark, which is included in the consolidated financial statements for 2000. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Company reports its minority ownership interest in Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K., a joint venture in Japan, using the equity method of accounting. Intercompany profits have been
eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain Risks and Uncertainties  The Company products and services are currently concentrated in a single segment of the life science research field which is characterized by rapid
technological advances and changes in customer requirements. The success of the Company depends on management ability to anticipate or to respond quickly and adequately to technological developments
in its industry, changes in customer requirements or industry standards. Any significant delays in the development or introduction of products or services could have a material adverse effect on the
Company business and operating results. 
The
Company licenses certain technologies that are used in products that represent substantially all of its revenues. An inability to retain such technology licenses could result in a
material adverse effect to the Company. Additionally, some of the components used in its products are from single-source suppliers. If the Company is unable to obtain such components, its financial
condition and operating results could be significantly impacted.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
34  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximate fair value due to
their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of its debt obligations approximates fair value.  Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Most
of the Company cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2000 were deposited with financial institutions in the United States and exceeded federally insured amounts. The Company also
maintains minimal cash deposits with banks in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Denmark and Canada. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. The
Company accounts receivable are derived from sales made to customers located in North America, Europe and Asia. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition
and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Ciphergen
Biosystems, K.K. accounted for 11% of revenue in both 2000 and 1999. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2000 or 1999.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market value.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Computer
equipment is depreciated over three years, laboratory equipment over five years, office furniture and equipment over three to five years, and demonstration
equipment over two years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lease term. Gains and losses upon asset disposal are reflected in operations in the year of disposition.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Intangible assets arose from the Company acquisitions. Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. Other intangible
assets consisted of acquired workforce, which was amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three years.  Long-lived Assets  Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the asset carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Revenue from product
sales is recognized upon product 
35  shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collections of the receivables are deemed probable. Revenue from research contracts is recognized as the work is performed. The Company
recognizes revenue for ongoing maintenance contracts ratably over the period of the service contract. Licensing product and distribution rights are recognized ratably over the term of such agreements.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Software is an integral component to our product and is not sold separately except
as part of ongoing maintenance contracts. Software development costs incurred in the research and development of new products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established.
To date, products and upgrades have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25
APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB 25, unearned compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise price. Unearned
compensation is amortized and expensed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No28. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123 and Emerging Issue Task Force No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are the local currencies. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are
translated into U.S. dollars at current period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. The gains and
losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries'
financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders' equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses
have not been significant.  Net Loss per Share  Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders for the period by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common
stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period, if their effect is dilutive. Potential common shares include common
stock subject to repurchase and incremental 
36  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and upon the conversion of convertible preferred stock. The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated in thousands, except per share

June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and for
Hedging Activities SFAS 133 which provides a comprehensive and consistent standard for hedging activities. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 which
defers the
effective date of SFAS 133 to years beginning after June15, 2000. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of SFAS 133 will have an impact on its results of operations or financial
condition.

In January1999, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with a Japanese company to forma limited liability corporation, Ciphergen
Biosystems, K.K., to be incorporated under the commercial code of Japan. The Company invested $315,000 in exchange for 30% ownership of the joint venture. The Company has no future funding commitments
to Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K. Commencing after the fiscal year ending December31, 2001, the Company has the option to purchase, based on a predetermined formula price, an aggregate of 40% of
Ciphergen Biosystems, K.K. from its joint venture partner each year within 30days of the receipt of the joint venture audited financial statements. Such buyout option terminates
automatically 30days after the receipt of the joint venture audited financial statements for the year ending December31, 2004. The Japanese partner is obligated to provide or arrange
for working capital for the joint venture until the Company purchases the additional 40% ownership, at which time the joint venture must repay such financing and arrange its own working capital
financing. The Company proportionate share of the joint venture losses were recorded in the statement of operations as non-operating losses. Approximately 11% of the Company revenues
in both 2000 and 1999 were from sales to the joint venture. 
In
connection with the joint venture agreement, the Company entered into a distribution and marketing agreement with the joint venture whereby the joint venture would distribute the
Company products in the life science research markets in Japan. In exchange for providing trading, technical support, equipment demonstrations and seminars, the Company received a
non-refundable payment of
approximately $315,000. Such payment is included in deferred revenue and is being recognized as other income over a 10-year period, the term of the joint venture agreement.

As

Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Ciphergen Technologies, Inc. and IllumeSys Pacific, Inc. v. Molecular Analytical Systems, Inc., LumiCyte, Inc. and T. William
Hutchens.On July12, 2000, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California against Molecular Analytical Systems, Inc.
MAS and LumiCyte, Inc. LumiCyte requesting a declaration that Ciphergen has the right to sell information and service products, including through its Biomarker Discovery Centers, and
requesting a preliminary injunction preventing MAS from terminating the sublicense agreements. In October2000, the Company made additional claims against MAS and LumiCyte, and added T. William
Hutchens as an individual defendant. Dr.Hutchens is the Chief Executive Officer of both MAS and LumiCyte, a former officer and director of Ciphergen, and is the beneficial owner of
approximately 121% of the Company outstanding common stock. Ciphergen action seeks, among other things, damages and injunctive relief against defendants for unfair competition, misappropriation
of trade secrets, and breach of contract, as well as an injunction precluding defendants from operating in Ciphergen licensed markets. In October 2000, MAS and LumiCyte filed a cross-complaint
against Ciphergen, Ciphergen Technologies,Inc. and IllumeSys Pacific,Inc., the three plaintiffs which filed the underlying lawsuit against MAS and LumiCyte described above. The
cross-complaint alleges claims for breach of contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets and declaratory relief
regarding the rights of the parties under the 
41  two technology transfer sublicense agreements between MAS and Ciphergen. The cross-complaint also seeks to terminate the sublicense agreements, to obtain injunctive relief, to prevent use of alleged
trade
secrets of MAS, and damages. Ciphergen and MAS have entered into an agreement that provides that MAS license termination notices are suspended pending the conclusion of this lawsuit. Molecular Analytical Systems, Inc. v. Ciphergen Biosystems.The proceeding was filed December9, 1999 in the
United States Trademark and Appeal Board. The Company has applied for registration of the term SELDI as a trademark. MAS has opposed registration of the trademark and is seeking to have the
trademark registered in its name, instead. The Trademark and Appeal Board has suspended the proceedings until resolution of the lawsuit described above. 
Although
the ultimate outcome of these matters is not presently determinable, management believes that the resolution of all such pending matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, should the outcome of these matters be unfavorable to the Company, the impact could be material
to the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. 
7.Stockholders' Equity Deficit  Stock Split  On September26, 2000 the board of directors and stockholders approved a 043-for-1 reverse stock split of the common and preferred stock. All share and
per share amounts for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively.  Initial Public Offering  The Company had its initial public offering IPO of 5,500,000 shares of common stock on September28, 2000 at a price of $16 per share. On
October3, 2000 the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock. The IPO generated aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
$1012million for the Company. The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $924million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately
$71million and expenses of the offering of approximately $17million. Concurrent with the IPO, all of the Company preferred stock and preferred stock warrants automatically
converted to common stock and common stock warrants, respectively.  Convertible Preferred Stock  In February1995, the Company entered into a joint development agreement with Stanford Research Systems which was amended in June 2000. It provides for
the issuance of a total of 949,113 shares of SeriesB preferred stock. Under this agreement, 476,113 shares of SeriesB preferred stock at $233 per share were issued upon the closing of
the Company SeriesB financing in March1995, 118,250 shares were issued in October1996 upon the achievement of the first milestone, and 118,250 shares were issued in
September1997 upon the achievement of the second milestone. In June 2000 and November 2000, additional milestones were attained and 25,800 shares of SeriesB preferred stock valued at
$379,000 and 12,900shares of common stock valued at $142,000 were issued, respectively. The remaining 197,800 shares will be issued as common stock upon the achievement of additional
milestones. 
In
March 2000, the Company issued 4,468,070 shares of SeriesE preferred stock SeriesE at $6395 per share resulting in net cash proceeds of $269million.
The difference between the conversion price and the fair market value per share of the common stock on the transaction date resulted in a beneficial conversion feature of $267million which
has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in the consolidated financial statements. In connection with the SeriesE financing, the Company issued 
42  the underwriter warrants to purchase 63,053 shares of SeriesE preferred stock for $6395 per share. The warrants had a fair value of $832 per share based on a calculation using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the time of issuance. The aggregate amount allocated to the warrants based on the relative value of the warrants to the SeriesE preferred stock was
$213,000. In March 2000, the underwriters exercised the 63,053 warrants. The resulting difference between the exercise price of the warrants and fair market value of the common stock underlying the
SeriesE preferred stock resulted in an additional beneficial conversion feature of $542,000 on the date these warrants were exercised. This has been reflected as a preferred stock dividend in
the consolidated financial statements. 
43  8.Stock Options, Warrants and Employee Stock Purchase Plan  1993 Stock Option Plan  The Company has reserved 3,493,750shares of common stock for sale to employees, directors and consultants under its 1993 Stock Option Plan the

are exercisable when granted and such unvested shares are subject to repurchase upon termination of employment. Should the employment of the holders of common stock subject to repurchase terminate
prior to full vesting of the outstanding shares, the Company may repurchase all unvested shares at a price per share equal to the original exercise price. At December31, 2000, a total of
approximately 505,000 shares of common stock were subject to repurchase by the Company at a weighted average repurchase price of $210 per share. Unexercised options generally expire ten years from
the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the Company common stock.  2000 Stock Plan  In April 2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Stock Plan the New Plan. The Company has reserved 1,075,000 shares of common stock for sale to employees,
directors and consultants under this new stock option plan. Under the New Plan, options may be granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of the common stock for

expected average life is based on the assumption that stock options on average are exercised 5years after they are granted. The risk-free interest rate was
calculated in accordance with the grant date and expected average life. The exercise price of all options granted during the three years ended December31, 2000 was less than the market value
of the underlying stock on the respective grant dates. The weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $1232, $026 and $016 per
share, respectively. 
45  Stock-Based Compensation  During the period from April1997 through December31, 2000, the Company recorded $246 million of stock-based compensation in accordance with
APB 25, SFAS123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18, related to stock options granted to consultants and employees. For options granted to consultants, the Company determined the
fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected lives of five years; weighted average risk-free rate between 54% and 62 expected dividend yield of zero percent; volatility of 75% and deemed values of common stock between $070 and $1467 per share. Stock compensation expense is being recognized in accordance with FIN
28, an accelerated amortization method, over the vesting periods of the related options, generally five years. 
The
allocation of stock-based compensation expense by functional area was as follows in thousands: Years Ended December 31 2000

Warrants exercised
after the Company initial public offering were exercised for common stock. At December31, 2000, the Company had 9,010 common stock warrants outstanding at a weighted average exercise price
of $354 per share.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan  In April 2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company through
payroll deductions. Purchases are made semi-annually at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering commencement date or 85% of the closing price at the end of
the purchase period. The Company has reserved 215,000shares of common stock for issuance to employees under this Plan. There was no activity under this plan in 2000. 
46  9.Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the current tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts expected to be realized. 
Based
on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has
provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2000.
