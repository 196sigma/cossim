As a result of our limited operating history and the emerging nature of the
market for web content management software and services in which we compete, it
is difficult for us to forecast our revenues or earnings accurately. It is
possible that in some future periods our results of operations may not meet or
exceed the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this
occurs, the price of our common stock is likely to decline. Factors that have
caused our results to fluctuate in the past, and we likely to cause
fluctuations in the future, include. the size of customer orders and the timing of product and service
deliveries. variability in the mix of products and services sold. our ability to retain our current customers and attract new customers. the amount and timing of operating costs relating to expansion of our
business, including our planned international expansion. the announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or
our competitors. our ability to attract and retain personnel, particularly management,
engineering and sales personnel and technical consultants. our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to
accommodate our growth; and. costs related to acquisition of technologies or businesses.
In addition, our products are typically shipped when orders are received, so
license backlog at the beginning of any quarter in the past has represented
only a small portion of expected license revenues for that quarter. Moreover,
we typically recognize a substantial percentage of revenues in the last month
of the quarter, frequently in the last week or even the last days of the
quarter. As a result, at the beginning of a quarter we have no assurance about
the levels of sales in that quarter, and the delay or cancellation of any large
orders can result in a significant shortfall from anticipated revenues. These
factors make license revenues in any quarter difficult to forecast. Since our
expenses are relatively fixed in the near term, any shortfall from anticipated
revenues could result in significant variations in operating results from
quarter to quarter and harm to our business.
As a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not
be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.
