MANAGEMENTS REPORT
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based
on managements assessment using the COSO criteria, management has concluded
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006.
Managements
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in its report which is included herein.

61 REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Advent
Software,Inc. We have completed integrated audits of Advent Software,Inc.s
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based
on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under a1present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Advent Software,Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2006 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2presents
fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of
financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in
Note1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January1,
2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
Internal control
over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 8, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment
andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 62 A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies
Business
description: Advent Software,Inc. Advent
or the Company provides stand-alone and client/server software products,
data and data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate,
integrate and support certain mission-critical functions of the front, middle
and back offices of investment management organizations. Advents clients vary
significantly in size and assets under management and include investment
advisors, brokerage firms, banks, hedge funds, corporations, public funds,
foundations, universities and non-profit organizations.
Basis
of presentation: The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Advent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany transactions and amounts have been eliminated.
Year
End: Advents fiscal year ends on December31st.
Foreign
currency translation: The functional currency of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies. All assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign functional currencies are translated into
U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues, costs and
expenses in foreign functional currencies are translated at the average rate of
exchange during the period.
Foreign
currency measurement: Asset and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are re-measured
into the functional currency with gains or losses recorded in interest income
and other, net on the consolidated statement of operations.
Use
of estimates: The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Advent
believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant
judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements: Goodwill; Revenue Recognition; Income Taxes; Restructuring Charges
and Related Accruals; Impairment of Long-Lived Assets; Legal Contingencies;
Sales Returns and Accounts Receivable Allowances; and Stock-Based Compensation.
Fair
value of financial instruments: The amounts
reported for cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and accounts
payable are considered to approximate their market values based on comparable
market information available at the respective balance sheet dates and their
short-term nature.
Cash
and cash equivalents: Cash equivalents are
comprised of highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining
maturity of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. These securities are
maintained with major financial institutions.
Marketable
securities: All of Advents marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value.
The unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effect, are reported in
accumulated comprehensive income in stockholders equity in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements, with the exception of Advents broker/dealer
subsidiary, which reports unrealized gains and losses in interest income and
other, net on the consolidated statement of operations. Realized gains and
losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on
available-for-sale securities are also included in interest income and other,
net. 68  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Investments: Investments
are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and included in other assets
on the consolidated balance sheets and consist of non-marketable investments in
privately held companies, most of which can be considered in the start-up or
development stages. It is Advents policy to review investments in privately
held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic
viability of these companies. This policy includes, but is not limited to,
reviewing each of the companies cash position, financing needs,
earnings/revenue outlook, operational performance, management/ownership changes
and competition. The evaluation process is based on information that Advent
requests from these privately held companies. This information is not subject
to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as
such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to timing and the accuracy of
the data received from these companies.
The Companys investments in privately held companies
are assessed for impairment when a review of the investees operations
indicates that a decline in value of the investment is other than temporary.
Such indicators include, but are not limited to, limited capital resources,
limited prospects of receiving additional financing, and prospects for
liquidity of the related securities. Impaired investments in privately held companies
are written down to estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value
using a variety of valuation methodologies. Such methodologies include
comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines
of business, applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results
for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company.
Product
development: Product development expenses
consist primarily of salary, benefits and stock-based compensation for the
Companys development and technical support staff, contractors fees and other
costs associated with the enhancements of existing products and services and
development of new products and services. Costs incurred for software
development prior to technological feasibility are expensed as product
development costs in the period incurred. Once the point of technological
feasibility isreached, which is generally the completion of a working
prototype that has no critical bugs and is a release candidate, development
costs are capitalized until the product is ready for general release and are
classified other intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company amortizes capitalized software development costs using the greater
of the ratio of the products current gross revenues to the total of current
expected gross revenues or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic
life of the related product, which is typically three years.
Capitalization
of internal use software: Certain costs related
to computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in
accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of
Position No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. The Company amortizes internal use
software costs over their estimated useful lives, which typically range from
two to five years. Costs of $28 million, $12 million and $403,000 related to
the development of internal use software were capitalized in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, and are included in property and equipment, net on the
consolidated balance sheets.
Additionally, Advent capitalizes certain costs
incurred for web site design and development in accordance with Emerging Issue
Task Force No00-2, Accounting for Web Site Development costs.
These costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which typically
range from two to five years. Web site design and development costs of $221,000
and $108,000 were capitalized in 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no
website development costs capitalized in 2006.
Property and equipment: Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Advent calculates depreciation and amortization using the
straight-line method over the  69  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued assets estimated useful lives. Amortization of
leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.
The cost and related accumulated depreciation applicable to property and
equipment sold or no longer in service are eliminated from the accounts and any
gains or losses are generally included in operating expenses. Useful lives by
principal classifications are as follows 
Computer
equipment and software
1 to
6 years
Leasehold
improvements
2
years to end of lease term
Furniture and
fixtures
3 to
5 years
Telephone system
1 to 10 years
Repairs and maintenance expenditures, which are not
considered improvements and do not extend the useful life of the property and
equipment, are expensed as incurred.
Accounting
for long-lived assets: Advent reviews goodwill
for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as of November1
and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment
loss has occurred. Advent is required to test goodwill for impairment at the
reporting unit level. Advent has determined that its operations were organized
into three reporting units as of November1, 2006. The test for goodwill
impairment is a two-step process The first step compares the fair value of each
reporting unit with its respective carrying amount, including goodwill. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the
reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the
impairment test is unnecessary.
The second step, used to measure the amount of
impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of each reporting units
goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that
excess.
The process for evaluating the potential impairment of
goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test
including future revenue forecasts, discount rates and various reporting unit
allocations. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Advent completed the first step
of its annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment. Therefore, the
second step of the impairment test was not necessary to perform.
Advent also reviews
its other long-lived assets including property and equipment and other
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Factors the
Company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include
the following significant
underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating
results significant
changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the
overall business significant
negative market or economic trends significant
decline in the Companys stock price for a sustained period; and
market
capitalization relative to net book value. 70  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the
assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized
is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value.
Other
intangible assets mainly represent completed technology, distributor licenses,
customer lists, trade names acquired in business combinations, and capitalized
software development costs. Identifiable intangibles are amortized on a
straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows

Revenue
recognition: Advent recognizes revenue from
software licenses, development fees, maintenance, other recurring revenues,
professional services and other revenues. In addition, Advent earns commissions
from customers who use the Companys broker/dealer, Second Street Securities,
to soft dollar the purchase of Advent and non-Advent products and services with
soft dollars. Soft dollaring enables the customers to use the commissions
earned on trades to pay all or part of the fees owed to the Company for
non-Advent products or services, which are initially paid for by Second Street
Securities. The commission revenues earned from soft dollar purchases of
non-Advent products or services are recorded as other revenues in professional
services and other revenues on the Companys consolidated statements of
operations.
Advent offers a wide variety of products and services
to a large number of financially sophisticated customers. While many of the
Companys lower-priced license transactions, maintenance contracts,
subscription-based transactions and professional services projects conform to a
standard structure, many of Advents larger transactions are complex and may
require significant review and judgment in Advents application of generally
accepted accounting principles.
Software
license and development fees. Advent recognizes
revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the fee is fixed or
determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Advent
generally uses a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement. Sales
through the Companys distributors are evidenced by a master agreement
governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed
contracts from the distributors customers. Revenue is recognized once shipment
to the distributors customer has taken place and when all other revenue
recognition criteria have been met. Delivery occurs when product is delivered
to a common carrier F.O.B shipping point. Some of Advents arrangements include
acceptance provisions, and if such acceptance provisions are provided, delivery
is deemed to occur upon acceptance. Advent assesses whether the fee is fixed or
determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. The
Company assesses whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is
probable based on a number of factors, including the credit worthiness of the
customer determined through review of credit reports, Advents transaction
history with the customer, other available information and pertinent country
risk if the customer is located outside the United States. Advents standard
payment terms are due at 180 days or less unless the transaction is part of a
soft dollar arrangement through the Companys in-house broker/dealer
subsidiary, Second Street Securities, for which payment is then required within
one year; however, payment terms may vary based on the country in which the
agreement is executed. Software licenses are sold with maintenance and,
frequently, professional services. 71  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Licenses. Advent has continued its transition from selling
mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of perpetual and term contracts, and
expects term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total license
revenue in the future. Advent recognized approximately 49%, 25% and 11% of
license revenue from term licenses and incremental AUA fees during fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue recognition for software licensed under
perpetual and term-based license models differs depending on which type of contract
a customer signs Perpetual licenses
Advent allocates revenue to delivered components,
normally the license component of the arrangement, using the residual method,
based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the
undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services
components, which is specific to Advent. Advent determines the fair value of
the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the Companys
stand-alone sales of these elements to third parties. If VSOE of fair value
does not exist for any undelivered elements, then the entire arrangement fee is
deferred until delivery of that element has occurred.
Term licenses
Term license contract prices include both the software
license fees and maintenance fees, and, as a result, Advent allocates 55% of
the contract price to license revenue and 45% to maintenance and recurring
revenues, based on the Companys assessment of the relative economic value of
the two elements.
To date, Advent has offered multi-year term licenses
by which a customer makes a binding commitment to license the software for a
fixed multi-year termtypically three years. For multi-year term licenses the
Company has not established VSOE of fair value for the term license and
maintenance components, and, as a result, in situations where the Company is
also performing related professional services, Advent defers all revenue and
directly related expenses under the arrangement until the professional services
are substantially complete. At the point professional services are
substantially completed, the Company recognizes a pro rata amount of the term
license and maintenance revenue, professional services fees earned and related
expenses, based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the
substantial completion of professional services. The remaining deferred
professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over
the remaining contract length. Term license and maintenance revenue for the
remaining contract years is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the
contract. When multi-year term licenses are sold and do not include related
professional services, Advent recognizes the entire term license and
maintenance revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the
effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition
criteria have been met.
Advent occasionally offers single-year term licenses.
Revenue on delivered components will be allocated and recognized, based on
vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value of the elements
license, maintenance and professional services components, which is specific
to the Company. While fair value of the undelivered professional services
component is based on the historical evidence of the Companys stand-alone
sales of these components to third parties, VSOE for the term license and the
related maintenance components will be determined by the stated optional
renewal rate. If VSOE of fair value does not exist for any undelivered
elements, then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that
element has occurred. 72  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Development fees are derived from contracts that
Advent has entered into with other companies, including customers and development
partners. Agreements for which the Company receives development fees normally
provide for the development of technologies and products that are expected to
become part of Advents general product offerings in the future. Revenues for
license development projects are recognized primarily using the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting, based on costs incurred to date
compared with the estimated cost of completion, or using the completed contract
method, when the development project is finished.
Certain of our perpetual and term license contracts
contain fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets
that the client manages using our software Assets Under Administration or AUA.
Contracts containing an AUA fee structure have a defined measurement period
which requires the client to self report actual AUA in arrears of the specified
period. AUA fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are
considered incremental fees. Because incremental fees are not determinable
until the conclusion of the measurement period, they are both earned and
recognized in arrears, on a quarterly or annual basis.
If a customer purchased Advents software and chose to
enter into a soft dollar arrangement through our in-house broker/dealer
subsidiary, Second Street Securities, the soft dollar arrangement did not
change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written
contract. The customer is required to pay the original fee for the Companys
software within one year. If insufficient trading volume is generated to pay
the entire original fee within one year, the customer is still required to
render payment within one year. If the customer chooses to use a third-party
broker/dealer, the original payment terms apply, regardless of the arrangement
with the third-party broker/dealer. The option to soft dollar a transaction
does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction; all the
revenue recognition criteria listed in the Software license section above
must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized.
Advents standard practice is to enforce its contract
terms and not allow its customers to return software.Advent has, however,
allowed customers to return software on a limited case-by-case basis and have
recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales
return becomes probable, in accordance with FASB Statement No48, Revenue
Recognition when Right of Return Exists. The estimates for returns are
adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related
factors.
The Company does have two situations where it provides
a contractual limited right of return to end-user customers only: in
shrink-wrap license agreements for Advent products, and certain MicroEdge
products.The shrink-wrap license agreement for Advent products provides
for a right of return within seven days of delivery of the
software.Certain MicroEdge software license agreements allow for either a
thirty-day money back guarantee or a seven-day right of return. Advent
recognizes revenue on delivery since the fee is fixed or determinable, the
buyer is obligated to pay, the risk of loss passes to the customer, and the
Company has the ability to estimate returns.Advents ability to estimate
returns is based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous
transactions and the fact that the return period is short. Advent has an
algorithm for calculating the value of reserves that takes the previous 18
months of experience into account. Advent has recorded a sales returns
provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based
on our historical experience of $05 million, $02 million and $03million
in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 73  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Maintenance
and other recurring revenues. Advent offers
annual maintenance programs that provide for technical support and updates to
the Companys software products. Maintenance fees are bundled under perpetual
licenses in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of
annual maintenance in subsequent years. Fair value for maintenance is based
upon renewal rates stated in the contracts or, in limited cases, separate sales
of renewals to other customers. Generally, Advent recognizes maintenance
revenue ratably over the contract term, except in the case of multi-year term
license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above.
Revenues from term licenses represented approximately 6%, 3% and 1% of
maintenance and other recurring revenue during 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Advent offers other recurring revenue services that
are either subscription-based or transaction-based, and primarily include the
provision of software interfaces to, and the capability to download securities
information from, third party data providers. The Company recognizes revenue
from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period
or as the transactions occur.
Based on the Companys historical experience, Advent
has recorded sales benefit to increase revenues for estimated returns for
maintenance and other recurring revenues of $12 million, $03 million and
$09million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Advent has an
algorithm for calculating the value of reserves that takes the last 18 months
of experience into account, which resulted in the above adjustments to revenue.
Professional
services and other revenues. Advent offers a
variety of professional services that include project management,
implementation, data conversion, integration, custom report writing and
training. Fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of
these services by the Company to other customers. Advents professional
services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement
for travel and accommodation expenses. Advents professional services and other
revenue also include revenue from the Companys annual user conferences. Advent
generally recognizes revenue as these professional services are performed,
except in the case of multi-year term license contracts which are described in
the term licenses section above. Certain professional services arrangements
involve acceptance criteria. In these cases, revenue and related expenses are
recognized upon acceptance.
Commission revenues received from soft dollar
transactions for products and services not related to the Companys products
and services, are recorded as other revenues on a net basis as Advent is not
the primary obligor in these transactions. Revenues from these soft dollar
transactions are recognized on a trade-date basis as securities transactions
occur.
Advents ability to estimate revenue reserves for
professional services is based on a long history of experience with relatively
homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short. The
Company has recorded a reserve to account for these situations based on its
historical experience of $09million, $23 million and $52 million for
fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Directly
related expenses. When
Advent defers service revenues, it also defers the direct costs incurred in the
delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through
the future revenues on non-cancellable contracts. Advent recognizes those
deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and
over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service
revenue. When Advent defers license revenue, the Company defers the direct
incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract i.e. sales
commissions earned by the salesforce as a part of their overall compensation
because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of
that  74  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued contract. Advent
recognizes those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over
the same period as the license revenues.
Allowance
for doubtful accounts and sales returns: Advent
analyzes specific accounts receivable, historical bad debts, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes
in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts. Advent also analyzes customer demand and acceptance of
product and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance
for sales returns, which are not generally provided to customers. Allowances
for sales returns are accounted for as deductions to net revenues and increases
to reserves within deferred revenues.
Advertising
costs: The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and classifies these costs under
sales and marketing expense. Total advertising expenses were $656,000 465,000, and $215,000 for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Stock-based
compensation: Effective
January1, 2006, Advent adopted the provisions of, and accounts for
stock-based compensation in accordance with, the Financial Accounting Standards
Boards FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123revised
2004 SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment which replaced Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25 APB25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under the fair value recognition provisions of this
statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on
the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. The Company
elected to implement this statement using the modified-prospective method,
under which prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes. Under the
modified prospective method, the valuation provisions of SFAS 123R apply to new
grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date. Estimated
compensation expense for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date
will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation
cost estimated for the SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures. Advent makes quarterly
assessments of the adequacy of our tax credit pool to determine if there are
any deficiencies which require recognition in the Companys consolidated
statements of operations.
Advent uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
determine the fair value of stock options, stock appreciation rights SAR
and employee stock purchase plan shares. The fair value of the Companys
restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of Advents
stock on the date of grant. The determination of the fair value of stock-based
payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is
affected by Advents stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of
complex and subjective variables. These variables include Advents expected
stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected
employee exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.
Advent estimates the volatility of the Companys
common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied
volatility of the Companys common stock. Advent determined that a blend of
historical and implied volatility is more reflective of the market conditions
and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical
volatility. The Company estimates the expected life of options and SARs
granted based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration
to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations
of future employee  75  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued behavior. The Company
bases the risk-free interest rate on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at
the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the
option and SAR. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in
the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in
the option pricing model. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on
the Companys historical experience over the last ten years. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred.
The adoption of SFAS 123R had a material impact on
Advents consolidated financial position and results of operations. See Note 9,
Stock Based Compensation, for further information regarding Advents
stock-based compensation assumptions and expense, including pro forma disclosures
for prior periods as if the Company had recorded stock-based compensation
expense.
Restructuring
charges and related accruals: Since 2003, Advent
has developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring the business
to better align its resources to market conditions and recorded significant
charges. In connection with these plans, Advent has recorded estimated expenses
for severance and benefits, lease cancellations, asset write-offs and other
restructuring costs. Given the significance of, and the timing of the execution
of such activities, this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments
of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made, including
evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and
sub-lease rental income. Advent continually evaluates the adequacy of the
remaining liabilities under its restructuring initiatives. Although the Company
believes that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring
plans, actual results may differ, thereby requiring Advent to record additional
provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions.
Income
taxes: Advent accounts for worldwide income
taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future
tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets
and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities. A
valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an
amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company has elected to use the with and without
approach as described in EITF TopicNo.D-32 in determining the
order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, the Company will only
recognize a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital
if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes
currently available to the Company have been utilized. In addition, the Company
has elected to account for the impact of stock-based awards on other tax
attributes, such as the research tax credit, through the consolidated statement
of operations.
During the fourth quarter of 2006, Advent determined
that there was sufficient positive evidence to support a significant decrease
in the Companys valuation allowance. As a result of this release of a majority
of its valuation allowance and recognition of deferred tax assets, Advents
financial statements for fiscal 2006 reflect an increase in assets on its
balance sheet, a decrease in goodwill relating to the recognition of acquired
deferred tax assets that were offset by a valuation allowance in purchase
accounting and a tax benefit to the Companys statement of operations in the
amount of the reversal.
Net
income loss per share: Basic net income loss
per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding for that period. Diluted net income per
share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that
were outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential shares consist of
incremental common shares issuable upon exercise of stock  76  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock units and conversion of preferred
stock none outstanding for all periods, except in situations where inclusion
is anti-dilutive.
Comprehensive
income loss: Comprehensive
income loss consists of net income loss, net unrealized foreign currency
translation adjustments and net unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale marketable securities and is presented in the consolidated
statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income.
Segment
information: The
Company has determined that it has the following two reportable segments: 1
Advent Investment Management, and 2 MicroEdge. Advent Investment Management
derives revenues from the development, marketing and sale of software products,
data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate, integrate
and support certain mission-critical functions of investment management
organizations. MicroEdge derives revenues from the sale of software and
services for grant management, matching gifts and volunteer tracking for the
grantmaking community.
International sales, which are based on the location
to which the product is shipped or services are delivered, represented 12 11%, and 9% of the Companys net revenues for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net revenues
for fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.
Certain
risks and concentrations: Product revenues are concentrated in the investment
management software industry, which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
Significant technological changes in the industry or customer requirements, or
the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities or technologies
could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, Advent derives a
significant portion of its revenues from its Axys, Geneva and Advent Portfolio
Exchange applications and ancillary products and services, and therefore their
market acceptance is essential to the Companys success.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risks comprise, principally, cash,
short-term marketable securities, and trade accounts receivable. Advent invests
excess cash through banks, mutual funds, and brokerage houses primarily in
highly liquid securities and has investment policies and procedures that
minimize credit risk. Advents marketable securities consist of diversified
investment grade securities traded in the United States of America. The Company
believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to
these securities.
With respect to accounts receivable, Advent performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on
customer accounts when deemed necessary. At December31, 2006 and 2005, no
single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable.
Reclassifications: Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Advent
reclassified $12 million in prepaid sales commissions from prepaid expenses
and other to other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31,
2005. Such reclassifications had no effect on the Companys total assets,
results of operations or stockholders equity.
Common
Stock Repurchases: Advent
accounts for common stock repurchases by allocating the cash paid in excess of
par value to additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. The Company
calculates the average additional paid-in capital per outstanding share at the
beginning of each monthly period in which stock was repurchased and records the
difference between the repurchase price per share and the sum of the par value
and average paid-in capital per share as an increase to accumulated deficit. 77 ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In June2006, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.FIN 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income TaxesAn Interpretation of FASB Statement No109,
which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 will be effective beginning in the
first quarter of 2007. Advent does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a
material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.
In September2006, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS
157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS 157 will be
effective in the first quarter of 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of the provisions of SFAS 157.
In September2006, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No108, Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB
108. SAB 108 does not change the staffs previous guidance in SAB 99 on
evaluating the materiality of misstatements. SAB 108 requires companies to
evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial
statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover
approach and the iron curtain approach. The rollover approach quantifies
misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial
statement whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on
the effects of correcting the misstatement in the balance sheet at the end of
the current year, irrespective of the misstatements yearsof origin.
Financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in
quantifying a misstatement that is material. Correcting prior year financial
statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to
be amended. SAB 108 is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year
ending after November15, 2006. The provisions of SAB 108 had no impact on
the Companys consolidated financial statements as of December31, 2006.
In February2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No115, SFAS
159. This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions in
SFAS 159 are elective; however, the amendment to FASB Statement No115, Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, applies to all entities
with available-for-sale and trading securities. The fair value option
established by SFAS 159 permits all entities to choose to measure eligible
items at fair value at specified election dates. A business entity will report
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option amay
be applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions, such as investments
otherwise accounted for by the equity method, bis irrevocable unless a
new election date occurs, and cis applied only to entire arrangements
and not to portions of instruments. SFAS 159 is effective as of the beginning
of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November15, 2007.
Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year
provided that the entity makes that choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal
year and also elects to apply the provisions of SFAS No157. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of SFAS159. 78  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Note 2Marketable

The
gross unrealized losses related to investments are primarily due to a decrease
in the fair value of debt securities as a result of an increase in interest
rates during fiscal 2006. Advent has determined that the gross unrealized
losses on its investments at December31, 2006 are temporary in nature.
Advent regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate
investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent
to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition,
credit quality and  79  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued near-term prospects of the investee, and Advents
ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in market value.

Note 3Acquisitions
and Divestiture
Advent United
Kingdom and Switzerland
On May3, 2004, Advent acquired the remaining
independent distributor businesses from its independent European distributor,
Advent Europe Holding BV Advent Europe, in the United Kingdom and
Switzerland, as well as certain assets of Advent Europe. Advent made these
acquisitions in order to gain direct control over all of its European
operations, which it views as an increasingly important  80  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued market. The consideration
of $60 million consisted of $57 million in cash, $242,000 of assumed
liabilities and $83,000 of closing costs. A total of $55 million of the cash
consideration was paid at closing and the remaining $02 million was paid by
the Company during the second quarter of 2005. In addition, the Company paid an
earn-out distribution of approximately $18 million under a formula based on
revenue bookings, which was recorded as additional goodwill in the second
quarter of 2004. No further earn-out distributions were earned or paid.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the purchase price has been
allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities
acquired on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date.
The amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon managements
estimates using established valuation techniques. The results of operations of
Advent United Kingdom and Advent Switzerland are included in the consolidated
statement of operations subsequent to the acquisition date.
The
allocation of the purchase price for Advent United Kingdom, Advent Switzerland
and certain assets of Advent Europe at the date of purchase was as follows in

Residual goodwill has been
recorded based on the purchase price remaining after allocating the purchase
price to the fair market value of assets purchased less liabilities assumed and
to identifiable intangible assets. Residual goodwill arises as a result of,
among other factors, new customers as well as the implicit value of future cost
savings as a result of the combining of entities. Goodwill resulting from this acquisition
was assigned to the Advent Investment Management segment and was determined to
be non-deductible for tax purposes under Internal Revenue Code 197. 81 ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

to the acquisition of East Circle in December2006. Translation
adjustments of $39 million represent the weakening of the U.S. dollar against
European currencies during fiscal 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the
Company recognized $11million of previously unrecognized state deferred
tax assets purchased with the Kinexus acquisition in 2003. Upon recognition of
this deferred tax asset, the original goodwill from the purchase was reduced.
Translation adjustments of

The intangible asset impairment charges incurred in
fiscal 2004 were associated with the Advent Investment Management reporting
segment.
During 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of $34 million to write off the carrying value of intangible assets
related to the Techfi product line. Of this amount, $10 million was included
in amortization and impairment of developed technology as it related to
existing and core technology and the remaining $24 million was included in
amortization and impairment of other intangibles. In September2004, the
Company decided to discontinue certain products within the Techfi product line,
which was acquired in July2002, as demand for the Techfi product line had
been significantly lower than expected. As a result of this triggering event,
the Company began a review of the recoverability of its Techfi-related
intangible assets. Recoverability was measured by a comparison of the assets
carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows. The
Company determined that these intangible assets had no remaining value and
wrote off the remaining carrying value in 2004.
During 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash impairment
charge of $681,000 to write off the carrying value of intangible assets related
to Advent Wealth Services AWS. Of this amount, $255,000 was included in
amortization and impairment of developed technology as it related to existing
and core technology and the remaining $426,000 was included in operating
expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the combined
triggering events of significant underperformance by AWS relative to historical
and projected future operating results, as well as Advents decision to
re-focus the Companys direction on its core businesses, the Company began a
review of the recoverability of its AWS-related intangible assets.
Recoverability was measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to
their  85  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued expected future
undiscounted net cash flows. The Company determined that these intangible
assets had no remaining value and wrote off the remaining carrying value in
2004.
Also during 2004, Advent recorded a non-cash
impairment charge of $14 million, included in amortization and impairment of
other intangibles, to write off the carrying value of intangible assets related
to Advent Hellas. During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the
triggering event of significant underperformance by Advent Hellas relative to
historical and projected future operating results, the Company began a review
of the recoverability of its Advent Hellas intangible assets. Recoverability
was measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected
future undiscounted net cash flows. The Company determined that these
intangible assets had no remaining value and wrote off the remaining carrying
value in 2004.

Long-term investments include equity investments in
several privately held companies, most of which can still be considered in the
start-up or development stages.
In 2002, Advent acquired approximately 15% of the
outstanding stock of LatentZero Limited LatentZero, a privately-held
company located in the United Kingdom, for $7 million. Through December28,
2004, LatentZero was accounted for under the equity method of accounting as
Advents Chief Executive Officer was a member of LatentZeros board of
directors and Advent accordingly considered itself to have significant
influence over this company. The Companys portion of net loss from this
investee was $257,000 for fiscal 2004. Effective December28, 2004, Advents
Chief Executive Officer resigned her seat on the investees board of directors
and as a result, Advent no longer believes it has significant influence over
LatentZero. Therefore, this investment is carried at the lower of cost or fair
value at December31, 2005 and 2006, consistent with the Companys other
investments.
During
2005, Advent sold one of its private equity investments for proceeds of $38
million resulting in a gain on sale of $36 million. 86 ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

6Restructuring Charges
Restructuring initiatives have been implemented in the
Companys Advent Investment Management and Other operating segments to reduce
costs and improve operating efficiencies by better aligning the Companys
resources to its near-term revenue opportunities. These initiatives have
resulted in restructuring charges comprised primarily of costs related to
properties abandoned in connection with facilities consolidation, related
write-down of leasehold improvements and severance and associated employee
termination costs related to headcount reductions. Advents restructuring
charges included accruals for estimated losses on facility costs based on the
Companys contractual obligations net of estimated sublease income. Advent
reassesses this liability periodically based on market conditions.
For fiscal 2006, Advent recorded total restructuring
charges of $37 million which primarily related to facility and exit costs
associated with the relocation of its
corporate headquarters facility in San Francisco during the fourth quarter of
2006. Restructuring charges in 2006 also included costs associated with exiting
a portion of the Companys facility in New Rochelle, New York, and an entire
facility in Summit,  87  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued NewJersey, and
adjustments to original estimates for facilities in San Francisco, California
and New York, New York.
For fiscal 2005, Advent recorded total restructuring
charges of $20 million consisting of facility and exit costs of $15 million
related to the sub-leasing of one floor of the Companys office in New York,
NewYork and additional charges of $567,000 during 2005 primarily to
adjust original estimates of facility maintenance expenses and real estate
taxes of vacated facilities.
For fiscal 2004, Advent recorded total restructuring
charges of $51 million consisting of $50 million to exit leased facilities 09 million for the write-off of property and equipment, $136,000 for
severance and benefits associated with the termination of nine employees, and
net benefits of $893,000 to adjust original estimates for vacated facilities
and severance charges.

During the fourth quarter
of 2006, management determined that $836 million of deferred tax assets that
had previously been offset by a valuation allowance would more likely than not
be realized in future periods. This assessment was primarily based on the
Companys consistently positive financial results over the previous eight
quarters and a positive income outlook that is supported by recurring revenue
streams. Therefore, the valuation allowance was decreased by $836 million in
the fourth quarter of 2006.
The Company continues to maintain a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets relating to capital losses and
reserves of $93 million and certain state net operating losses of $23 million
due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of the favorable tax
attributes in future tax returns. The capital loss carryforwards expire between
2007 and 2010. If it is determined in the future that it is more likely than
not that these deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance
will be further reduced.
At December31, 2006, Advent had federal net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $118million, which includes
stock-based compensation deductions of $24 million. Utilization of these loss
carryforwards, including losses obtained from acquisitions, is subject to
certain limitations under the federal income tax laws. These net operating loss
carryforwards expire between 2010 and 2024. Also at December31, 2006,
Advent had state net operating loss carryforwards in various states in which it
files tax returns.
Advent also had federal
research credits of $124 million which expire between 2019 and 2026 and California
research credits of $97 million which do not expire.

Indemnifications
As permitted or required
under Delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law, Advent
has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and
directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is,
or was serving, at Advents request in such capacity. These indemnification
obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith
and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
The maximum potential amount of future payments Advent could be required to
make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, Advent has
a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates Advents exposure and
enables Advent to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company
believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is
minimal.
Legal
Contingencies
From time to time, Advent is involved in claims and
legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on
currently available information, management does not believe that the ultimate
outcome of these unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is
likely to have a material adverse effect on Advents financial position or
results of operations. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties
and Advents view of these matters may change in the future. Were an
unfavorable outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact on Advents financial position and results of operations for the
period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future
periods.
On March8, 2005, certain of the former
shareholders of Kinexus and the shareholders representative filed suit against
Advent in the Delaware Chancery Court. The complaint alleges that Advent
breached the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December31, 2001
pursuant to which Advent acquired all of the outstanding shares of Kinexus due
principally to the fact that no amount was paid by Advent on an  91  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued earn-out of up to $115
million. The earn-out, which was payable in cash or stock at the election of
Advent, was based upon Kinexus meeting certain revenue targets in both 2002 and
2003. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, an accounting and
restitution for unjust enrichment. Advent advised the shareholders
representative in January2003 that the earn-out terms had not been met in
2002 and accordingly no earn-out was payable for 2002 and would not be payable
for 2003. Advent disputes the plaintiffs claims and believes that it has
meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend this action. Management
believes that any potential loss associated with this litigation is neither
probable nor reasonably estimable at this time and accordingly has not accrued
any amounts for any potential loss.
On July11, 2006, a
former independent consultant filed suit against Advent in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York. The complaint alleges that Advent failed to pay plaintiff
commissions due for his services as a consultant to Advent. The plaintiff is
seeking approximately $101,000 in commissions and $20million in
unspecified consequential damages, as well as interest and attorneys fees. Advent
disputes the plaintiffs claims and believes that it has meritorious defenses
and intends to vigorously defend this action. Management believes that any
potential loss associated with this litigation is neither probable nor
reasonably estimable at this time and accordingly has not accrued any amounts
for any potential loss.
Note 9Stock-Based
Compensation
Stock-Based
Compensation Expense in Fiscal 2006
Since the adoption of SFAS 123R, there have been no
changes to the Companys equity plans or modifications to outstanding stock-based
awards.
As the stock-based compensation expense recognized on
the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2006 is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest, such amount has been reduced for estimated
forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of
grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on the Companys
historical experience over the last ten years. Previously, under SFAS 123, the
Company recorded forfeitures as they occurred.
Prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, benefits of tax
deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as
operating cash flows. SFAS 123R requires that cash flows resulting from excess
tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a
reduction of taxes paid. 92 ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

2 Represents the
stock-based compensation expense impact from RSUs. During 2006, the Company
changed its employee equity compensation instruments from stock options to
primarily a mix of SARs and RSUs to minimize the dilutive effect from the
Companys equity plans on the Companys common shares outstanding. As a result,
the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense from RSUs during 2006
which would have been recognized under APB 25, regardless of the Companys
adoption of SFAS 123R on January1, 2006.
As of December31,
2006, total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet
recognized under all equity compensation plans, adjusted for estimated
forfeitures, was $245 million and is expected to be recognized through the
remaining vesting period of each grant. As of December31, 2006, the weighted
average remaining period was 31 years.

Valuation
Assumptions
Advent uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
determine the fair value of equity compensation awards stock options,
restricted stock units RSU and stock appreciation rights SAR and
employee stock purchase plan shares, consistent with the provisions of SFAS
123R and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 SAB 107.
The
fair value of each equity award grant is estimated on the date of grant using

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company used
historical volatility in deriving its expected volatility assumption.The
expected stock price volatility for fiscal 2006 was determined based on an
equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the Companys
common stock.Advent determined that a blend of implied volatility and
historical volatility is more reflective of the market  94  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued conditions and a better
indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility. The
expected life for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was determined based on historical
experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the
stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee
behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the
expected life of the option or SAR. The dividend yield assumption is based on
the Companys history of not paying dividends and the resultant future
expectation of zero dividend payouts.
The fair value of RSUs on
the date of grant is the Advent share price.

Description of
Plans
Stock Option Plans
Advent has equity awards outstanding under three stock
option plans, the 2002 Stock Plan the Plan, the 1998 Non-statutory Stock
Option Plan the Non-statutory Plan and the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director
Plan.
The
Plan. On
May18, 2005, the Companys stockholders approved the amendment and
restatement of Advents 2002 Stock Plan, originally approved by the Board of
Directors the Board and stockholders in Februaryand May,
respectively, of 2002. Under the Plan, the Company may grant options to
purchase common stock to employees, consultants and directors. Options granted
may be incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options and shall be
granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date of grant. Fair
market value as defined in the Plan and the vesting of these options shall be
determined by the Board. The options generally vest over 5 years and expire no
later than 10 years from the date of grant. The Company settles employee stock
option exercises with newly issued common shares. The Plan permits the award of
restricted stock, RSUs, SARs, performance shares, and performance units under
the Plan.
During 2006, Advent granted stock-settled RSUs and
SARs. The RSUs are awards of restricted stock units that generally vest over
four years in two equal installments on the second and fourth anniversaries of
the date of grant. Upon vesting, the RSUs will convert into an equivalent
number of shares of common stock. The value of the RSUs is based on the
closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the four-year requisite service period.
A SAR is the right to receive the appreciation in fair market value of common
stock between the exercise date and the date of grant and generally vests over
5 years. Upon exercise, SARs will be settled in shares of Advent common stock.
Unvested RSUs and SARs on termination of employee employment are canceled and
returned to the Plan.
Non-employee directors were eligible to receive option
grants under the Director Plan, which terminated in November2005.
Effective April1, 2005, each non-employee director became eligible to
receive awards under the 2002 Plan of ian initial option grant of
30,000 shares upon joining the Board, which shall vest over four years with 25%
of such shares vesting after one year of service and in equal monthly
installments over the ensuing three years, and iian annual grant of
12,000 shares vesting in twelve equal monthly installments. Upon retirement
from the Board, unvested options are canceled and returned to the Plan.
Effective February26, 2007, each non-employee director became eligible to
receive awards under the 2002 Plan iupon joining the Board, an initial
one-time grant of 21,000 shares of SARs, which vest over four years with 25%
of such shares vesting one year after date of grant and in equal monthly
installments over the ensuing three years, and 4,500 shares of RSU, which vest
over four years with 50% of such shares vesting two years after date of grant
and 50% vesting four years after the date of grant; and iiannual grants
of 8,400 shares of SARs and 1,800 shares of RSUs, which vest 100% one year
after date of grant. Upon retirement from the Board, unvested SARs and RSUs
are canceled and returned to the Plan.
Non-Statutory
Plan. In
November1998, the Board approved the 1998 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan
and reserved 300,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. Under the
Companys 1998 Non-statutory Plan, Advent may grant options to purchase common
stock to employees and consultants, excluding persons who are executive
officers and directors. Options granted are non-statutory stock options and
shall be granted at a price not less than fair market value on the date of
grant. Fair market value as defined in the Non-statutory Plan and the vesting
of these options shall be determined by the  97  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Board. The options
generally vest over 5 years and expire no later than 10 years from the date of
grant. Unvested options on termination of employment are canceled and returned
to the Non-statutory Plan. On February26, 2007, the Board terminated the
Non-statutory Plan.
Director Plan. Advents Director Plan which expired
on November16, 2005, provided for the grant of non-statutory stock
options to the Companys non-employee directors outside directors. As noted
above, effective April1, 2005, option grants to outside directors are
issued under the 2002 Stock Plan.
Warrants
In March2001, the
Company issued a fully vested non-forfeitable stock purchase warrant to
purchase a total of 191,644 shares of Advent common stock to a customer from
whom Advent had revenue of approximately $70,000, $8,000 and $580,000 in 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The warrant was issued for cash consideration of
$5 million, which was the estimated Black-Scholes fair value. The warrant had
an exercise price of $45375 per share, was immediately exercisable, and
expired unexercised in March2006.
Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP
All individuals employed
by Advent are eligible to participate in the ESPP if Advent employs them for at
least 20 hours per week and at least five months per year. The ESPP permits
eligible employees to purchase Advent common stock through payroll deductions
at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing sale price for the Companys
common stock reported on the NASDAQ National Market at the beginning or the end
of each six-month offering period. In any calendar year, eligible employees can
withhold up to 10% of their salary and certain variable compensation.
1995 ESPP 
In the second quarter of
2003, Advents shareholders approved an amendment to the 1995 ESPP to increase
the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance by 600,000. Through October5, 2005 when the plan
expired, 1,245,289 shares had been issued out of a total of 1,500,000
shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 1995 ESPP. The Company
issued approximately 76,744 and 162,000 shares under the 1995 ESPP at average
prices of $1700 and $1569 in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
2005 ESPP 
On May18, 2005
Advents shareholders approved the 2005 ESPP with 2,000,000 shares of common
stock reserved for issuance. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company issued
110,932 and 72,017 shares under the 2005 ESPP at an average price of $2718 and
$1686, respectively. As of December31, 2006, 1,817,051 shares were
reserved for future issuance under the 2005 ESPP.
401kPlan
Advent sponsors a 401kPlan
to provide retirement benefits for its U.S. employees. This Plan provides for
tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. Employees may contribute
between 1% and 70% of their compensation to this Plan, limited by an annual
maximum amount as determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company also
makes a 50% matching contribution of up to 6% of employee compensation. The
Companys matching contributions to this plan totaled $18 million, $18million,
and $14 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition to
the employer  98  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued matching
contribution, Advent may make profit sharing contributions at the discretion of
the Board of Directors. Advent did not make any profit sharing contributions in
fiscal 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Stock Repurchase Programs
Advents Board has approved common stock repurchase
programs authorizing management to repurchase shares of the Companys common
stock to enhance shareholder value. The timing and actual number of shares
subject to repurchase are at the discretion of Advents management and are
contingent on a number of factors and limitations, including the price of
Advents stock, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment
opportunities and other market conditions. The stock repurchase programs
specify a maximum number of shares subject to repurchase, do not have an
expiration date and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior
notice. Repurchased shares are returned to the status of authorized and
un-issued shares of common stock. 99  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued The

Note 12Segment and
Geographical Information
Description of
Segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker CODM, or decision
making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Advents CODM is the Chief Executive Officer.
Advents organizational structure is based on a number
of factors that the CODM uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations
which include, but are not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products
and technology. Advents operating segments are based on this organizational
structure and information reviewed by Advents CODM to evaluate the operating
segment results. Advent has determined that its operations are organized into
two reportable segments: 1 Advent Investment Management; and 2 MicroEdge.
Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the
business segments disclosed. 100  ADVENT SOFTWARE, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Advent Investment
Management is the Companys core business and derives revenues from the
development, marketing and sale of software products, data interfaces and
related maintenance and services that automate, integrate and support certain
mission-critical functions of investment management organizations. MicroEdge
derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant management,
matching gifts and volunteer tracking for the grant-making community.
Segment Data
The results of the operating segments are derived
directly from Advents internal management reporting system. The accounting
policies used to derive operating segment results are substantially the same as
those used by the consolidated company. Management measures the performance of
each operating segment based on several metrics, including income loss from
operations. These results are used, in part, to evaluate the performance of,
and to assign resources to, each of the operating segments. Certain operating
expenses, including stock-based compensation and amortization and impairment of
developed technology and other intangibles, which Advent manages separately at
the corporate level, are not allocated to the operating segments. Advent does
not separately accumulate and review asset information by segment.
