Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that   
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company     
iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company;and     
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal
33 Table of Contents control over financial reporting as of January30, 2005. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth
in the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOentitled
Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
Management identified the following material weaknesses in its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as of January30, 2005   
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness and accuracy of its accounting for lease related
assets, liabilities and expenses. Specifically, the
Companys controls over the selection, application and
monitoring of its accounting policies related to the effect of
the amortization periods for leasehold improvements, rent
holidays, straight-lining of minimum lease payments, lease
incentives and lessee involvement in asset construction
practices were ineffective to ensure that such transactions were
accounted for in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. This control deficiency resulted in the restatement
of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years
ended February1, 2004 and February2, 2003, the
restatement of each of the quarters in the fiscal year ended
February1, 2004, and the restatement of each of the first
three quarters in and an adjustment to the consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended January30,
2005.     
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness and valuation of our vendor allowance receivable
account and related cost of sales. Specifically, the Company did
not maintain effective controls over the review and approval
process for initial vendor allowance agreements; the monitoring
of modifications to existing vendor allowance agreements; and
the accuracy of our recording of various vendor allowance
transactions. This control deficiency resulted in the
restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal years ended February1, 2004 and February2,
2003, the restatement of each of the quarters in the fiscal year
ended February1, 2004, and the restatement of each of the
first three quarters in and an adjustment to the consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended January30,
2005.     
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
valuation of our inventory allowance accounts for shrinkage and
obsolescence and related cost of sales. Specifically, the
Company did not have effective supervisory and review controls
over our process to determine the inventory shrinkage allowance
and the method of valuing certain slow-moving inventory in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This
control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended
January30, 2005.     
The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain
aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a
sufficient complement of personnel with a level of accounting
expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is
commensurate with the Companys financial reporting
requirements. Specifically, this control deficiency directly
contributed to each of the above described material weaknesses
and also resulted in audit adjustments to our consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended January30,
2005 related to the return to vendor accounts receivable and
self-insurance accrued liability accounts. These material weaknesses could result in a misstatement of the
Companys accounts in a future period that would result in
a material misstatement to the Companys annual or interim
financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.
Because of the material weaknesses described above, management
has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of January30,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
January30, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report which appears herein.
34 Table of Contents PLAN FOR REMEDIATION OF MATERIAL WEAKNESSES The Company has made and will continue to make improvements to
internal control over financial reporting that we believe will
remediate the material weaknesses described above. Specifically,
with regard to our lease accounting practices, management
intends to   
Require a formal accounting review of each new or amended lease
transaction by a management level associate     
Provide additional educational resources to accounting personnel
regarding lease accounting guidance applicable to the various
lease accounting matters that arise in the course of the
Companys business     
Implement additional processes and procedures to
ienhance the communication between the real
estate/property management departments and accounting personnel
concerning various aspects of the Companys lease
transactions, and iihave key accounting personnel more
closely monitor the Companys lease transactions;and     
Hire additional or reassign staff to facilitate the additional
workload needed to handle lease accounting requirements, which
go well beyond the approval and processing of lease payments. With regard to our accounting for vendor allowances, management
intends to address the material weaknesses in the accounting and
estimation for vendor allowances as follows   
Improve the training of personnel in the accounting and
merchandising departments with respect to the Companys
contract review and approval procedures and vendor allowance
policies     
Enhance the staffing of personnel in the merchandising
department     
Clarify the duties and responsibilities of the Company personnel
who interact directly with vendors to reinforce accountability     
Monitor closely vendor agreements with allowances tied to
specific purchase volumes to determine when specified criteria
are met and when allowances have been earned by the
Company;and     
Implement a more formalized quarterly process for updating of
estimates by vendor including reconciliation to the general
ledger accounts. With regard to our estimation and calculation of the required
inventory shrink and obsolescence allowances, management will
reassign the review responsibility to permit a more complete
review and require that certain data inputs be verified by the
reviewer. With regard to the capabilities and experience of our accounting
organization, we intend to   
Implement the organizational structure changes required to
facilitate effective supervisory review     
Evaluate the necessity of additional key finance and accounting
personnel to facilitate a more effective monitoring and review
process; and     
Provide for greater review and oversight for key significant
accounts. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company is still evaluating
the appropriate remediation measures required in order to
address the above-described deficiencies. Progress relative to
our remediation measures with respect to the above material
weaknesses will be disclosed in our subsequent Exchange Act
reports.
35 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of CSK Auto Corporation We have completed an integrated audit of CSK Auto
Corporations consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal year ended January30, 2005 fiscal
2004 and of its internal control over financial reporting
as of January30, 2005 and audits of its consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal years ended February1,
2004 fiscal 2003 and February2, 2003
fiscal 2002 in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under
a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of CSK Auto Corporation and its subsidiaries
the Company at January30, 2005 and
February1, 2004, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended January30, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
listed in the index appearing under a2, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial
statement schedules are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. As described in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has restated its consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002. As described in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for
inventory from the last-in, first-out
LIFOmethod to the first-in, first-out
FIFOmethod. The consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 have been adjusted to
give retroactive effect to the change. As described in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, beginning in fiscal 2003 the Company changed its
method of accounting for vendor allowances to comply with the
provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No02-16
which was not retroactively applied. Internal control over financial reporting Also, we have audited managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item8, that CSK Auto Corporation
did not maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting as of January30, 2005 because of the effect of
material weaknesses relating to the Companys controls
surrounding lease accounting, inventory allowances for shrinkage
and obsolescence, vendor allowances and the Companys
accounting capabilities, experience and resources in the
headquarters accounting function that is commensurate with the
Companys financial reporting requirements, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions
on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
36 Table of Contents We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment.   
1.
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness and accuracy of its accounting for lease related
assets, liabilities and expenses. Specifically, the
Companys controls over the selection, application and
monitoring of its accounting policies related to the effect of
the amortization periods for leasehold improvements, rent
holidays, straight-lining of minimum lease payments, lease
incentives and lessee involvement in asset construction
practices were ineffective to ensure that such transactions were
accounted for in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. This control deficiency resulted in the restatement
of the Companys consolidated financial statements for
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the restatement of each of the
quarters in fiscal 2003, and the restatement of each of the
first three quarters in and an adjustment to the consolidated
financial statements for fiscal 2004.     
2.
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
completeness and valuation of its vendor allowance receivable
account and related cost of sales. Specifically, the Company did
not maintain effective controls over the review and approval
process for initial vendor allowance agreements; the monitoring
of modifications to existing vendor allowance agreements; and
the accuracy of the Companys recording of various vendor
allowance transactions. This control deficiency resulted in the
restatement of the Companys consolidated financial
statements for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, the restatement of
each of the quarters in fiscal 2003, and the restatement of each
of the first three quarters in and an adjustment to the
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004. 37 Table of Contents   
3.
The Company did not maintain effective controls over the
valuation of its inventory allowance accounts for shrinkage and
obsolescence and related cost of sales. Specifically, the
Company did not have effective supervisory and review controls
over its process to determine the inventory shrinkage allowance
and the method of valuing certain slow-moving inventory in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This
control deficiency resulted in audit adjustments to the
consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004.     
4.
The Company did not maintain effective controls over certain
aspects of the financial reporting process because the Company
lacked a sufficient complement of personnel with a level of
accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review
structure that is commensurate with the Companys financial
reporting requirements. Specifically, this control deficiency
directly contributed to each of the above described material
weaknesses and also resulted in audit adjustments to the
Companys consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004
related to the return to vendor accounts receivable and
self-insurance accrued liability accounts. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a
misstatement of the Companys accounts in a future period
that would result in a material misstatement to the
Companys annual or interim financial statements that would
not be prevented or detected. These material weaknesses were
considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of
audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2004 consolidated
financial statements, and our opinion regarding the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those
consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that CSK Auto
Corporation did not maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January30, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the
effects of the material weaknesses described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, CSK Auto
Corporation has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January30, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Phoenix, Arizona May2, 2005 38 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

43 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CSK Auto Corporation is a holding company. At January30,
2005, CSK Auto Corporation had no business activity other than
its investment in CSK Auto, Inc. Auto, a
wholly-owned subsidiary. On a consolidated basis, CSK Auto
Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to herein as the
Company, we, us or
our. Auto is a specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts and
accessories. At January30, 2005, we operated 1,134 stores
in 19states as a fully integrated company and single
business segment under three brand names: Checker Auto Parts,
founded in 1969 and operating in the Southwestern, Rocky
Mountain and Northern Plains states and Hawaii; Schucks Auto
Supply, founded in 1917 and operating in the Pacific Northwest
and Alaska; and Kragen Auto Parts, founded in 1947 and operating
primarily in California.   
Note1
Accounting Change and Restatements of Financial Statements We implemented a voluntary change in our method of accounting
for inventories, which is effected by a retroactive restatement
of our historical financial statements. In addition, we recently
identified errors in our accounting for leases and vendor
allowances, which required a restatement of our historical
financial statements.   
Change in inventory accounting method We historically used the last-in, first-out LIFO
method for accounting for inventories. Effective the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, we changed our method of determining the
cost of inventories to the first-in, first-out
FIFO method. We have applied this accounting
change retroactively by restating prior period financial
statements as required by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No20, Accounting Changes. Our inventory levels over the last five years have increased
modestly due to new store openings and growth. During the same
time, we were able to reduce the overall unit costs of our
inventories. In this environment, our LIFO method of accounting
was resulting in an increasing difference between the carrying
cost of inventories on our balance sheet and our current product
acquisition costs. The carrying cost on our balance sheet under
LIFO reflected the higher prices paid for inventories in prior
periods and also included higher costs paid for inventories
purchased in connection with business acquisitions the last of
which occurred in fiscal 1999. Since we do not expect the
pricing environment for most products we purchase to change
dramatically in the foreseeable future, this difference between
LIFO cost and replacement cost can be expected to continue and
possibly increase as we continue to pursue strategies to reduce
our product acquisition costs. Effective the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we changed to the FIFO method of inventory
accounting which will result in reported inventory cost on our
balance sheet that approximates replacement costs, which we
believe is preferable to continuing to report our inventories at
the higher costs we experienced in prior years. Although the primary effect of the change was a decrease in
inventory on our balance sheet, it also has a significant impact
on our determination of cost of sales because of differences in
unit costs and increases in the amount of vendor allowances and
inventory purchasing and handling costs that will remain in
inventory at period end under FIFO. As shown in the tables
below, the change had the effect of increasing our cost of sales
and reducing our gross profit in the fiscal years ended
February1, 2004 and February2, 2003. The change
increased our cost of sales approximately $34million in
the most recent fiscal year ended January30, 2005.   
Lease accounting restatement We operate in excess of 1,100 leased locations, primarily
consisting of retail stores but also including warehouses,
distribution centers and our corporate office facilities. We
recently identified accounting errors pertaining to the
evaluation of lease terms thus impacting our amortization of
leasehold improvements, free
44 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued rent periods i.e., rent holidays, straight-lining of minimum
escalating lease payments, the classification of landlord
incentives/allowances, and the treatment of costs incurred for
certain stores which are constructed and subsequently
transferred to our landlords. We have corrected these errors by
restating prior period financial statements. We reevaluated our lease terms for our operating leases, which
resulted in a reduction to the useful life assumption for
depreciating leasehold improvements. We previously depreciated
leasehold improvements over the term of the lease which
consisted of the initial term and could include one renewal
option period but no more than 15years in total. We now
include renewal option periods only if they are included in the
lease term as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No13, Accounting for
Leases, as amended. The impact of this increased our
annual depreciation expense for the earlier years of the leases. We previously recorded build-out allowances we received from
landlords as an offset to the amounts capitalized as leasehold
improvements. We are now recording such allowances as a deferred
rent liability with a related increase in recorded property
assets resulting in an increase to depreciation expense while
the amortization of the deferred rent liability reduces
operating rent expense over the lease term. This correction also
increases our reported capital expenditures investing cash
flows and our operating cash flows we report in our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We identified a small number of stores where the extent of our
monetary involvement in the construction of the store based on
the excess of our construction costs over the landlords
reimbursement to us of such costs results in capitalization of
the construction costs as an asset and recording the landlord
reimbursement as construction debt under Emerging Issues Task
Force EIFT No97-10, The Effect of
Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction
EITF97-10. We also identified situations where we did not straight-line
escalating rent or recognize rent for free rent periods. The net
effect of the required adjustments to address these errors
increased rent expenses in our historical financial statements. The Companys overall cash flow was not impacted by these
corrections.   
Vendor allowance restatements We historically recognized estimated vendor allowances in a
systematic manner ratably over a performance period that ran
from October through September. This recognition period was
initially selected to match the benefits to be received with
costs the Company was incurring to perform promotional
activities required to earn the vendor allowances. We recently
reevaluated this accounting convention and concluded that the
recognition period should be corrected to a calendar year
because substantially all allowances are determined and
collected based on purchases from vendors in the calendar year. We also recently identified vendor allowances recorded in fiscal
2003 that will not be collected and have determined that the
amounts were recorded because of errors in estimation in earlier
periods. In addition, we identified certain vendor allowances
recorded in improper periods. The majority of the corrections
were made to fiscal 2003 and 2002; however, corrections were
also made to fiscal 2000, 2001 and the first three quarters of
fiscal 2004. By year, we increased decreased our cost of sales
by $10million for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 60million in fiscal 2003; $89million in fiscal
2002; $17million in fiscal 2001; and $12million
in fiscal 2000. These errors were primarily the result of
imprecise estimates, bookkeeping errors and recording allowances
in the incorrect periods. We have applied the changes required
retroactively by restating prior period financial statements.

STATEMENTSContinued   
Effect of restatements on retained earnings The cumulative effect of the accounting restatements and the
retroactive accounting change increased our accumulated deficit
at February3, 2002 by approximately $934million and
consisted of approximately $663million attributable to
the inventory method change, approximately $97million for
the lease accounting errors and approximately $171million
for the vendor allowance errors.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
CSK Auto Corporation and Auto for all years presented. In
addition, the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the following wholly-owned subsidiaries of Auto for
the periods indicated   
Automotive Information Systems, Inc. AIS, a
provider of diagnostic vehicle repair information. The accounts
were included through the sale of all of our issued and
outstanding capital stock of AIS on January21, 2005 to
Mobile Productivity, Inc. for consideration with a fair value
which approximated our investment.     
CSKAUTO.COM, Inc. Auto.com, which previously
operated our web site that sells automotive aftermarket parts
and accessories that is now operated by PartsAmerica.com. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.   
Basis of Presentation As more fully explained in Note9, bank borrowings by Auto
are guaranteed by the Company, which guarantee is full and
unconditional. Auto.com the Subsidiary Guarantor has also
jointly and severally guaranteed such debt on a full and
unconditional basis. CSK Auto Corporation is a holding company
and has no other direct subsidiaries or independent assets or
operations. The Subsidiary Guarantor is a minor subsidiary and
has no significant independent operations. Summarized financial
statements and other disclosures concerning each of Auto and the
Subsidiary Guarantor are not presented because management
53 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued believes that they are not material to investors. The
consolidated amounts in the accompanying financial statements
are representative of the combined guarantor and issuer. Certain amounts in the prior years financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. This has no impact on previously reported
financial position, results of operations or cash flow.   
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year end is on the Sunday nearest to January 31 of
the following calendar year. The fiscal year ended
January30, 2005 fiscal 2004, fiscal year
ended February1, 2004 fiscal 2003 and the
fiscal year ended February2, 2003 fiscal
2002 each consisted of 52weeks.   
Revenue Recognition We recognize sales upon the delivery of products to our
customers, which generally occurs at our retail store locations.
For certain commercial customers, we also deliver products to
customer locations. All retail and commercial sales are final
upon delivery of products. However, as a convenience to the
customer and as typical of most retailers, we will accept
merchandise returns. We generally limit the period of time
within which products may be returned to 30days and
require returns to be accompanied by original packaging and a
sales receipt. Net sales presented in the accompanying financial
statements are reduced for sales returns. Our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Our
net costs relative to merchandise and service warranties are not
material.   
Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased.   
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of our cash
and cash equivalents, receivables and short-term borrowings
approximate fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note17.   
Derivative Financial Instruments Our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreement is accounted
for in accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended,
and is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value. Changes
in the fair value of the swap and the hedged item are recognized
currently in earnings. Our swap meets the criteria to assume no
hedge ineffectiveness. The fair value of our derivative was
determined from current market prices. See Note10.   
Receivables Receivables are primarily comprised of amounts due from vendors
for rebates or allowances and amounts due from commercial sales
customers. We record an estimated provision for bad debts based
on a percentage of sales and review the allowance quarterly for
adequacy. Specific accounts are written off against the
allowance when management determines the account is
uncollectible.
54 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents and trade receivables. As of January30,
2005, we had cash and cash equivalents on deposit with a major
financial institution that were in excess of FDIC insured
limits. Historically, we have not experienced any loss of our
cash and cash equivalents due to such concentration of credit
risk. We do not hold collateral to secure payment of our trade
accounts receivable. However, management performs ongoing credit
evaluations of our customers financial condition and
provides an allowance for estimated potential losses. Exposure
to credit loss is limited to the carrying amount.   
Vendor allowances and Cost of Sales Cost of sales includes product cost, net of earned vendor
rebates, discounts and allowances. We recognize vendor rebates,
discounts and allowances as a reduction of our cost of inventory
as it is purchased and then in cost of sales as inventory is
sold. Certain of our agreements have several year terms, thus
requiring recognition over an extended period. In March 2003, the EITF reached consensus on certain matters
discussed in EITF02-16, Accounting by a Customer
including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from a
Vendor. EITF02-16states that allowances
provided by our vendors are presumed to be a reduction in the
costs of purchasing inventories to be recognized in inventory
and cost of sales, except for that portion that is a
reimbursement for costs incurred by us to sell the vendors
products. In order to qualify as a reimbursement, the costs must
be specific, identifiable and incremental, to be recognized as a
reduction to operating and administrative expenses. Under
previous accounting guidance, we accounted for all
non-performance based vendor allowances as a reduction of
inventory cost and allocated performance based vendor allowances
as a reduction of advertising expense or cost of goods sold, as
appropriate, in the period the expense was incurred. During the
first quarter of fiscal 2003, we adopted the provisions of
EITF02-16 and implemented a policy of considering all
cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor allowances
to be a reduction of product costs, unless we are specifically
required to substantiate costs incurred to the vendor and do so
in the normal course of business. For fiscal 2002, vendor
allowances totaling $192million were classified as a
reduction to advertising expense in operating and
administrative expense rather than as a reduction to cost of
sales as currently required by EITF02-16. The change in
accounting principle had no impact on cash flow.   
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined utilizing the First-in, First-out
FIFO method. We changed our inventory valuation
method from Last-in, First-out LIFO to FIFO
effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. See Note1
for an explanation of the change. In most instances, we retain
the ability to return damaged, obsolete and excess merchandise
inventory to our vendors. In situations were we do not have a
right to return generally for certain import products, we may
from time to time record an allowance representing an estimated
loss for the difference between the cost of any damaged,
obsolete or excess product and the estimated retail selling
price. Inventory levels and margins earned on all products are
monitored monthly. Quarterly, we make an assessment if we expect
to sell any significant amount of inventory below cost and, if
so, estimate the amount of allowance to record. In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded a charge of approximately
$15million for inventory obsolescence.
55 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued At each balance sheet reporting date, we adjust our inventory
carrying balances by the capitalization of certain operating and
overhead administrative costs associated with purchasing and
handling of inventory, an estimation of vendor allowances that
remain in ending inventory at period end, and allowances for
inventory shrinkage and obsolescence as follows

Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including purchased software, are
recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed for
financial reporting purposes utilizing the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which
range from 3 to 25years, or for leasehold improvements and
property under capital leases, the shorter of the lease term or
the economic life. Maintenance and repairs are charged to
earnings when incurred. When property and equipment is retired
or sold, the net book value of the asset, reduced by any
proceeds, is charged to gain or loss. For stores in which we are
a seller-lessee and do not recover substantially all
construction costs, we record the costs in property and
equipment and amounts funded by the lessor are recorded as a
debt obligation in the accompanying balance sheet.   
Lease Obligations We lease all but one of our store locations in addition to our
distribution centers, office space and certain equipment and
vehicles. At the inception of the lease, we evaluate each
agreement to determine whether the lease will be accounted for
as an operating or capital lease. The term of the lease used for
this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in
instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be
reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would
result in an economic penalty. Certain leases contain rent
escalation clauses and rent holidays, which are recorded on a
straight-line basis over the lease term with the difference
between the rent paid and the straight-line rent recorded as a
deferred rent liability. Lease incentive payments received from
landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as a
reduction in rent. Certain leases contain provisions that
require additional rental payments based upon a specified sales
volume, which are accrued as the liabilities are incurred.   
Internal Software Development Costs Certain internal software development costs are capitalized and
amortized over the life of the related software. Amounts
capitalized during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$29million, $33million and $28million,
respectively. Accumulated amortization as of January30,
2005 and February1, 2004 was $39million and
$64million, respectively.   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets In accordance with SFASNo142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is no longer amortized,
but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually. Other
intangible assets consist of leasehold interests representing
the discounted net present value of the excess of the fair
rental value over the respective
56 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued contractual rent of facilities under operating leases acquired
in business combinations. Amortization expense is computed on a
straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. See
Note8 for the impact of this amortization on the statement
of operations.   
Impairment of Other Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets to be held
and used or disposed of are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In the event assets
are impaired, losses are recognized based on the excess carrying
amount over the estimated fair value of the asset. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
the fair market value less selling costs.   
Store Closing Costs We provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in
connection with store closures and losses on the disposal of
store-related assets, which is net of anticipated, sublease
income. Prior to January1, 2003, such costs were
recognized when a store was specifically identified, costs could
be estimated and closure was planned to be completed within the
next twelve months. On January1, 2003, we adopted the
provisions of SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit of Disposal Activities. See
Note14.   
Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In connection with
our adoption of EITF02-16 in the first quarter of fiscal
2003, we implemented a policy whereby all cooperative
advertising arrangements would be considered a reduction of
product costs, unless we are specifically required to
substantiate costs incurred to the vendor and do so in the
normal course of business. Advertising expense for fiscal 2004
and 2003 totaled $499million and $480million,
respectively. Advertising expense for fiscal 2002 totaled
$256million, net of vendor funded cooperative advertising.   
Preopening Costs Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and
occupancy costs, are expensed as incurred.   
Self-Insurance Reserves We purchase third-party insurance for workers
compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims
that exceed a certain dollar threshold. However, we are
responsible for the payment of claims under these insured
limits. In estimating the obligation associated with incurred
losses, we utilize loss development factors prepared by an
independent third-party actuary. These development factors
utilize historical data to project the future development of
incurred losses. Loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual
claims settlements and reported claims. Our self-insurance
reserves approximated $194million and $176million
at January30, 2005 and February1, 2004,
respectively, and are included with current liabilities in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.   
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in
future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts temporary
differences at each year-end based on enacted tax laws and
statutory rates applicable to the period in which the temporary
differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation
allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax
expense includes both taxes payable for the period and the
change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Income tax expense reflects
57 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued our best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other
things, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of
the tax laws, and tax planning. Future changes in tax laws,
changes in projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning
could affect the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded.   
Stock-Based Compensation We have stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described more fully in Note12. We continue to apply the
recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles
Board APBOpinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and related interpretations in
accounting for those plans. No material stock-based employee
compensation expense is reflected in net income loss for
fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 as the intrinsic value of all options
granted under those plans was zero. During fiscal 2004, we
issued restricted stock with a fair value of $12million
to our executive officers and other associates pursuant to our
CSK Auto Corporation 2004 Stock and Incentive Plan. Compensation
expense for this restricted stock will be charged to expense
ratably over the three-year vesting period. During fiscal 2004 01million was recorded as compensation expense related
to these grants. The following table illustrates the effect on
net income loss and earnings loss per share if we had

Earnings Loss per Share SFASNo128 Earnings Per Share,
EPSrequires earnings per share to be computed and
reported as both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents
convertible notes and interest on the notes, stock awards and
stock options outstanding during the period. Dilutive EPS
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to
issue common stock were exercised into common stock. The

because they would have been anti-dilutive.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.   
Note3
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB issued revised
SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment.
SFASNo123R sets accounting requirements for
share-based compensation to employees and requires
companies to recognize in the income statement the grant-date
fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation.
SFASNo123R is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June15, 2005. We will be required to adopt
SFASNo123R in our first quarter of fiscal 2006. We
currently disclose the proforma impact on net income loss and
earnings loss per share under SFASNo123, in
Note2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are
currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of
SFASNo123R on our financial position and results of
operations, including the valuation methods and support for the
assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB
No43, Chapter4, which clarifies the
accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. The
standard requires that such costs be excluded from the cost of
inventory and expensed when incurred. SFASNo151 is
effective for fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005.
We do not expect that the adoption of SFASNo151
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment
of APB No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions, which addresses the measurement
59 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and eliminates the exception
from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets. SFASNo153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after June15, 2005. We do not expect that the
adoption of SFASNo153 will have a material effect
on our consolidated financial statements.   
Note4
Business Disposition During fiscal 2002, we sold 13 stores in Texas. The stores were
sold because they were geographically remote from our other
operations. This transaction resulted in net cash proceeds of
$42million and a loss upon sale of $08million.   
Note5
Transactions and Relationships with Related Parties   
Sale of Stock by Affiliates On June22, 2004, pursuant to our share repurchase program
approved by our Board of Directors on June8, 2004, we
purchased approximately 476,000shares of our common stock
in a privately negotiated transaction from entities associated
with or organized by Investcorp, S.A., formerly one of our
principal stockholders. The purchase price of the shares we
bought was at an approximate 1% discount from the average market
price of our common stock on the date of purchase. Charles
Marquis, a member of our Board of Directors, is employed by
Investcorp. During January 2004 and September 2003, entities associated with
or organized by Investcorp, S.A., sold approximately
26million and 30million shares, respectively, of
CSK Auto Corporation common stock. We did not receive any
proceeds from the sales of such stock nor did this transaction
result in share dilution. We incurred expenses related to these
transactions of approximately $02million. On July2, 2002, an entity affiliated with the Carmel Group
Carmel, a former stockholder group of ours, sold
26million shares of CSK Auto Corporation stock in a
secondary offering. On November20, 2002, the Carmel
stockholders sold their remaining approximately 30million
shares of CSK Auto Corporation common stock in an underwritten
offering. We did not receive any proceeds from the sales of
common stock by Carmel and incurred approximately
$05million of accounting, legal and miscellaneous
expenses. Upon the sale by Carmel of all of their shares, a
stockholders agreement originally executed in 1996 and
subsequently amended, was terminated, except with respect to
certain registration rights.   
Lease Transactions We have in the past entered into several lease agreements with
parties who at lease inception were, but no longer are, related
parties. The leases are for approximately 125,000square
feet of office space and real property and run through October
2012. These lease agreements are subject to certain
inflation-based adjustments that could affect the rent expense
in future periods. The agreements formerly were with entities
affiliated with Carmel, previously one of our principal
stockholders see above. During each of the fiscal years
presented, we paid annual rent in the amount of approximately
$25million to the former related party for these leases.
The amounts for fiscal years 2004 and 2003 are annual amounts
even though the related party relationship ended on
November20, 2002. We believe that the terms of the leasing
transactions with these former related parties described above
were no less favorable to us than terms that may have been
available from independent third parties at the time of the
applicable transaction.   
Other Transactions In December 2001, in connection with the refinancing of our then
existing credit facility, we sold $500million aggregate
principal amount of 7%convertible subordinated debentures
due December 2006 the convertible debentures and related
contingently exercisable warrants the make-whole warrants,
consisting
60 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued of $300million in principal amount and one make-whole
warrant to Investcorp CSK Holdings L.P., an affiliate of
Investcorp S.A., and $20million in principal amount and
one make-whole warrant to an unrelated third party investor in a
private placement. Interest on the debentures was payable
quarterly, either in cash or, at our election, additional shares
of our common stock. The convertible debentures and make-whole
warrants issued to Investcorp CSK Holdings L.P. were on the same
terms as those issued to the unrelated third party. On
May20, 2002, we converted these debentures for both
Investcorp CSK Holdings L.P. and the third party into
approximately 575million shares of our common stock
approximately 345million shares to Investcorp CSK
Holdings L.P. and 23million shares to the third party,
based on a conversion price of $869per share. In
addition, we elected to pay interest on the debentures in
additional shares of CSK Auto Corporation common stock in lieu
of cash. Of the additional interest shares issued, 105,708 were
issued during the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and 30,872 were
issued during the second quarter of fiscal 2002.

quarterly basis to determine whether events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable and an impairment loss should be recognized.
Such evaluation is based on the expected utilization of the
related asset and the corresponding useful life.

January30, 2005, the last day of our fiscal year and we
determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. Our intangible assets, excluding goodwill, consist of favorable
leasehold interests resulting from business acquisitions.
Leasehold interests associated with store closures are written
off at the time of closure. Amortization expense related to the
leasehold interests is computed on a straight-line basis over
the respective lease terms. Estimated amortization expense
relating to leasehold interests for future periods is listed

Our various debt and credit agreements contain covenants
restricting our ability to, among other things, incur additional
debt, create or allow liens, pay dividends, merge or consolidate
with or invest in other companies, sell, lease or transfer all
or substantially all of our properties or assets, or make
certain payments with respect to our outstanding capital stock,
issue preferred stock and engage in certain transactions with
affiliates. In addition, we must comply with certain financial
covenants, ratios and tests, including a maximum leverage ratio
and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance
with all such covenants at January30, 2005. The
Companys senior credit facility does not currently permit
Auto to distribute funds to CSK Auto Corporation for the
purposes of paying dividends on the Companys common stock.   
Recent Transactions and Loss on Debt Retirement We completed the following transactions during recent years   
In December 2004, we elected to redeem the approximately
$149million remaining balance of our 12%senior
notes due 2006 at a redemption price equal to 106% of the
principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. 63 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
In January 2004, we completed a refinancing of our debt that
included the redemption of approximately 94% of our then
outstanding 12%senior notes and the issuance of
$2250million 7%senior subordinated notes.     
In January 2004, we also amended our senior credit facility,
increasing the amount of our facility by $750million to
$4000million, consisting of a $2550million term
loan and a $1450million revolving credit facility.     
In June 2003, we replaced our then existing $3000million
senior credit facility with a $3250million senior
collateralized, asset based credit facility consisting of a
$2000million term loan and a $1250million
revolving credit commitment. We used proceeds from the credit
facility increase to redeem the remaining $95million in
aggregate principal amount of our 11%senior subordinated
notes, including accrued and unpaid interest.     
In July 2002, we sold shares of our common stock in an
underwritten public offering and used proceeds from the sale of
those shares to retire approximately $717million of our
11%senior subordinated notes. In conjunction with the amendments and retirements noted above,
we recorded losses on debt retirement during fiscal 2004, 2003,
and 2002 of $10million, $495million and
$60million, respectively. The losses on debt retirement
include if applicable early redemption premiums, the write-off
of certain financing fees, a prorata adjustment representing the
unamortized fair market value swap adjustment and other direct
costs.   
Conversion of Notes On May20, 2002, at our option, the $50million
7%Convertible Subordinated Debentures issued in December
2001, were converted into approximately 575million shares
of CSK Auto Corporation common stock. Pursuant to the agreements
relating to the debentures, interest on the debentures was paid
in 136,580shares of CSK Auto Corporation common stock in
lieu of cash. At the time of the conversion, the
$500million principal amount, $08million of
unamortized debt discount and $30million of unamortized
debt issuance costs were converted to common stock and
additional paid-in capital.   
Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit facility is comprised of a $2550million
term loan and a $1450million revolving credit facility.
The term loan is to be repaid in twelve installments consisting
of ten $1275million dollar payments made semiannually
beginning in December 2004 and two final payments of
$1205million each in December 2009 and at maturity,
August 2010. The revolving credit facility matures in June 2008.
At January30, 2005, there were no borrowings under the
revolving credit facility. The availability under the revolving
credit facility at January30, 2005 was
$1140million. Although there were no outstanding
borrowings on the revolving facility, $310million was
committed under letters of credit. Loans under the senior credit
facility are collateralized by a first priority security
interest in substantially all of our assets and in all of the
capital stock of CSKAuto, Inc. The senior credit facility
provides that we may from time to time make optional prepayments
of loans in whole or in part without penalty, subject to minimum
prepayments and reimbursement of the lenders breakage
costs in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate loans. On August10, 2004, we amended our senior credit facility
to provide for an immediate reduction of the interest rate on
the term loan of 25basis points and an opportunity for an
additional 25basis points reduction of the interest rate
on such term loan upon the achievement of certain conditions, as
more particularly set forth in the amendment. The current
interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan
are LIBOR+ 275basis points and LIBOR +
200basis points, respectively. The amendment also provides
for a one-year extension of the term loan maturity to August
2010.
64 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Interest accrues under the senior credit facility based on a
variable rate, which is a function of the spread over the Base
rate as defined in the agreement or the Eurodollar rate as
defined in the agreement at our option. The average interest
rate on the term loan portion of the facility was 37%, 42% and
54% for fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The average
interest rate on the revolver portion of the facility was 48 51% and 58% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Interest is payable upon borrowing maturity or
quarterly, depending on the type of loan.   
7%Senior Subordinated Notes In January 2004, we issued $2250million of 7%senior
subordinated notes due January15, 2014. Interest is
payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. On or after
January15, 2009, we may redeem some or all of the notes at
the redemption prices listed below plus accrued and unpaid
interest to the date of redemption. We may redeem all of the
notes prior to that date pursuant to the make-whole provisions
as defined in the indenture governing the notes. In addition, we
may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the
notes before January15, 2007 with the net proceeds of
certain equity offerings. At any time on or after
January15, 2009, we may redeem the notes for cash at our
option, in whole or in part, at the following redemption prices
expressed as percentages of the principal amount:
January15, 2009 through January15, 2010, 1035 January15, 2010 through January15, 2011, 1023 January15, 2011 through January15, 2012, 1012%; and
January15, 2012 through maturity, 100%. If we experience a
Change of Control as defined in the indenture governing these
notes, holders of the notes will have the right to require us
to repurchase their notes at a purchase price of 101% of the
principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and liquidated damages, if any, to the date of the purchase. The notes are unsecured general obligations of CSK Auto, Inc.
They rank junior in right of payment to all of our existing and
future senior debt, equal in right of payment to all of our
future senior subordinated indebtedness, senior in right of
payment to all of our future subordinated indebtedness and are
unconditionally guaranteed by CSK Auto Corporation and the
Subsidiary Guarantors on a senior subordinated basis.   
Seller Financing Arrangements Seller financing arrangements relate to debt established for
stores in which we were the seller-lessee and did not recover
substantially all construction costs from the lessor. In those
situations, we recorded our total cost in property and equipment
and amounts funded by the lessor as a debt obligation in the
accompanying balance sheet in accordance with EITF
No97-10, The Effect of Lessee Involvement in Asset
Construction. Rental payments made to the lessor are
charged to interest expense and reduce the corresponding debt
based on amortization schedules.   
Note10
Derivative Financial Instruments During April 2004, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to convert $1000million of our 7%senior
subordinated notes due 2014 to a floating rate, set quarterly in
arrears, equal to the 6month LIBOR+ 283basis
points. The agreement is for the term of the notes. The interest
rate swap was intended to hedge the fair value of these notes
against potential movements in market interest rates. The hedge
is considered to qualify as a fair value hedge;
accordingly, the fair value of the derivative and changes in the
fair value of the underlying debt will be reported on our
balance sheet. Based upon our assessment of effectiveness of the
hedge, changes in the fair value of this derivative and the
underlying debt are not expected to result in a material impact
on net income. During February 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to convert the interest rate payment obligation on
$1000million of our 12%senior notes to a floating
rate, set quarterly, equal to the 3month LIBOR rate plus
760basis points. The interest rate swap was intended to
provide a better balance of fixed and variable rate debt
instruments and to hedge the fair value of these notes against
potential movements
65 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued in market interest rates. On June5, 2003, we terminated
the swap agreement and received in consideration thereof the sum
of $60million, which represented the fair market value of
the swap agreement on that date. In December 2004, we redeemed
the remaining 12%senior notes to which the rate swap
agreement was associated and at that time recognized the
remaining portion of the unamortized fair market value
adjustment as a component of the loss on debt retirement. See
Note9. The differential to be paid or received under these agreements
was accrued consistent with the terms of the agreement and was
recognized in interest expense over the term of the related
debt. The related amounts payable to or receivable from the
counter party are included in other liabilities or assets. Cash
flows related to the interest rate swap agreements are
classified as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows. We reduced interest expense by $13million 22million and $24million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, as a result of the interest rate swaps. Due
to the effect of the rate swap on the related notes, the average
interest rate in 2004 on our $2250million 7%senior
subordinated notes due January15, 2014, approximated 64%.   
Note11
Leases We lease our office and warehouse facilities, all but one of our
retail stores, and certain of our equipment. Generally, store
leases provide for minimum rentals and the payment of utilities,
maintenance, insurance and taxes. Certain store leases also
provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales
in excess of a stipulated minimum. The majority of lease
agreements are for base lease periods ranging from 10 to
20years, with three to five renewal options of five years
each. Operating lease rental expense is as follows $ in thousands

Employee Benefit Plans We provide various health, welfare and disability benefits to
our full-time employees that are funded primarily by Company
contributions. Other than for certain of our senior executives,
we do not provide post-employment or post-retirement health care
or life insurance benefits to our employees.   
Supplemental Retirement Plan Agreement We have a supplemental retirement plan agreement with our
Chairman which provides supplemental retirement benefits for a
period of ten years beginning the earlier of
iFebruary1, 2006, and iithe first
anniversary of the effective date of termination of his
employment for any reason other than for Cause as defined in
such retirement plan agreement. The benefit amount payable to
our Chairman under this agreement is based on the percentage of
the benefit vested as of the date of termination of his
employment, not to exceed $600,000per annum. In December
2004, this agreement was amended to make such changes as were
necessary to bring the agreement into compliance with the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.   
Retirement Program We sponsor a 401k plan that is available to all our employees
who have completed one year of continuous service. Effective
October1, 1997, we match from 40% to 60% of employee
contributions in 10% increments, based on years of service, up
to 4% of the participants base salary. Participant
contributions are subject to certain restrictions as set forth
in the Internal Revenue Code. Our matching contributions totaled
$15million, $12million, and $13million for
fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.   
2004 Stock and Incentive Plan In June 2004, our shareholders approved the CSK Auto Corporation
2004 Stock and Incentive Plan the Plan which
replaces all of the following previously existing plans:
1the 1996 Associate Stock Option Plan; 2the 1996
Executive Stock Option Plan; 3the 1999 Executive Stock
Option Plan; and 4the CSK Auto Corporation Directors
Stock Plan. Approximately 19million options to purchase
shares of our common stock granted under these prior plans were
still outstanding at the inception of the new Plan. These
options can still be exercised by the grantees according to the
provisions of the prior plans. Pursuant to the
67 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued provisions of the Plan, any of these options which are cancelled
under the prior plans will be added to shares available for
issuance under the Plan. The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our
Board of Directors, which has broad authority in administering
and interpreting the Plan. We believe the Plan will promote and
closely align the interests of our employees and directors with
our stockholders by permitting the award of stock-based
compensation and other performance-based compensation. We
believe the Plan will strengthen our ability to reward
performance that enhances long-term stockholder value and
strengthen our ability to attract and retain outstanding
employees and executives. Plan participation is limited to
employees of the Company, any subsidiary or parent of the
Company and to directors of the Company. The Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options,
non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, stock units, incentive bonuses and other stock
unit awards. Under the Plan, the number and kind of shares as to
which options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
stock units, incentive bonuses or other stock unit awards may be
granted is 40million shares of our common stock plus any
shares subject to awards made under the prior plans that were
outstanding on the effective date of the Plan. The number of
shares that can be granted for certain of the items listed above
may be restricted per the Plan document. In no event will any
option be exercisable more than 10years after the date the
option is granted. In general, the stock incentives vest in
three years. As of January30, 2005, there were
approximately 30million shares available for grant. During fiscal 2004, the Company issued 82,885shares of
restricted stock, at an average market price of $1323, to our
executive officers and other associates pursuant to the Plan.
The restricted stock was valued at the market price of the stock
on the New York Stock Exchange on the grant date and
approximately $11million was recorded as deferred
compensation with an offset to additional paid-in capital in
stockholders equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The
deferred compensation in stockholders equity will be
amortized to expense over the three year vesting period of each
grant. Compensation expense of $01million was recorded
during fiscal 2004. Also 3,818shares of restricted stock
were issued to our directors under the Plan. In fiscal years
2003 and 2002, 3,054 and 3,212shares of restricted stock
respectively were issued to our Directors under the prior CSK
Auto Corporation Directors Stock Plan. Grants to directors
generally vest over a one year period.   
Option Cancellations During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, we cancelled
outstanding stock options to purchase an aggregate of
496,296shares of our common stock that had been granted to
certain Company executives under all of our option plans. The
options covered by such cancellations had exercise prices
ranging from $1750 to $3225per share, with a weighted
average exercise price of $2634per share. During fiscal
2002, new stock options to purchase an aggregate of
496,296shares of our common stock were granted to these
executives. The exercise price of the vast majority of the new
stock options was $1100per share, which was the greater
of: a$1100per share; or bthe fair market
value of CSK Auto Corporation common stock on the date of grant.
These options were granted six months and one day after the
cancellation and, consistent with the guidance in
FINNo44, Accounting for Certain Transactions
Involving Stock Compensation: An Interpretation of APB Opinion

We have recorded deferred tax assets of $141million as of
January30, 2005 reflecting the benefit of federal and
state tax loss carryforwards approximating $386million
and $121million, which begin to expire in 2015 and 2008,
respectively. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient
taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards.
Utilization of certain of the net operating loss carryforwards
may be limited under Section382 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Although realization is not assured, management believes
it is more likely than not that all the deferred tax assets will
be realized with the exception of a portion of California
Enterprise Zone credits for which management has determined that
a valuation allowance in the amount of $14 million is necessary. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based
on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional
taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of
these amounts is not required, we reverse the liability and
recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine
that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an
additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in
which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than
we expect the ultimate assessment to be.   
Note14
Store Closing Costs We provide an allowance for estimated costs to be incurred in
connection with store closures. On an on-going basis, store
locations are reviewed and analyzed based on several factors
including market saturation, store profitability, and store size
and format. In addition, we analyze sales trends and
geographical and competitive factors to determine the viability
and future profitability of our store locations. If a store
location does not meet our required projections, it is
considered for closure. The allowance for store closing costs is included in accrued
expenses and other long term liabilities in the accompanying
financial statements and primarily consists of three components:
1future rents to be paid over the remaining terms of the
lease agreements for the stores net of estimated probable
sublease recoveries; 2lease commissions associated with
the anticipated store subleases; and 3occupancy expenses
associated with the closed store vacancy periods. Prior to
January1, 2003, such costs were recognized when a store
was specifically identified, costs could be estimated and
closure was planned to be completed within the next twelve
months in accordance with EITF94-3, Liability
Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. No provision was made for employee termination
costs. For stores to be relocated, such costs were recognized
when an agreement for the new location had been reached with a
landlord and site plans met preliminary municipal approvals.
During the period that they remained open for business, the rent
and other operating expenses for the stores to be closed
continued to be reflected in normal operating expenses.
71 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued As a result of the refinancing transactions we completed in
January 2004, we increased our cash flow and financial
flexibility, enabling us to pursue an alternate strategy to
reduce our portfolio of closed stores, which includes lease
buyouts and foregoing lease extensions on locations that we
subleased at a marginal profit. This change in strategy requires
us to establish a new closed store reserve based upon the
guidance in SFASNo146 Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFASNo146 and reverse the existing
closed store reserve that was previously established under
EITF94-3. SFASNo146 requires that costs under
a lease contract for a closed store be recognized at fair value
and that the amount of remaining lease payments owed be reduced
by estimated sublease income but not to an amount less than
zero. This change in methodology resulted in a non-cash charge
of $122million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
The charge reflects the elimination from the reserve of net
sublease income previously recorded for leases with incremental
estimated sublease income in excess of the cost of the original
lease, partially offset by the discounting of net cash outflow.
Sublease income in excess of costs associated with the lease is
recognized as it is earned. We have also applied
SFASNo146 to exit or disposal activities initiated
or exit plans substantially modified after December31,
2002 as required. As of January30, 2005, we had a total of 141 store
locations included in the allowance for store closing costs. Of
this total, 12 locations were vacant and 129 locations were
subleased. In addition to these stores, we had 54 service
centers also included in the allowance for store closing costs,
of which 3 were vacant and 51 were subleased. Future rent
expense will be incurred through the expiration of the
non-cancelable leases, the longest of which runs through March
2018. Activity in the allowance for store closings and the related
payments for the three fiscal years ended January30, 2005
is as follows $ in thousands

72 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued During fiscal 2003, we recorded the following:
1$122million in charges associated with the
reversal of the reserve established under EITF94-3 and the
establishment of a new closed store reserve on the basis of our
change in exit strategy in accordance with the guidance in
SFASNo146; 2$02million in charges
under SFASNo146 associated with the closure of 13
stores, with the majority closed at the expiration of the master
lease; and 3revisions in estimates of $03million
primarily relating to plan year 2001 resulting from changes in
estimated vacancy periods and lower realized sublease rates. During fiscal 2002, we recorded the following: 1gross
store closing costs of $13million relating to the
identification of 25 stores for closure; 2an adjustment
to prior plans of $12million primarily due to
managements decision to utilize a warehouse and storage
facility that was previously included within the 1999 plan year
accrual in conjunction with purchase accounting adjustments as a
result of certain acquisitions; and 3revisions in
estimates of $49million $30million for plan year
2001, $01million for plan year 2000 and $18million
for plan years prior to 2000 relating to existing closed stores
that have had longer than anticipated vacancy periods as a
result of the continued economic slowdown. We expect net cash outflows for closed store locations of
approximately $40million during fiscal 2005 and the
remainder of cash outflows to primarily occur during fiscal
years 2006 through 2008. We plan to fund these outflows from
normal operating cash flows. We anticipate that we will close or
relocate approximately 18 stores during fiscal 2005. We
anticipate that the majority of these closures will occur at the
end of the lease terms, resulting in minimal closed store costs.
We anticipate total cash outflows relating to these stores of
$03million, which includes estimated incremental costs to
be measured at fair value when incurred.   
Note15
Stockholders Equity   
Stock Repurchase Program On June8, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a share
repurchase program that authorized the purchase of shares of our
common stock with an aggregate purchase price not to exceed
$250million. The program provides that we may buy shares
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and
that we will base our decisions on whether to repurchase shares
and the timing of any such repurchases on factors including the
stock price, our cash and debt levels, and general economic and
market conditions. Shares of stock repurchased under the program
will be retired and returned to the status of authorized and
unissued shares. This program will expire in December 2005.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we did not repurchase
any shares of our common stock. Since the inception of this
program, we have repurchased approximately 16million
shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately
$237million. The repurchase has been recorded as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital.   
Issuance of Common Stock On July2, 2002, we sold 6,878,300 primary shares of common
stock in an underwritten public offering at $12per share.
In addition, a selling stockholder sold an additional
26million shares in the offering. On November20,
2002, the same stockholder together with affiliated stockholders
sold their remaining approximately 30million shares. We
received no proceeds from the shares sold by the selling
stockholders. Issuance costs related to the stock offerings
approximated $09million. These costs included
approximately $04million of legal, accounting and
printing fees charged to additional paid in capital for the
primary offering and approximately $05million of costs
charged to operating expense for the secondary offerings.
Proceeds from the primary offering were used to retire
approximately $717million of our outstanding
11%Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006. The early
extinguishment of this debt resulted in a loss on debt
retirement of $60million, primarily as a result of the
payment of an early redemption premium and the write off of
deferred debt issuance costs.
73 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Management Stock Purchase Agreements and Loan Plans In May 2002, we extended a personal loan to Mr.Martin
Fraser, our President and Chief Operating Officer, in the
principal amount of $125,000, pursuant to Mr.Frasers
execution of a Promissory Note and Stock Pledge Agreement. The
Promissory Note provided for quarterly payment of interest on
the outstanding principal amount of the loan equal to the
average interest rate paid by CSK Auto, Inc. under the revolving
portion of its senior credit facility during such period. During fiscal years 1997 and 2000, pursuant to executive stock
loan plans, we loaned $10million and $02million,
respectively, to certain executives to purchase shares of our
common stock. These loans are collateralized by stock under
pledge agreements, provide full recourse to the executive, bear
interest at the average rate paid under the revolving portion of
our senior credit facility and had maturity dates of 2003 and
2005, respectively. All loans that matured in 2003 have been
repaid. Only one loan maturing in 2005 and totaling
approximately $10,000 is still outstanding. The loan is
reflected as a stockholder receivable in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity.   
Retirement of Common Stock On September30, 2002, Mr.Fraser surrendered
11,000shares of CSK Auto Corporation common stock to us in
full payment and satisfaction of the above-referenced loan
including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the then
outstanding balance of a separate loan in the principal amount
of $9,731 plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon which
had been extended to Mr.Fraser in February 2000 pursuant
to our Senior Executive Stock Loan Plan. Upon receipt of the
shares, we cancelled and retired the shares. Mr.Fraser
currently has no outstanding loans with us. In November 2002, a member of our Board of Directors resigned
and surrendered 952shares of CSKAuto Corporation
common stock to us, which had been recently issued to him
pursuant to our outside director compensation policy. Upon
receipt of the shares, we cancelled and retired the shares.   
Note16
Legal Matters During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we received
notification from the State of California Board of Equalization
the Board of an assessment for approximately
$12million for sales tax and approximately
$06million for related interest based on the Boards
audit findings for the tax periods of October 1997 through
September 2000. During this time period, we refunded the sales
tax associated with battery cores to customers who returned a
battery core to our stores. The Board believes that the sales
tax associated with the battery cores should have been remitted
to the taxing authority rather than refunded to the customers.
Based on the Boards position, we could be responsible for
the sales tax and related interest associated with this matter
for the audited periods of October 1997 through September 2000,
plus the additional unaudited time period through December 2002,
when we changed our business practices in this area to mitigate
potential future tax related liability. We believe that we have a strong basis under California law for
disputing the payment of this assessment, and in October 2003 we
timely filed a Petition for Redetermination with the Board. In
May 2004, we received a response from the Board indicating that
the district office that conducted the audit upheld its
position. We attended an appeals conference on April4,
2005 and are awaiting the decision from the appeals conference.
Our practices through December 2002 relative to the handling of
taxes on battery cores had been consistent for over a decade,
and it is our position that our consistent treatment of battery
core charges, together with prior tax audits and tax
auditors written commentary concerning our handling of
such charges, permits us to rely upon precedent set in prior
audits. Reliance on prior audits is a position that is
supportable under California law. We also have other defenses
and intend to vigorously defend our position with regard to this
74 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued matter. A liability for the potential sales tax and related
interest payments has not been recorded in our consolidated
financial statements. We were served on October26, 2004 with a lawsuit that was
filed in the Superior Court in SanDiego, California. The
case was brought by a former sales associate in California who
resigned in January 2003, and purports to be a class action on
behalf of all current and former California hourly store
employees claiming that plaintiff and those similarly situated
were not paid for: iall time worked i.e. off the
clock work, iithe minimum reporting time pay when
they reported to work a second time in a day, iiiall
overtime due, iv all wages due at termination, and
vamounts due for late or missed meal periods or rest
breaks. Plaintiff also alleges that we violated certain record
keeping requirements arising out of the foregoing alleged
violations. The lawsuit claims these alleged practices are
unfair business practices, and requests back pay, restitution,
penalties for violations of various Labor Code sections and for
failure to pay all wages due on termination, and interest for
the last four years, plus attorney fees and that the Company be
enjoined from committing further unfair business practices. We
believe we have meritorious defenses to all of these claims and
intend to defend the claims vigorously. If one or more of the
claims is permitted by the court to proceed as a class action
and is decided against us, the aggregate potential financial
exposure could be material to our annual results of operations.
We do not believe an adverse outcome would materially affect our
liquidity or consolidated financial position. However, the
litigation is in its early stages and we cannot predict the
outcome with any certainty. A liability for this matter has not
been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We currently and from time to time are involved in other
litigation incidental to the conduct of our business, including
asbestos and similar product liability claims, slip and fall and
other general liability claims, discrimination and employment
claims, vendor disputes, and miscellaneous environmental and
real estate claims. The damages claimed in some of this
litigation are substantial. Based on internal review, we accrue
reserves using our best estimate of the probable and reasonably
estimable contingent liabilities. We do not currently believe
that any of these other legal claims incidental to the conduct
of our business, individually or in the aggregate, will result
in liabilities material to our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

Guarantees In connection with the disposition and/or sublease of certain
store locations and service centers, we have indemnified the
purchasers/subtenants against claims arising from environmental
contamination, if any, existing on the date of disposition. In
some of these cases, we are indemnified by or have recourse to
an unrelated third party for claims arising from any such
contamination, and also, or in the alternative, have insurance
coverage that may be available to offset the potential cost of
the indemnity obligation. We also indemnify third party
landlords under most of our store leases against claims
resulting from the occurrence of
75 Table of Contents CSK AUTO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued certain triggering events or conditions arising out of our
operations from the leased premises. We enter into various other
agreements with unrelated parties in the ordinary course of our
business, which may include indemnity obligations relating to a
triggering event, or condition, which is, in most cases, based
on our future performance. In some cases, the indemnity
obligations are triggered by our prior acts or third
parties future performance, but are otherwise not limited
in duration or monetary exposure. However, in such instances, we
have determined that the likelihood of occurrence of the
triggering event is remote and/or that the potential cost to us
of performance of the indemnity would not be material. Our risk management philosophy is to limit risk in any
transaction or relationship to the maximum extent reasonable in
relation to commercial and other considerations. Before
accepting any indemnity obligation, we make an informed risk
management decision considering, among other things, the
remoteness of the possibility that the triggering event will
occur, the potential costs to perform any resulting indemnity
obligation, possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a
triggering event or to reduce the costs of performing an
indemnity obligation, whether we are in fact indemnified by an
unrelated third party, insurance coverage that may be available
to offset the cost of the indemnity obligation, and the benefits
to us from the transaction or relationship. Because most of our indemnity obligations are not limited in
duration or potential monetary exposure, we cannot calculate the
maximum potential amount of future payments that could be paid
under our indemnity obligations stemming from all our existing
agreements. We also accrue for contingent liabilities, including
those arising out of indemnity obligations, when a loss is
probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. We are not
aware of the occurrence of any triggering event or condition
that would have a material adverse impact on our financial
statements as a result of an indemnity obligation relating to
such triggering event or condition. We have issued standby letters of credit related to insurance
coverage, lease obligations and other matters that expire during
fiscal 2005. As of January30, 2005, total amounts
committed under these letters of credit were $359million. Note19 Quarterly Results unaudited Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest
sales occurring in the months of June through October
overlapping our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition,
our business is affected by weather conditions. While unusually
severe or inclement weather tends to reduce sales as customers
are more likely to defer elective maintenance during such
periods, extremely hot and cold temperatures tend to enhance
sales by causing auto parts to fail and sales of seasonal
products to increase.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded
$51million of adjustments that increased cost of sales.
The adjustments consisted of $36million for revision of
estimates for vendor allowances primarily due to lower than
anticipated purchase volumes, and $15million for an
inventory allowance for merchandise we expect to sell in future
periods below cost. The Company also recorded adjustments to incentive compensation
accruals and self-insurance liabilities, which, collectively,
increased operating and administrative expenses approximately
$36million in the fourth quarter of 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded an
adjustment of $122million in closed store expenses. The Company incurred $10million of debt retirement costs
in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to $452million in
the fourth quarter of 2003.

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation, as of January30, 2005, of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in
Rule13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and
procedures have been designed to ensure that information we are
required to disclose in our reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and
forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer concluded that, for the reasons set
forth in Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting set forth in Item8 our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
January30, 2005. In light of the material weaknesses
described in Managements Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, the Company performed additional
analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that our
consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly,
management believes that the financial statements included in
this Form10-K fairly present in all material respects our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting See Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting set forth in Item8,
Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on
our assessment of internal control over financial reporting
which is also set forth in Item8, Consolidated
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Except as noted in Managements Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting set forth in Item8,
there were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our most recently completed
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
