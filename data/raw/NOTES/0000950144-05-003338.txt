ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Innotrac Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Innotrac
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the year then ended. We have also audited the schedule listed in the Index at
 as Schedule II as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. These
consolidated financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audit. The
consolidated financial statements and schedule of Innotrac Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, were audited by other auditors
whose report dated March 30, 2004, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
statements and schedule.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and schedule are free of material misstatement. The Company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no
26 such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and schedule,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements and schedule. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Innotrac Corporation
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the
related schedule present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. s/ BDO Seidman, LLP

32 1.  ORGANIZATION
Innotrac Corporation Innotrac or the Company, a Georgia corporation,
provides order processing, order fulfillment and call center services. The
Company offers inventory management, inbound call center, pick/pack/ship
services, order tracking, transaction processing and returns handling from its
leased facilities in Atlanta, Georgia, Pueblo, Colorado, Reno, Nevada,
Bolingbrook, Illinois, Hebron, Kentucky and New Castle, Delaware.
2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary which was merged into
the Company effective January 1, 2005. The financial statements have been
prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Reclassifications have been made to prior year consolidated statements of cash
flows to conform to the 2004 presentation.
Accounting Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Concentration of Revenues. Revenues earned under the Company contracts with
its telecommunication clients to provide fulfillment of telecommunications
equipment and related order processing and call center support services,
including DSL modems and wireless pagers, accounted for approximately 38%, 42%
and 46% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Revenues generated from the fulfillment of DSL and cable modem
equipment accounted for 20%, 19%, and 19% of the aforementioned totals.
The following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues derived from
each of the Company largest clients for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002. Except for the major clients noted in the following table, no
other single customer provided more than 10% of consolidated revenues during
these years.                     2004    2003    2002
BELLSOUTH - TELECOM EQUIPMENT      145%    185%    187%
- DSL EQUIPMENT        125    130     97
SMITH & HAWKEN              129    132     56
TACTICA                  30    102    168 Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The carrying value of the Company
revolving credit facility approximates fair value given that interest rates
under the facility are based on prevailing market rates. The book value of the
Company accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value.
33 Inventories. Inventories, consisting primarily of telephones and interactive
wireless pagers are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined
by the first-in, first-out method. Substantially all inventory at December 31,
2004 and 2003 is for the account of one client who has indemnified the Company
from substantially all risk associated with such inventory.
Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is determined using straight-line methods over the following estimated useful
lives   Rental equipment             3 years
Computers and software          3-5 years
Machinery and equipment          5-7 years
Furniture and fixtures          7 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the
shorter of the service lives of the improvements or the remaining term of the
lease. Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $49 million, $53 million and $50 million, respectively. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles.Goodwill represents the cost of acquired
enterprises in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets effective January 1, 2002, which changed
the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an
amortization method to an impairment only approach. The Company tests goodwill
annually for impairment at January 1 or sooner if circumstances indicate.
Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value
of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Upon completion of its
analysis for impairment as of January 1, 2005 in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
no impairment was determined to exist at that time. Innotrac goodwill carrying
amount as of December 31, 2004 was $252 million. This asset relates to the
goodwill associated with the Company acquisition of Universal Distribution
Services UDS in December 2000, including the earnout payment made to the
former UDS shareholders in February 2002, and the acquisition of iFulfillment,
Inc. in July 2001.
The Company has intangible assets that continue to be subject to amortization
under the provisions of SFAS No. 142. The intangible assets consist of acquired
customer contracts, which are included in other assets in the Company
Consolidated Balance Sheets and which are amortized over a period of 1 to 5
years on a straight-line basis.At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer contracts, of approximately
$187,000 and $387,000, net of accumulated amortization of approximately $11
million and $873,000, respectively. Amortization expense of these intangible
assets amounted to approximately $202,000, $202,000 and $369,000 during the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets and
certain intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment
would be measured based on a projected cash flow model. If the projected
undiscounted cash flows for the asset are not in excess of the carrying value of
the related asset, the impairment would be determined based upon the excess of
the carrying value of the asset over the projected discounted cash flows for the
asset.
Accounting for Income Taxes. Innotrac utilizes the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded against
deferred tax assets if the Company considers it is more likely than not that
deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance has been
recorded against deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004 see Note 7.
34 Revenue Recognition. Innotrac derives its revenue primarily from two sources:
1 fulfillment operations and 2 the delivery of business services. Innotrac
fulfillment services operations record revenue at the conclusion of the material
selection, packaging and shipping process. Innotrac call center services
business recognizes revenue according to written pricing agreements based on
number of calls, minutes or hourly rate basis. All other revenues are recognized
as services are rendered. As required by the consensus reached in Emerging Issue
Task Force EITF Issue No. 99-19, revenues have been recorded net of the cost
of the equipment for all fee-for-service clients. As required by the consensus
reached in EITF No. 01-14, Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements
Received for Out-of Pocket Expenses Incurred, the Company records
reimbursements received from customers for out-of pocket expenses, primarily
freight and postage fees, as revenue and the associated expense as cost of
revenue.
Cost of Revenues. The primary components of cost of revenues include labor costs
for the fulfillment and call centers, telephone minute fees, and freight and
packaging material costs. Costs related to facilities, equipment, account
services and information technology are included in selling, general and
administrative expense along with other operating costs. As a result of the
Company policy to include facility, account services and information
technology costs in selling, general and administrative expense, our gross
margins may not be comparable to other fulfillment companies.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans. The Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Since the exercise price for all
options granted under those plans was equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost is recognized
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Had compensation cost
for stock options been determined under a fair value based method, in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148, the Company net loss and net loss per share would have been
the following pro forma amounts in 000, except per share data                             YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2004     2003      2002

Pro forma net loss                 $ 677  $ 12,699  $ 5,074
Basic net income loss per share as reported   $ 001   $  104  $  038
Diluted net income loss per share as reported  $ 001   $  104  $  038
Pro forma net loss per share            $ 006  $  110  $  044 Under the fair value based method, compensation cost, net of tax is $787,000 718,000 and $655,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
35 The Company has computed for pro forma disclosure purposes the value of all
options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as prescribed by
SFAS No. 123 using the following weighted average assumptions                       2004      2003      2002
Risk-free interest rate           423%      427%     405%

Expected volatility             751%      804%     866 Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. In the computation
of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding is adjusted for the effect of all potential common stock equivalent
shares.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
123R, Share-Based Payment which revises SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. The revised Statement clarifies and expands SFAS No.
123 guidance in several areas, including measuring fair value, classifying an
award as equity or as a liability, and attributing compensation cost to
reporting periods. The revised statement supercedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and its
related implementation guidance. Under the provisions of SFAS 123R, the
alternative to use APB 25 intrinsic value method of accounting that was
provided in Statement No. 123, as originally issued, is eliminated, and entities
are required to measure liabilities incurred to employees in share-based payment
transactions at fair value. The Company currently accounts for its stock-based
compensation plans under APB 25. Since the exercise price for all options
granted under those plans was equal to the market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant, no compensation cost is recognized. Under the
provision of SFAS No. 123R the Company is permitted to continue the
application of APB 25 until the reporting period ended June 30, 2005, at which
time the Company will adopt the provisions of FAS No. 123R and expense the
unvested awards issued.
3.  SPECIAL CHARGES AND SPECIAL CREDITS
The Company recorded special charges of $343 million during the year ended
December 31, 2000. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had approximately
$0 and $277,000, respectively, in remaining accruals related to the special
charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2000. Cash payments relating
to the special charge accruals for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
were approximately $277,000 and $716,000, respectively.
The Company recognized approximately $30 million of special credits during the
year ended December 31, 2002, related to gains realized on sales of inventory
items which were written off as special charges in previous periods, cash
collected for accounts receivable that were written off as special charges in
previous periods, redeployment of leased computer hardware for which the leases
were fully accrued for as special charges in previous periods, and client
contract amendments which resulted in reduced liabilities. These amounts were
recorded as a reduction in the special charge line item in the consolidated
statements of operations.
During 2002, the Company also recognized an additional $31 million in special
charges. Approximately $24 million of these charges were related to capitalized
hardware and software costs for systems purchased specifically for a potential
new client which were subsequently not utilized as originally planned. The loss
of the potential customer indicated that the carrying value of the asset group
was potentially not recoverable, and therefore, an impairment test under the
provisions of SFAS No. 144 was performed. As fair market value of the asset
group was not readily determinable, a discounted, probability weighted cash flow
model was utilized as a basis to determine fair value. As a result of the cash
flow analysis, a $24
36 million impairment charge was recorded. Of the remaining charges, approximately
$500,000 related to the write-down to net realizable value of specified fixed
assets obtained as part of the December 2000 acquisition of UDS which were being
utilized for one specific customer who ceased conducting business with UDS. The
balance of approximately $200,000 was related to severance costs for positions
which were eliminated.

5.  FINANCING OBLIGATIONS
The Company currently has a revolving credit agreement with a bank maturing in
June 2005. Although the facility has a maximum borrowing limit of $250 million,
the credit facility limits borrowings to a specified percentage of eligible
accounts receivable and inventory, which totaled $156 million at December 31,
2004. The maximum borrowing amount of this facility was reduced from $400
million to $250 million in the third quarter of 2004 as the Company does not
anticipate a need for the larger amount. The Company has granted a security
interest in all of its assets to the lender as collateral under this revolving
credit agreement.
The revolving credit agreement contains various restrictive financial and change
in ownership control covenants. The provisions of the revolving credit agreement
require that the Company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender, and
allow the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately
due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants.
Accordingly, in the event of noncompliance, these amounts could be accelerated.
The lender agreed to increase the limit on annual capital expenditures under the
agreement from $20 million to $30 million for fiscal 2004. Capital
expenditures were $28 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.
The financial covenants require the Company to maintain a minimum fixed charge
coverage ratio of 130 to 100. The Company fixed charge ration at December
31, 2004 was 157 to 100. Additionally, the revolving credit agreement contains
a minimum tangible net worth requirement of $240 million. The Company
tangible net worth at December 31, 2004 was $252 million. Compliance with the
minimum tangible net worth covenant and other financial covenants is determined
on a quarterly basis.
Interest on borrowings is payable monthly at rates equal to the prime rate, or
at the Company option, LIBOR plus up to 225 basis points. On November 13,
2004, the Company fixed $20 million of its $31 million of borrowings at a
90-day LIBOR rate of 378%. Interest expense of approximately $99,000 related to
the 90-day LIBOR was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 the Company also incurred interest
expense related to the variable portion of the line of credit of approximately
$111,000, $704,000 and $266,100, respectively, resulting in a weighted average
interest rate of 348%, 380% and 375%, respectively. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had $125 million of additional availability under the revolving credit
agreement.
37 6.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases. Innotrac leases office and warehouse space and equipment under
various operating leases. The primary office and warehouse operating leases
provide for escalating payments over the lease term. Innotrac recognizes rent
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company also has
capital lease obligations that expire over the next year primarily for warehouse
equipment and computer hardware.
Aggregate future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating and
capital leases with original periods in excess of one year as of December 31,
2004 are as follows in 000                         CAPITAL    OPERATING

Rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately $86 million, $81
million and $61 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.
Legal Proceedings. The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and
claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no material
pending legal proceedings to which the Company is a party.
Shareholder Rights Plan. In December of 1997, the Company Board of Directors
approved a Shareholder Rights Plan the Rights Plan. The Rights Plan provides
for the distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of the Company
Common Stock held of record as of the close of business on January 1, 1998 or
that thereafter becomes outstanding prior to the earlier of the final expiration
date of the Rights or the first date upon which the Rights become exercisable.
Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one
one-hundredth of a share of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock,
par value $10 per share, at a price of $6000 the Purchase Price, subject
to adjustment. The Rights are not exercisable until ten calendar days after a
person or group an Acquiring Person buys, or announces a tender offer for,
15% or more of the Company Common Stock. Such ownership level has been
increased to 40% for a particular shareholder that owned approximately 283% of
the shares outstanding on December 31, 2004. In the event the Rights become
exercisable, each Right will entitle the holder to receive that number of shares
of Common Stock having a market value equal to the Purchase Price. If, after any
person has become an Acquiring Person other than through a tender offer
approved by qualifying members of the Board of Directors, the Company is
involved in a merger or other business combination where the Company is not the
surviving corporation, or the Company sells 50% or more of its assets, operating
income, or cash flow, then each Right will entitle the holder to purchase, for
the Purchase Price, that number of shares of common or other capital stock of
the acquiring entity which at the time of such transaction have a market value
of twice the Purchase Price. The Rights will expire on January 1, 2008, unless
extended, unless the Rights are earlier exchanged, or unless the Rights are
earlier redeemed by the Company in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0001
per Right.
Employment Commitment. In June 1999, in conjunction with the opening of a new
call center facility, the Company entered into an Employment Commitment
Agreement with the City of Pueblo, Colorado                    38 whereby the Company received cash incentives of $968,000. These funds were
accounted for as a reduction in the basis of the assets acquired. In return for
this consideration, the Company is obligated to employ a minimum number of
full-time employees at its Pueblo facility, measured on a quarterly basis. This
obligation, which became effective June 2002, will continue through June 2009.
During 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Company had substantially met the minimum
employee requirements of 359 full-time employees, as measured on a quarterly
basis. In the event that the number of full-time employees fails to meet the
minimum requirement, the Company will incur a quarterly penalty of $9630 for
each employee less than the minimum required amount.
7.  INCOME TAXES
Details of the income tax benefit provision for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows in 000          2004     2003      2002

Deferred       -     8,540      734
$ -    $8,772     $2,578
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of the temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The significant
components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December
31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows in 000                      2004        2003

Innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the
liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between
the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A
valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the Company
considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be
realized. Innotrac gross deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2004 is
approximately $128 million. This deferred tax asset was generated primarily by
net operating loss carryforwards created primarily by the special charge of
$343 million recorded in 2000 and the net losses
39 generated in 2002 and 2003. Innotrac has a tax net operating loss carryforward
of $315 million at December 31, 2004 that expires between 2020 and 2024.
Innotrac ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from
future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions, collection of
existing outstanding accounts receivable, competitive pressures on sales and
margins and other factors beyond management control. These factors, combined
with losses in recent years, creates uncertainty about the ultimate realization
of the gross deferred tax asset in future years. Therefore, a valuation
allowance of approximately $97 million and $99 million has been recorded as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income taxes associated with future
earnings will be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, the deferred income tax provision of $202,000 was
offset by a corresponding reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance. When, and if, the Company can return to consistent profitability and
management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets
prior to their expiration, the valuation allowance can be reduced or eliminated.
The difference between the provision for income taxes benefit and the amount
computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows                           2004   2003    2002

computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, because their effect was anti-dilutive. This includes a warrant
with registration rights issued to Thane International in December 2000 to
purchase 150,000 shares of Innotrac common stock at the exercise price of $650,
which vests 20% annually, which expires December 8, 2010.

10.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
In June 2000, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, at the
direction of senior management, of up to $50 million of the Company common
stock. The stock repurchase program was extended for an additional twelve months
by the Board of Directors in February 2002. During the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased approximately 0, 0 and 205,400
shares at a total cost of $0, $0 and $448,000, respectively.
At December 31, 2003, all treasury shares previously repurchased had been
reissued for stock options exercised during 2003, and accordingly no treasury
stock remains.
11.  EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS
Innotrac employees may participate in a 401k defined contribution plan. The
plan covers all employees who have at least six months of service and are 18
years of age or older. Participants may elect to defer up to 15% of compensation
up to a maximum amount determined annually pursuant to IRS regulations. Prior to
July 1, 2004, Innotrac policy was to provide matching employer contributions
equal to 15% of contributions for less than five years of service, 25% of
contributions for five to nine years of service, and 35% of contributions for
over nine years of service. However, this match was suspended from January 1,
2002 through June 30, 2002, reinstituted from July 1, 2002 through December 31,
2002 and was temporarily suspended thereafter. Effective July 1, 2004 and
through December 31, 2004, Innotrac reinstituted a matching employer
contribution equal to 5% of contributions for less than five years of service,
10% of contributions for five to nine years of service and 15% of contributions
for over nine years of service. These rates were adjusted effective January 1,
2005 to 5% of contributions for less than four years of service and 10% of
contributions for over four years of service. Total matching contributions made
to the plan and charged to expense by Innotrac for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $16,000, $0 and $49,000, respectively.
The Company has an executive deferred compensation plan for certain employees,
as designated by the Company Board of Directors. Participants may elect to
defer up to 30% of compensation. Innotrac policy is to provide matching
employer contributions ranging from 20% to 100% of employee contributions based
on years of service. However, this match was suspended for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
but reinstated effective January 1, 2005 at a match of 5% of contributions for
less than four years of service and 10% of contributions for over four years of
service. The Company invests these contributions in employee-directed marketable
equity securities which are recorded as trading securities at fair-market value
on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other assets and aggregated
$874,865 and $733,446 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The monies
held by the plan are subject to general creditors of the Company in the event of
a Company bankruptcy filing.
41 12.  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has adopted two stock option plans: the 1997 and 2000 Stock Option
and Incentive Award Plans The Plans. The Plans provide key employees,
officers, directors, contractors and consultants an opportunity to own shares of
common stock of the Company and to provide incentives for such persons to
promote the financial success of the Company. Awards under The Plans may be
structured in a variety of ways, including as incentive stock options, as
defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, non-qualified
stock options, restricted stock awards, and stock appreciation rights SARs.
Incentive stock options may be granted only to full-time employees including
officers of the Company. Non-qualified options, restricted stock awards, SARs,
and other permitted forms of awards may be granted to any person employed by or
performing services for the Company, including directors, contractors and
consultants. The 1997 Stock Option Plan and 2000 Stock Option Plan, as amended,
provide for the issuance of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 800,000
shares and 2,800,000 shares of common stock, respectively. At December 31, 2004,
there were 1,581,100 shares available to be issued under The Plans.
Incentive stock options are also subject to certain limitations prescribed by
the Code, including the requirement that such options may not be granted to
employees who own more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of
voting stock of the Company, unless the option price is at least 110% of the
fair market value of the common stock subject to the option. The Board of
Directors of the Company or a committee designated by the Board otherwise
generally has discretion to set the terms and conditions of options and other
awards, including the term, exercise price and vesting conditions, if any; to
select the persons who receive such grants and awards; and to interpret and
administer The Plans.
A summary of the options outstanding and exercisable by price range as of
