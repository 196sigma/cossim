The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial
statements. 24The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements Note1- Nature of
Operations The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries Greenbrier or
the Company currently operates in two primary business
segments: manufacturing and leasing services. The two
business segments are operationally integrated. With operations
in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe, the
manufacturing segment produces double-stack intermodal railcars,
conventional railcars, tank cars, marine vessels and performs
railcar repair, refurbishment and maintenance activities. The
Company also produces rail castings through an unconsolidated
joint venture and also manufactures new freight cars through the
use of unaffiliated subcontractors. The leasing services
segment owns approximately 10,000 railcars and provides
management services for approximately 129,000 railcars for
railroads, shippers and other leasing and transportation
companies. Note2- Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation- The financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances are eliminated upon consolidation. Investments in
and long-term advances to joint ventures in which the Company
has a 50% or less ownership interest are accounted for by the
equity method and included in other assets. Unclassified Balance Sheet- The balance sheets of
the Company are presented in an unclassified format as a result
of significant leasing activities for which the current or
noncurrent distinction is not relevant. In addition, the
activities of the leasing services and manufacturing
segments are so intertwined that, in the opinion of management,
any attempt to separate the respective balance sheet categories
would not be meaningful and may lead to the development of
misleading conclusions by the reader. Foreign currency translation- Operations outside
the United States prepare financial statements in currencies
other than the United States dollar. Revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates for the year, while assets
and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Translation adjustments are accumulated as a separate component
of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income
lossnet of tax. Cash and cash equivalents- Cash is temporarily
invested primarily in bankers acceptances, United States
Treasury bills, commercial paper and money market funds. All
highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. Accounts Receivable- Accounts receivable are stated
net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $25million and
$19million as of August31, 2005 and 2004. Inventories- Inventories are valued at the lower of
cost first-in, first-out or market. Work-in-process includes
material, labor and overhead. Railcars held for sale- Railcars held for sale
consist of new railcars in transit to delivery point or on lease
with the intent to sell and used railcars that will either be
sold or refurbished, placed on lease and then sold. Equipment on operating leases- Equipment on
operating leases is stated at cost. Depreciation to estimated
salvage value is provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of up to thirty-five years. Property, plant and equipment- Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method over estimated useful lives which are as
follows   
Depreciable Life   
Buildings and improvements:
10-25 years
Machinery and equipment
3-15 years
Other
3-7 years
Intangible assets- Loan fees are capitalized and
amortized as interest expense over the life of the related
borrowings. Goodwill is not significant and is included in other
assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if material changes in events or circumstances
arise. Impairment would result in a write down to fair market
value as necessary. Impairment of long-lived assets- When changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of certain long-lived
assets may not be recoverable, the assets will be evaluated for
impairment. If the forecast undiscounted future cash flows are
less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment charge 25The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value will be
recognized in the current period. Maintenance obligations- The Company is responsible
for maintenance on a portion of the managed and owned lease
fleet under the terms of maintenance obligations defined in the
underlying lease or management agreement. The estimated
liability is based on maintenance histories for each type and
age of the railcar. The liability, included in accounts payable
and accrued liabilities, is reviewed periodically and updated
based on maintenance trends and known future repair or
refurbishment requirements. Warranty accruals- Warranty accruals are estimated
and charged to operations to cover a defined warranty period.
The estimated warranty cost is based on history of warranty
claims for each particular product type. For new product types
without a warranty history, preliminary estimates are based on
historical information for similar product types. The warranty
accruals, included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
are reviewed periodically and updated based on warranty trends. Contingent rental assistance- The Company has
entered into contingent rental assistance agreements on certain
railcars, subject to leases, that have been sold to third
parties. These agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum
lease rental, subject to a maximum defined rental assistance
amount, over remaining periods that range from one to seven
years. A liability is established when management believes that
it is probable that a rental shortfall will occur and the amount
can be estimated. All existing rental assistance agreements were
entered into prior to December31, 2002. Any future
contracts would use the guidance required by Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASBInterpretation
FIN45. Income taxes- The liability method is used to
account for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for
the temporary effects of differences between assets and
liabilities recognized for financial statement and income tax
reporting purposes. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax
assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
The Company also provides for income tax contingencies when
management considers them probable of occurring and reasonably
estimable. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss-
Accumulated other comprehensive income lossrepresents
net earnings lossplus all other changes in net assets
from non-owner sources. Revenue recognition- Revenue is recognized when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Railcars are generally manufactured, repaired or refurbished
under firm orders from third parties. Revenue is recognized when
railcars are completed, accepted by an unaffiliated customer and
contractual contingencies removed. Marine revenues are either
recognized on the percentage of completion method during the
construction period or on the completed contract method based on
the terms of the contract. Direct finance lease revenue is
recognized over the lease term in a manner that produces a
constant rate of return on the net investment in the lease.
Operating lease revenue is recognized as earned under the lease
terms. Certain leases are operated under car hire arrangements
whereby revenue is earned based on utilization, car hire rates
and terms specified in the lease agreement. Car hire revenue is
reported from a third party source two months in arrears,
however, such revenue is accrued in the month earned based on
estimates of use from historical activity and is adjusted to
actual as reported. Such adjustments historically have not been
significant from the estimate. Research and development- Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs
incurred for new product development during 2005, 2004 and 2003
were $19million, $30million and $27million. 26The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Forward exchange contracts- Foreign operations give
rise to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Forward exchange contracts with established financial
institutions are utilized to hedge a portion of such risk.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are deferred in other
comprehensive income lossand recognized in earnings
concurrent with the hedged transaction or when the occurrence of
the hedged transaction is no longer considered probable. Even
though forward exchange contracts are entered into to mitigate
the impact of currency fluctuations, certain exposure remains
which may affect operating results. Interest rate instruments- Interest rate swap
agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on certain debt. The net cash amounts paid or
received under the agreements are accrued and recognized as an
adjustment to interest expense. Net earnings per share- Basic earnings per common
share EPSexcludes the potential dilution that would
occur if additional shares were issued upon exercise of
outstanding stock options, while diluted EPS takes this
potential dilution into account using the treasury stock method. Stock-based compensation- Compensation expense for
stock-based employee compensation continues to be measured using
the method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
APBOpinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. In accordance with APB Opinion No25, Greenbrier does not
recognize compensation expense relating to employee stock
options because it only grants options with an exercise price
equal to the fair value of the stock on the effective date of
grant. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation
expense using a fair value approach, the pro forma net earnings
and earnings per share would have been as follows

Compensation expense was determined using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which was developed to
estimate value of independently traded options.
Greenbriers options are not independently traded. 27The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of
the grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model
with the following weighted-average assumptions used for the
grants for the year ending August31, 2003. No options were
granted for the years ended August31, 2004 and 2005.

The value of stock awarded under restricted stock grants is
amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period of two
to five years. Management estimates- The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles requires judgment on the part of management to arrive
at estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently
uncertain, including evaluating the remaining life and
recoverability of long-lived assets. These estimates may affect
the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates
and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted
in future periods. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Reclassifications- Certain reclassifications have
been made to prior years Consolidated Financial Statements
to conform with the 2005 presentation. Prospective Accounting Changes- In December 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo123R, Share Based Payment. This
statement requires all entities to recognize compensation
expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share-based
payments stock options and restricted stock granted to
employees. The Company is required to implement
SFASNo123R as of September1, 2005 and has
determined the implementation will not have a material effect on
its Consolidated Financial Statements as all options were vested
as of August31, 2005 and no further options are expected
to be issued. Restricted stock grants are currently being
recorded as compensation expense over the vesting period. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which replaces
Accounting Principles Board APBopinion No20,
Accounting Changes and SFASNo3, Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. This
statement requires retrospective application, unless
impracticable, for changes in accounting principles in the
absence of transition requirements specific to newly adopted
accounting principles. This statement is effective for any
accounting changes and corrections of errors made beginning
September1, 2006. Note3-
Acquisitions In September 1998 Greenbrier entered into a joint venture with
Bombardier Transportation Bombardier to build railroad freight
cars at a portion of Bombardiers existing manufacturing
facility in Sahagun, Mexico. Each party held a 50%
non-controlling interest in the joint venture. In December 2004,
Greenbrier acquired Bombardiers interest and will pay
Bombardier a purchase price of $90million over five years
and as a result of the allocation of the purchase price among
assets and liabilities, recorded $13million in goodwill.
Greenbrier leases a portion of the plant from Bombardier and has
entered into a service agreement under which Bombardier provides
labor and manufacturing support. These operations, previously
accounted for under the equity method, are consolidated for
financial reporting purposes beginning in December 2004. The balance sheet of the acquired entity at December1,
2004 was as follows

Operations In August 2004, the Company reached a settlement agreement on
litigation initiated in 1998 by the former shareholders of
InterAmerican Logistics, Inc. InterAmerican which was acquired
in 1996 as part of the Companys transportation logistics
segment. The litigation alleged that Greenbrier violated the
agreements pursuant to which it acquired ownership of
InterAmerican. A plan to dispose of the transportation logistics
segment, which included InterAmerican, was adopted in 1997 and
completed in 1998 and accordingly, results of operations for
InterAmerican were reclassified to discontinued operations at
that time. Upon final disposition in 1998, the balance of the
liability for loss on discontinued operations remained pending
resolution of this litigation. In August 2004, the litigation
was settled resulting in the recognition of a $13million
pre-tax gain on discontinued operations $07million, net

Greenbrier has purchased railcars from the joint venture for
subsequent sale or for its lease fleet for which the
Companys portion of margin is eliminated upon
consolidation. In addition, the joint venture paid a management
fee to each owner, of which 50% of the fee earned by Greenbrier
was eliminated upon consolidation. Note12- Revolving
Notes All amounts originating in foreign currency have been translated
at the August31, 2005 exchange rate for the following
discussion. Credit facilities aggregated $1714million as
of August31, 2005. Available borrowings are based on
defined levels of inventory, receivables, leased equipment and
property, plant and equipment, as well as certain consolidated
capitalization, tangible net worth and fixed coverage ratios
which at August31, 2005 levels would provide for maximum
borrowing of $1430million of which $125million is
outstanding. A $1250million revolving line of credit is
available through June 2010 to provide working capital and
interim financing of equipment for the United States and Mexican
operations. A $253million line of credit is available
through June 2010 for working capital for Canadian manufacturing
operations. Lines of credit totaling $211million are
available principally through June 2006 for working capital for
the European manufacturing operation. Advances bear interest at
rates that depend on the type of borrowing and the ratio of debt
to total capitalization, as defined. At August31, 2005,
there were no borrowings outstanding under the North American
credit facilities. The European manufacturing credit line had
$125million outstanding at interest rates of 58% and
59%. Note13- Accounts

On May11, 2005, the Company issued through a private
placement, $1750million aggregate principal amount of
83/8%senior
unsecured notes due 2015 the Notes. In August 2005, the
Company filed a registration statement with respect to an offer
to exchange the Notes for a new issue of identical notes
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Subsequent to August31, 2005, the exchange for the
registered notes was completed. Payment on the Notes is
guaranteed by certain of the Companys domestic
subsidiaries. Interest will be paid semiannually in arrears
commencing November15, 2005. At any time prior to May15, 2008, Greenbrier may redeem up
to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a
redemption price of 1084% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the
redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more
equity offerings. On or after May15, 2010, Greenbrier has
the option to redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at the
redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount
of 1042% in 2010, 1028% in 2011, 1014% in 2012, and 1000% in
2013 and thereafter plus accrued and unpaid interest and
liquidated damages, if any, to the applicable redemption date,
if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
May15th. Upon a change of control, Greenbrier is required
to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding for cash
at 1010% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, to the purchase
date. Term loans are due in varying installments through August 2017
and are collateralized by certain property, plant and equipment.
The weighted average remaining contractual life and weighted
average interest rate of the term loans as of August31,
2005 and 2004 were approximately 65 and 59months and 62%
in 2005 and 68% in 2004. The revolving and operating lines of credit, along with certain
notes payable, contain covenants with respect to the Company and
various subsidiaries, the most restrictive of which, among other
things, limit the ability to incur additional indebtedness or
guarantees; pay dividends; enter into sale leaseback
transactions; create liens; sell assets; engage in transactions
with affiliates; enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of
substantially all the Companys assets; and enter into new
lines of business. The covenants also require certain minimum
levels of tangible net worth, maximum ratios of debt to equity
and minimum levels of interest coverage. Interest rate swap agreements are utilized to reduce the impact
of changes in interest rates on certain debt. At August31,
2005, such agreements had a 32The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents notional amount of $247million and mature between August
2006 and March 2011. Principal payments on the notes payable are as follows

Note16-Subordinated
Debt Subordinated notes, amounting to $86million and
$149million at August31, 2005 and 2004, were issued
to the seller of railcars purchased from 1990 to 1997 as part of
an agreement described in Note26. The notes bear interest
at 90%, with the principal due ten years from the date of
issuance of the notes, and are subordinated to all other
liabilities of a subsidiary. The agreement includes an option
that, under certain conditions, provides for the seller to
repurchase the railcars for the original acquisition cost to the
Company at the date the underlying subordinated notes are due.
The Company has received notice from the seller that the
purchase options will be exercised, and amounts due under the
subordinated notes will be retired from the repurchase proceeds. Note17-Derivative
Instruments Foreign operations give rise to market risks from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency forward
exchange contracts with established financial institutions are
utilized to hedge a portion of that risk. Interest rate swap
agreements are utilized to reduce the impact of changes in
interest rates on certain debt. The Companys foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap
agreements are designated as cash flow hedges, and therefore the
unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss. At August31, 2005 exchange rates, forward exchange
contracts for the sale of United States dollars aggregated
$666million, Pound Sterling aggregated $57million
and Euro aggregated $145million. Adjusting these
contracts to the fair value of these cash flow hedges at
August31, 2005 resulted in an unrealized pre-tax gain of
$34million that was recorded in the line item accumulated
other comprehensive loss. As these contracts mature at various
dates through March 2006, any such gain or loss remaining will
be recognized in manufacturing revenue along with the related
transactions. In the event that the underlying sales transaction
does not occur or does not occur in the period designated at the
inception of the hedge, the amount classified in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss would be reclassified to the
current years results of operations. At August31, 2005 exchange rates, interest rate swap
agreements had a notional amount of $247million and
mature between August 2006 and March 2011. The fair value of
these cash flow hedges at August31, 2005 resulted in an
unrealized pre-tax loss of $15million. The loss is
included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the fair
value of the contracts is included in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As
interest expense on the underlying debt is recognized, amounts
corresponding to the interest rate swaps are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income loss and charged or
credited to interest expense. At August31, 2005 interest
rates, approximately $05million would be reclassified to
interest expense in the next 12months. Note18-
Stockholders Equity On May11, 2005, the Company issued 5,175,000shares
of its common stock at a price of $2650per share, less
underwriting commissions, discounts and expenses. Proceeds were
used to purchase3,504,167shares from the estate of
Alan James, former member of the board of directors, and
1,837,500shares from William Furman, President and Chief
Executive Officer. After the offering, the estate of Alan James
owned 28% and William Furman owned 139% of the outstanding
common stock of the Company. A stock incentive plan was adopted July1, 1994 the 1994
Plan that provides for granting compensatory and
non-compensatory options to employees and others. No further
grants will be awarded under this plan. On April6, 1999, the Company adopted the Stock Incentive
Plan 2000 the 2000 Plan, under which 1,000,000shares of
common stock were made available for issuance with respect to
options granted to employees, non-employee directors and
consultants 33The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents of the Company. The 2000 Plan
authorized the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory
stock options, and restricted stock awards, or any combination
of the foregoing. Under the 2000 Plan, the exercise price for
incentive stock options could not be less than the market value
of the Companys common stock at the time the option is
granted. Grants for 2,500shares remain available under
this plan. In 2005, vesting was accelerated on all outstanding
options on this plan in an effort to reduce administrative
expenses associated with the implementation of FASB 123R as the
remaining unvested portion of options was immaterial and no
further options were expected to be issued. If the vesting of
the options had not been accelerated, the impact to the
Companys Statement of Operations would be an additional
expense of $01million in 2006 with an after-tax impact of
$0004per share. The effect would be minimal for periods
after 2006. In January 2005, the stockholders approved the 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan. The plan provides for the grant of incentive
stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted shares,
stock units and stock appreciation rights. The maximum aggregate
number of the Companys common shares available for
issuance under the plan is 1,300,000. During 2005, the Company
awarded restricted stock grants totaling 353,864shares
under the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan. The following table summarizes stock option transactions for

Party Transactions James-Furman Company Partnership. Alan James,
former member of the Board of Directors, and William Furman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company were
partners in a general partnership, James-Furman
Company the Partnership, that, among other things, engaged in
the ownership, leasing and marketing of railcars and programs
for refurbishing and marketing of used railcars. As a result of
Mr.James death, the Partnership was dissolved as of
January28, 2005. In 1989, the Company entered into
presently existing agreements with the Partnership pursuant to
which the Company manages and maintains railcars owned by the
Partnership in exchange for a fixed monthly fee that is no less
favorable to the Company than the fee the Company could obtain
for similar services 34The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents rendered to unrelated parties. The maintenance and management
fees paid to the Company under such agreements for the years
ended August31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 aggregated
$01million per year. In addition, the Partnership paid
the Company fees of $01million in each of the years ended
August31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 for administrative and other
services. The management and maintenance agreements presently in
effect between the Company and the Partnership provide that in
remarketing railcars owned by the Partnership and the Company,
as well as by unaffiliated lessors, the Company will, subject to
the business requirements of prospective lessees and railroad
regulatory requirements, grant priority to that equipment which
has been off-lease and available for the longest period of time.
Such agreements also provide that the Partnership will grant to
the Company a right of first refusal with respect to any
opportunity originated by the Partnership in which the Company
may be interested involving the manufacture, purchase, sale,
lease, management, refurbishing or repair of railcars. The right
of first refusal provides that prior to undertaking any such
transaction the Partnership must offer the opportunity to the
Company and must provide the disinterested, independent members
of the Board of Directors a period of not less than 30days
in which to determine whether the Company desires to pursue the
opportunity. The right of first refusal in favor of the Company
continues for a period of 12months after the date that
both of Messrs.James and Furman cease to be officers or
directors of the Company. Prior to Mr.James death,
the Partnership had advised the Company that it did not expect
to pursue acquisitions of additional railcars. It has not yet
been determined how the agreements between the Company and the
Partnership will be addressed due to the Partnerships
dissolution. Indebtedness of Management-Since the
beginning of the Companys last fiscal year, no director or
executive officer of the Company has been indebted to the
Company for an amount in excess of $60 thousand except that the
President of the Companys manufacturing operations is
indebted in the amount of $02million under the terms of a
promissory note payable upon demand and secured by a mortgage.
The note does not bear interest and has not been amended since
issuance of the note. Policy- Greenbriers policy is that all
proposed transactions by the Company with directors, officers,
five percent stockholders and their affiliates be entered into
only if such transactions are on terms no less favorable to
Greenbrier than could be obtained from unaffiliated parties, are
reasonably expected to benefit the Company and are approved by a
majority of the disinterested, independent members of the
Companys board of directors. Litigation- On July26, 2004, Mr.James,
then-Chairman of Greenbriers board of directors, filed an
action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against
the Company and all of its then existing directors other than
Mr.James. The action sought rescission of the stockholder
rights agreement, alleging, among other things, that directors
breached their fiduciary duties in adopting the rights agreement
and that adopting the rights agreement breached the
right-of-first refusal provisions of the Stockholders
Agreement among Mr.James, WilliamA. Furman and the
Company. Subsequently, the action was amended to remove the
claims regarding the stockholders agreement. The lawsuit
did not seek monetary damages. On April19, 2005, the
Estate was substituted as a plaintiff in this litigation. The
settlement agreement required the Estate to cause the dismissal,
with prejudice, of all claims in this litigation. On
April20, 2005, the parties to the litigation filed with
the Delaware court the order approving the stipulation and
dismissal of the Delaware litigation. The Delaware court granted
that order on April21, 2005. Purchases from unconsolidated subsidiaries- The
Company purchased railcars totaling $10million for the
three months ended November30, 2004 and $318million
for the year ended August31, 2004 from a 50%-owned joint
venture for subsequent sale or for its own lease fleet. No cars
were purchased from the joint venture for the year ended
August31, 2003. As a result of the acquisition of the
Companys joint venture partners interest on
December1, 2004, the financial results of the entity were
consolidated for the last three quarters of 2005. See
Note3 for discussion of the acquisition. Note21- Employee
Benefit Plans Defined contribution plans are available to substantially all
United States employees. Contributions are based on a percentage
of employee contributions and amounted to $12million 12million and $10million for the years ended
August31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Defined benefit pension plans are provided for Canadian
employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. The plans
provide pension benefits based on years of credited service.
Contributions to the plan are actuarially determined and are
intended 35The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents to fund the net periodic pension
cost. Expenses resulting from contributions to the plans were
$21million, $19million and $13million for
the years ended August31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Nonqualified deferred benefit plans exist for certain employees.
Expenses resulting from contributions to the plans were
$16million, $16million and $13million for
the years ended August31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Note22- Income

United States income taxes have not been provided for
approximately $132million of cumulative undistributed
earnings of several non-United States subsidiaries as Greenbrier
plans to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations
outside the United States. The Internal Revenue Service IRS is currently conducting an
audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the
years ended 1999 through 2002. In connection with the audit, the
IRS is reviewing the Companys decision to take a tax
deduction on the 2002 federal tax return in the amount of
$526million relating to European operations, which
resulted in a $215million tax benefit reported in the
2002 Consolidated Financial Statements. The IRS has not
completed its examination. However, upon completion of its
audit, the IRS may propose to disallow some or all of the
deduction in that year. The Company would have rights of appeal
within the IRS and in the courts. 36The

39The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Note26- Commitments
and Contingencies In 1990, an agreement was entered into for the purchase and
refurbishment of over 10,000 used railcars between 1990 and
1997. The agreement provides that, under certain conditions, the
seller will receive a percentage of defined earnings of a
subsidiary, and further defines the period when such payments
are to be made. Such amounts are referred to as participation,
are accrued when earned and charged to leasing
services cost of revenue. Unpaid amounts are included in
participation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participation
expense was $16million, $17million and
$27million in 2005, 2004 and 2003. Payment of
participation was $168million in 2005 and is estimated to
be $121million in 2006, $90million in 2007 34million in 2008, $02million in 2009 and minimal
thereafter. Environmental studies have been conducted of the Companys
owned and leased properties that indicate additional
investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be
necessary. The Companys Portland, Oregon manufacturing
facility is located on the Willamette River. The United States
Environmental Protection Agency EPA has classified portions of
the river bed, including the portion fronting Greenbriers
facility, as a federal National Priority List or
Superfund site due to sediment contamination the
Portland Harbor Site. Greenbrier and more than 60 other
parties, have received a General Notice of potential
liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The
letter advised the Company that they may be liable for the costs
of investigation and remediation which liability may be joint
and several with other potentially responsible parties as well
as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of
hazardous substances to the site. At this time, ten private and
public entities have signed an Administrative Order on Consent
to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study of the
Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and five additional
entities have not signed such consent, but are nevertheless
contributing money to the effort. The study is expected to be
completed in 2007. In addition, the Company has entered into a
Voluntary Clean-Up Agreement with the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality in which the Company agreed to conduct an
investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present
operations at the Companys Portland property may have
released hazardous substances to the environment. Under this
oversight, the Company is also conducting groundwater
remediation relating to a historical spill on its property. Because these investigations are still underway, the Company is
unable to determine the amount of ultimate liability relating to
these matters. Based on the results of the pending
investigations and future assessments of natural resource
damages, Greenbrier may be required to incur costs associated
with additional phases of investigation or remedial action, and
may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, the
Company may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging
in order to continue to launch vessels from its launch ways on
the river, and the rivers classification as a Superfund
site could result in some limitations on future dredging and
launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect
the Companys business and results of operations, or the
value of its Portland property. On April20, 2004, BC Rail Partnership initiated litigation
against the Company in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
alleging breach of contract and negligent manufacture and design
of railcars which were involved in a derailment. No trial date
has been set. On November3, 2004, and November4, 2004, in the
District Court of Tarrant County, Texas, and in the District
Court of Lancaster County, Nebraska, respectively, litigation
was initiated against the Company by BNSF. BNSF alleges the
failure of a component part on a railcar manufactured by
Greenbrier in 1988, resulted in a derailment and a chemical
spill. The complaint alleges in excess of $140million in
damages. Answers have been filed in both cases and the parties
have agreed to stay the Nebraska action and proceed with the
litigation in Texas. No trial date has been set. On September23, 2004, two current employees and one former
employee of the Company filed a civil complaint in Multnomah
County Circuit Court, State of Oregon, alleging that the Company
failed to comply with Oregon wage and hour laws. Plaintiffs seek
injunctive relief and unspecified unpaid wages, penalty wages,
costs, disbursements and attorneys fees. The parties have
participated in mediation proceedings, and are in settlement
negotiations. No trial date has been set. On June27, 2005, an individual initiated litigation
against Union Pacific alleging general and economic damages in
the amount of $05million and $10million,
respectively, for personal injuries 40The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents incurred while operating a handbrake on a railcar operating on
Union Pacifics lines. On September16, 2005, Union
Pacific initiated litigation against various Greenbrier entities
claiming indemnity and contribution. Discovery is continuing and
no trial date has been set. Management intends to vigorously defend its position in each of
the foregoing cases and believes that any ultimate liability
resulting from the above litigation will not materially affect
the Companys financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, the Company is involved as a defendant in
other litigation in the ordinary course of business. While the
ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be determined
at this time, management believes that the resolution of these
actions will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial condition or results of operation. On July26, 2004, Alan James, a former member of
Greenbriers board of directors, filed an action in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company
and all of its directors serving on July26, 2004, other
than Mr.James. Mr.James passed away on
January28, 2005. On April20, 2005, all of the claims
and allegations against Greenbrier were dismissed with prejudice. On April20, 2005, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with Mr.Furman, President and Chief Executive
Officer. The employment agreement provides that Greenbrier pay
Mr.Furman a base salary of $550,000per year subject
to increase by the compensation committee of the board of
directors, an annual performance based cash bonus up to 150% of
his base salary, and an annual retirement benefit of $407,000
commencing in November 2004 and continuing until Mr.Furman
reaches age70. Either party may terminate the employment
agreement at any time upon written notice. The employment agreement contains a two year non-compete clause
limiting Mr.Furmans activities with competing
businesses upon termination. In the event of his termination
following a change in control, Mr.Furman will be entitled
to a lump sum severance amount equal to three times his base
salary and average bonus, accrued salary and vacation, and
continuation for three years of specified employee benefits. The
Company has also granted Mr.Furman registration rights for
a period of five years following termination of employment, as
long as he continues to hold at least 10% of the Companys
outstanding shares of common stock and desires to sell at least
500,000 of such shares. Greenbrier and one of its European customers have raised
performance concerns regarding a component that the Company has
installed in 372 railcars produced in Europe. The supplier of
the component has effectively filed for the United Kingdom
equivalent of bankruptcy protection. The customer is seeking a
price adjustment on cars which have been delivered and is
resisting further deliveries. The Company disputes the
customers position and is continuing to address
performance of the component. Given the condition of the
supplier, Greenbriers recourse against the supplier may be
limited or of no value. The Internal Revenue Service IRS is currently conducting an
audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for the
years ended 1999 through 2002. In connection with the audit, the
IRS is reviewing the Companys decision to take a tax
deduction on the 2002 federal tax return in the amount of
$526million relating to European operations, which
resulted in a $215million tax benefit reported in the
2002 Consolidated Financial Statements. The IRS has not
completed its examination. However, upon completion of its
audit, the IRS may propose to disallow some or all of the
deduction in that year. The Company would have rights of appeal
within the IRS and in the courts. The Company has entered into contingent rental assistance
agreements, aggregating $119million, on certain railcars
subject to leases that have been sold to third parties. These
agreements guarantee the purchasers a minimum lease rental,
subject to a maximum defined rental assistance amount, over
periods that range from one to seven years. A liability is
established and revenue is reduced in the period during which a
determination can be made that it is probable that a rental
shortfall will occur and the amount can be estimated. For the
years ended August31, 2005 and 2004 no accruals were made
to cover estimated obligations as the existing liability was
adequate. For the year ended August31, 2003 09million was accrued. There is no liability accrued at
August31, 2005. All of these agreements were entered into
prior to December31, 2002 and have not been modified
since. The accounting for any future rental assistance
agreements will comply with the guidance required by FASB
Interpretation FIN45 which pertains to contracts entered
into or modified subsequent to December31, 2002. 41The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents A portion of leasing services revenue is derived from
car hire which is a fee that a railroad pays for the
use of railcars owned by other railroads or third parties. Car
hire earned by a railcar is usually made up of hourly and
mileage components. Until 1992, the Interstate Commerce
Commission directly regulated car hire rates by prescribing a
formula for calculating these rates. Government regulation of
car hire rates continues but the system of prescribed rates has
been superseded by a system known as deprescription. A ten-year
period used to phase in this new system ended on January1,
2003. Deprescription is a system whereby railcar owners and
users have the right to negotiate car hire rates. If the railcar
owner and railcar user cannot come to an agreement on a car hire
rate then either party has the right to call for arbitration. In
arbitration either the owners or users rate is
selected and that rate becomes effective for a one-year period. There is some risk that car hire rates could be negotiated or
arbitrated to lower levels in the future. This could reduce
future car hire revenue for the Company which amounted to
$253million, $272million and $243million in
2005, 2004 and 2003. In accordance with customary business practices in Europe, the
Company has $108million in bank and third party
performance, advance payment and warranty guarantee facilities,
all of which have been utilized as of August31, 2005. To
date no amounts have been drawn under these performance, advance
payment and warranty guarantee facilities. At August31, 2005, an unconsolidated subsidiary had
$80million of third party debt, for which the Company has
guaranteed 33% or approximately $27million. In the event
that there is a change in control or insolvency by any of the
three 33% investors that have guaranteed the debt, the remaining
investors share of the guarantee will increase
proportionately. The Company has outstanding letters of credit aggregating
$18million associated with material purchases and
facility leases. Greenbrier has jointly committed with Babcock Brown
Rail Management, LLC to purchase new railcars from unaffiliated
manufacturers to be leased to third party customers.
Greenbriers remaining portion of this commitment is
approximately $940million. Note27- Fair Value

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and

liabilities, foreign currency forward contracts and interest
rate swaps is a reasonable estimate of fair value of these
financial instruments. Estimated rates currently available to
the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities
are used to estimate the fair value of notes payable and
subordinated debt. The fair value of deferred participation is
estimated by discounting the estimated future cash payments
using the Companys estimated incremental borrowing rate. Note28-

Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries the
Company as of August31, 2005 and 2004, and
the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Greenbrier Companies, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
August31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended August31, 2005, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of August31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
November3, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte Touche LLP Portland, Oregon November3, 2005 Item1.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the
participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this report pursuant to Rule13a-15b under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act. Based on
that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective in ensuring that information required
to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is
1recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a
timely manner, and 2accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our President and Chief Executive and
Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes In Internal Controls There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Management of the Greenbrier Companies, Inc. together with its
consolidated subsidiaries the Company, is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision
of the Companys principal executive and principal
financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Companys financial statements for external reporting
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. As of the end of the Companys 2005 fiscal year, management
conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on the framework established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We
have excluded from our evaluation the internal control over
financial reporting of the Mexican operation, which was acquired
on December1, 2004. As of and for the period from
December1, 2004 through August31, 2005, total assets
and total revenues subject to the Mexican operation internal
control over financial reporting represented 69% and 144% of
our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for
the year ended August31, 2005. Based on this assessment,
management has determined that the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of August31, 2005 is
effective. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report appearing below, which expresses
unqualified opinions on managements assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of August31, 2005. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls The Companys management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our
disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the control systems objectives will be met. The
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due
to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and
instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also
be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in
part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls
effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures. 55The
Greenbrier Companies 2005 Annual Report Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that The Greenbrier Companies,
Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2005, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. As described in Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management
excluded from their assessment the internal control over
financial reporting at Greenbrier-Concarril, which was acquired
on December1, 2004 and whose financial statements reflect
total assets and revenues constituting 69 and
144percent, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
August31, 2005. Accordingly, our audit did not include the
internal control over financial reporting at
Greenbrier-Concarril. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of August31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
August31, 2005, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
August31, 2005 of the Company and our report dated
November3, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements. Deloitte Touche LLP Portland, Oregon November3, 2005 56The
