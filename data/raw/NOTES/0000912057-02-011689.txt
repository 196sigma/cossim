AEROGEN,INC.      a development stage enterprise      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
NOTE 1FORMATION AND BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY: 
AeroGen,Inc., the Company, was incorporated in the state of California on November18, 1991 to develop products using an aerosol generator to
aerosolize liquids. The Company was reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1998. At the time of the reincorporation, the Company outstanding California corporation preferred and common stock was
exchanged on a one-for-one basis for Delaware corporation preferred and common stock. The related change in par value was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in
capital and common stock. 
The
Company is a development stage enterprise and since inception has devoted substantially all of its efforts to developing its products, including engaging in research and development
activities with and without partners, raising capital and recruiting personnel. The Company has incurred net losses since inception and is expected to incur substantial losses for the next several
years. To date, the Company has funded its operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, research and development payments from partners and interest income. The process of developing
products will continue to require significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. These activities, together with selling, general and administrative expenses, are
expected to result in substantial operating losses for the next several years. These
financial statements contemplate the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Management believes its cash and cash equivalents
and available for-sale securities as of December31, 2001 will be sufficient to meet the Company capital and operating requirements for the next 12months. The Company will
require additional financing in the future and may raise funds by selling shares of its common or preferred stock through private placement or public offering, by collaborative relationships or other
arrangements. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company. Additional equity or debt financing may involve substantial dilution to the Company stockholders, restrictive
covenants or high interest costs. Collaborative arrangements, if necessary to raise additional funds, may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain products, technologies or marketing
territories. The failure to raise needed funds on sufficiently favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, operating results and financial condition. 
The
Company long term liquidity also depends upon its ability to attract and maintain collaborative relationships, to increase revenues from the sale of its products, to develop and
market new products and ultimately, to achieve profitability. 
NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
Basis of consolidation 
In May2000, the Company acquired Cerus Limited, which became the Company wholly-owned subsidiary in Ireland, AeroGen Ireland Limited see
Note9. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
48  financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
include money market and deposit accounts. 
Available-for-sale securities 
All investments are classified as available-for-sale and therefore are carried at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on such
securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity deficit. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings and computed using the specific
identification cost method. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis or market value. 
Depreciation and amortization 
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided on a straight-line basis over the life of the related asset or
the lease term, if shorter. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is
reflected in operations. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets primarily consist of goodwill and acquired workforce related to the acquisition of Cerus Limited and were amortized on a
straight-line basis to operations over six and two years, respectively, through December31, 2001. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards No142
FAS142, goodwill and other intangible assets will not be systematically amortized, but rather, beginning with fiscal year 2002, the Company will perform an annual assessment for impairment
by applying a fair-value-based test. 
Impairment of long-lived assets 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might
not be recoverable. When such an event occurs, management determines whether there has been an impairment by comparing the anticipated
undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, the asset is written down to fair value, which is determined based either on discounted
cash flows or appraised value, depending on the nature of the asset. 
49  Concentration of credit risk and other risks and uncertainties 
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in accounts with three financial institutions in the United States and one financial institution in Ireland.
Deposits in these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. 
Carrying
amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. 
Each
product developed by the Company generally will require the approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA and/or international regulatory agencies prior to the
first commercial sale of the product. The Company cannot be assured that its products will receive the necessary approvals. If the Company is denied approval or if approval is delayed, this may have a
material adverse impact on the Company. 
The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the pharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection
of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, product liability and the need to obtain additional financing. 
Four
companies accounted for 36%, 31%, 21% and 12% of accounts receivable at December31, 2001. One of these companies accounted for 76% of revenues during the year ended
December31, 2001. The agreement with this company terminated in December2001. Another company accounted for 13% of revenues during the year ended December31, 2001. 
One
company accounted for 90% of accounts receivable at December31, 2000 and two companies accounted for 50% and 47% of revenues during the year ended December31, 2000. 
Three
companies accounted for 75%, 11% and 11% of revenues during the year ended December31, 1999. Revenue recognition 
Research and development revenues, which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities, are recorded as the
related expenses are incurred. Charges to the third parties are based upon negotiated rates for full time equivalent employees of the Company and actual out-of-pocket costs.
Rates for full time equivalent employees are intended to approximate the Company anticipated costs. Payments received that are related to future performance are recorded as deferred revenue, and are
recognized as revenues as they are earned. None of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful. Revenues
from product sales are recognized at the time of product shipment, provided an enforceable claim exists, any significant rights to return product have expired and that
collection of the receivable is probable. 
Royalty
revenues are recorded as earned. 
50  Research and development costs 
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Any expenditures associated with products not yet approved by regulatory authorities are
expensed. Certain research and development projects are funded under agreements with third parties, and the costs related to these activities are included in research and development expense. 
Foreign currency translation 
The Company Irish subsidiary uses its local currency as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the
balance sheet date and income and expense accounts at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders' equity. 
Income taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, SFAS, No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be
realized. 
Segments 
The Company operates in one segment, using one measurement of profitability to manage its business. As of December31, 2001 and 2000, 70% and 48 respectively, of all long-lived assets were maintained in the United States. For the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, and for the cumulative period from
November18, 1991 date of inception to December31, 2001, 97%, 99%, 100% and 98%, respectively, of revenues were generated in the United States. 
Accounting for stock-based compensation 
The Company uses the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No44 FIN 44 Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB No25,
in accounting for its employee stock options, and presents disclosure of pro forma information required under SFAS No123,Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue
No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services which require that such
equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the date of grant. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the
underlying equity instruments vest. 
51  Comprehensive income loss 
Comprehensive income loss generally represents all changes in stockholders' equity deficit except those resulting from investments or contributions by
stockholders. The Company unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation gains and losses represent the only components of
comprehensive income loss that are excluded from the Company net loss for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 and for the cumulative period from November18, 1991 date
of inception to December31, 2001. 
Net loss per common share 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of vested common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed giving effect to all potential dilutive common shares, including options, warrants and convertible preferred stock. Options, warrants and
convertible preferred stock were not included in the diluted net loss per share calculations because the effect would be antidilutive. A
reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per common share follows: Years Ended December 31 2001
2000

32 Recent accounting pronouncements 
In July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No141 Business Combinations which establishes financial accounting
and reporting for business combinations and supersedes APB Opinion No16, Business Combinations, and FASB Statement No38, Accounting for Preacquisition Contingencies of Purchased
Enterprises. SFAS No141 requires that all business combinations be accounted for using one method, the purchase method. The provisions apply to all business combinations initiated after
June30, 2001. 
In
July2001, the FASB issued SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, SFAS No142 which establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No17, Intangible Assets. SFAS No142 addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group
of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition, and after they have been initially recognized in the
financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No142 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2001. In accordance with SFAS No142, beginning January1,
2002, goodwill will not be systematically amortized but rather, the Company will perform an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. The Company will also
reclassify the unamortized balance of acquired workforce to goodwill. 
In
October2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144 SFAS No144,Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2001 and interim periods within those fiscal periods. SFAS No144 supersedes FASB Statement No121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and APB 30, Opinion 30 Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment
of a Business and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions Relating to Extraordinary Items, however, SFAS No144 retains the requirement of Opinion 30 to
report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale, by abandonment, or in a
distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale. SFAS No144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of certain long-lived assets and for
long-lived assets to be disposed of. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of implementation on the Company financial position and results of operations. 
53  NOTE 3LITIGATION SETTLEMENT 
In October2001, the Company settled a lawsuit brought by the Company against Becton, Dickinson and Company BD. As a result of the settlement, the
Company owns all of the intellectual property developed by either party under the now terminated agreement, and BD has a nonexclusive license to certain technology developed by BD under the agreement
for use outside the field of inhaled insulin.
Under the settlement agreement, the Company paid BD a total of $20million, in equal installments in October2001 and February2002. The litigation settlement was immediately
expensed to operations, as the technology acquired will be used in conjunction with a product that has not yet been approved for sale by regulatory authorities.

Facility lease 
In October2001 the Company leased facilities in Mountain View, CA under an operating lease that expires in 2012. The Company has contracted for certain
improvements to be made on this new facility. The improvements are estimated to cost approximately $30million. 
The
Company will maintain its facilities in Sunnyvale, CA through June2002, when it anticipates the move into the Mountain View facility will be completed. Minimum rental
commitments under all non-cancelable operating leases in effect at December31, 2001 were: Years ending

Company leases its office facilities in Ireland on a month-to-month basis. Subsequent to year-end the Company entered into a 980year land
lease from the Irish Development Agency for 07 acres for approximately $183,000. At this time the Company has not determined if and/or when it will build on the land. 
Under
the terms of the Mountain View lease, the Company is required to provide security to the landlord in the form of a $12million letter of credit to remain in effect for the
entire length of the lease. The letter of credit is secured by investments of $12million, which are included in other assets at December31, 2001. Under
the terms of the Sunnyvale lease, the Company may be obligated to return certain portions of the facility to shell condition at the end of the lease and to provide the lessor with
a letter of credit in the amount of $90,000. The estimated cost of this demolition work $100,000 is included in accrued liabilities at December31, 2001 and 2000. The letter of credit is
secured by a term deposit of $90,000, which is included in other current assets at December31, 2001 and 2000. 
Rent
expense for 2001, 2000 and 1999 and for the cumulative period from November18, 1991 date of inception to December31, 2001 was approximately $1,148,000, $776,000
and $565,000, and $3,395,000, respectively. 
Executive Severance Benefit Plan 
In September2000, the Board of Directors adopted the Executive Severance Benefit Plan Severance Plan, which provides the Company officers with
severance benefits upon the involuntary termination of their employment in certain circumstances following an acquisition of the Company. Benefits under the plan include salary continuation, health
benefits and option acceleration. 
56  
Contingencies 
From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to additional claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Management is not
currently aware of any matters that will have a material adverse affect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. 
NOTE 7CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK: 
During 2000, the Company issued preferred stock in conjunction with certain research and development agreements and in conjunction with the acquisition of Cerus
Limited see Note9. In July2000, the Company issued 7,498,223 shares of SeriesF convertible preferred stock at $225 per share for gross proceeds of $16,871,002. Certain of
these issuances resulted in charges associated with the beneficial conversion feature of $16,516,574, calculated in accordance with EITF No98-5, Accounting for Convertible
Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features. These charges were reflected as preferred stock dividends in the Statement of Operations for the year ended December31, 2000. 
Concurrent
with the closing of the Company initial public offering in November2000, all outstanding shares of preferred stock 39,010,653 shares were converted into 13,003,514
shares of common stock of the Company.

Convertible preferred stock 
As of December31, 2001 and 2000 the Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0001 par value, none of which was issued and
outstanding. 
Common stock 
Each share of common stock has the right to one vote. The holders of common stock are also entitled to receive dividends whenever funds are legally available and
when declared by the Board of Directors, subject to the prior rights of holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights as to dividends. No dividends have been declared or paid as
of December31, 2001. 
57  The
Company issued shares of its common stock to certain employees under stock purchase and other agreements, some of which contain repurchase provisions in the event of termination of
service with the Company. The shares are generally released from repurchase provisions ratably over two to four years. Included in common stock as of December31, 2001 and 2000 are 69,453 and
306,972 shares subject to repurchase, respectively. 
Stock Option Plans 
The Company has reserved shares of common stock for issuance under several stock incentive plans the Plans. Under the Plans, the Board of Directors may issue
incentive stock options to employees and nonstatutory stock options to employees, consultants or nonemployee directors of the Company, and stock purchase rights to employees, nonemployee directors, or
consultants. The Board of Directors has the authority to determine to whom options will be granted, the number of shares, the term and exercise price which cannot be less than fair market value at
date of grant for incentive stock options or 85% of fair market value for nonstatutory stock options. Prior to the Company initial public offering, fair market value was determined by the Board of
Directors. If an employee owns stock representing more than 10% of the outstanding shares, the price of each share must be at least 110% of fair market value, as determined by the Board of Directors.
All options granted prior to December14, 2000 are immediately exercisable, generally vest over four years, and expire ten years from date of grant. Unvested shares obtained by early exercise
are subject to repurchase by the Company upon termination of the holder service to the Company. At December31, 2001 and 2000, 63,619 and 201,234 shares of common stock, respectively, were
subject to the Company repurchase rights. 
At
the date of the stockholders' meeting in 2001, and annually thereafter, the authorized shares available for issuance under the Company 2000 stock plan will automatically be increased
by a number of shares equal to the lesser of 45% of the then outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, 2,000,000 shares, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Board of
Directors. 
In
August2000, the Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan 2000 Non-Employee Plan under which 250,000 shares of
common stock were reserved for issuance. The stockholders approved the 2000 Non-Employee Plan in November2000. Under the terms of the 2000 Non-Employee Plan, each new
non-employee director elected on or after the effectiveness of an initial public offering of the Company common stock, will be granted an option to purchase 15,000 shares of common
stock, which vest over a 3year period. In addition, on an annual basis, on the date of the annual stockholder meeting, each non-employee director will be granted an option to
purchase 5,000 shares of common stock which vest over a three year period. The exercise price of an option will be the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and the term will be
10years.

In November2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan authorizing the issuance of 250,000 shares of
common stock pursuant to purchase rights granted to employees in the United States. 
At
the date of the stockholders' meeting in 2001, and annually thereafter for a period of 20years, the share reserve will automatically be increased by a number of shares equal
to the least of 10% of the then outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis, 250,000 shares, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Board of Directors. 
The
Purchase Plan is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As of the
December31, 2001, 187,876 shares of common stock have been purchased under the Purchase Plan and 267,011 shares remain available for purchase. 
The
Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. The price at which stock is purchased
under the purchase plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the subsequent designated purchase
dates, whichever is lower. 
60  
Pro forma disclosure 
The Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No123. Since the Company became a public entity in 2000, the fair value of all options
granted subsequent to the initial public offering are calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company previously calculated the fair value of each option on the date of grant
using the minimum value method as prescribed by SFAS No123. The assumptions used are primarily as follows: Years Ended December 31 2001

weighted average grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS123, of options granted during the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $342, $166, and $010
per share, respectively. Years Ended December 31 2001

December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively. 
61  Pro forma net loss and net loss per share 
Had compensation costs been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date, consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No123, for
awards granted under its stock option plans and stock purchase plan, the Company pro forma net loss and pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share under SFAS No123 would have been as
follows: Years Ended December 31 2001

above pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the pro forma effect in future years because options vest over several years and additional grants may be made each year. 
Deferred stock-based compensation 
During 2000 and 1999, the Company issued options to certain employees under the Plans with exercise prices below the deemed fair market value of the Company
common stock at the date of grant. In accordance with the requirements of APB 25, the Company has recorded deferred stock-based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock
options and the deemed fair market value of the Company stock at the date of grant. This deferred stock-based compensation is amortized to expense on a straight line basis, over the period during
which the Company right to repurchase the stock lapses or the options become vested, generally four years. As of December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 the Company had recorded cumulative deferred
compensation related to these options in the amounts of $5,755,000, $6,092,000 and $332,000, net of cancellations, respectively, of which $1,168,000, $584,000 and $9,000 had been amortized to expense
during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Stock-based
compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is recognized, on a straight-line basis, as the stock options are earned. The
Company believes that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the services received. The 
62  fair value of the stock options granted is calculated at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as prescribed by SFAS No123 using the following assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2001

100 70 70 The
stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of the common stock fluctuates. In connection with the grant of stock options to non-employees,
the Company recorded cumulative deferred stock-based compensation of $519,000, $942,000 and $336,000 as of December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 respectively, of which $98,000, $245,000, and
$101,000 has been amortized to expense in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
Warrants 
In connection with financing arrangements entered into by the Company in July1995 and October1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase 10,683
shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 65,000 shares of SeriesC convertible preferred stock at exercise prices of $234 and $100, respectively. Due to the automatic conversion of the
convertible preferred stock in connection with the Company initial public offering, the warrants for SeriesC convertible preferred stock became exercisable for
21,666 shares of common stock at $300 per share. The warrants expire on June30, 2002 and October14, 2004, respectively. The fair value of these warrants, determined using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model, was not material. 
Notes receivable 
In May1994, the Company loaned $69,009 to a stockholder/employee. The note bears interest at 643% per annum and is due May2003. In
August1996, the Company loaned an additional $200,000 to the same individual. The note was non-interest bearing, was originally due in 2001 and is collateralized by 166,666 shares
of common stock. This loan has been extended until December31, 2006 and now bears interest at 438% per annum. In July2000, the Company loaned the same individual an additional
$50,000. This loan bears interest at 662% per annum, is due in July2005 and is collateralized by the same 166,666 shares of common stock. At December31, 2001 and 2000, $364,627 and
$354,589 of principal and interest were outstanding under these notes, respectively. The Company has arranged with this stockholder/employee that the Company will receive a portion of the proceeds
from certain sales of his non-collateralized Company stock until his notes to the Company have been paid in full. In
January and December1998, the Company received two full recourse notes receivable from officers of the Company in exchange for common stock. The notes bear interest at 593%
and 451%, and are due in January and December2002, respectively. At December31, 2001, $149,444 and $61,388 of principal and interest were outstanding on these notes, respectively. At
December31, 2000, $141,079 and $58,739 of principal and interest were outstanding on these notes, respectively. The loans are collateralized by 450,666 and 90,000 shares of common stock,
respectively. The $149,444 note was repaid in full in January2002. 
63 
In
April2000, the Company received full recourse notes receivable from two officers of the Company in exchange for common stock. Each note bears interest at 671% and is due in
April2004. Each loan is collateralized by 90,000 shares of common stock. At December31, 2001 and 2000, $117,820 and $110,422 of principal and interest were outstanding on these notes,
respectively. 
NOTE 9ACQUISITION: 
In May2000, the Company acquired all the voting stock of Cerus Limited Cerus, now AeroGen Ireland Limited, in exchange for 1,725,000 shares of
SeriesE convertible preferred stock valued at $337 per share and transaction costs of approximately $150,000. Cerus was a development stage company engaged in the development of pulmonary
inhalation products utilizing the Company core aerosol generator technology, under a license agreement with the Company. 
The
acquisition of Cerus was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly the results of operations of Cerus were included in the Company financial statements
subsequent to May25, 2000. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition as determined by
management. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets was allocated to goodwill. The purchase price was allocated as follows: Cash and cash equivalents 542,174 Grants receivable 105,038 Property and equipment, net 34,772 Other assets 50,895 Assumed liabilities 287,908 Acquired workforce 100,000 Acquired in-process research and development 3,500,000 Goodwill 1,917,589 Total purchase price 5,962,560 Acquired
workforce and goodwill has been amortized over two and six years, respectively, on the straight-line basis. The acquired in-process research and
development represents the value of new medical and other technologies that were in various stages of development where no alternative future use was identified. Management is primarily responsible
for the valuation of the acquired in-process research and development. The fair value of the in-process research and development was based on the discounted cash flow method.
As Cerus was a development stage company, there were no historical pricing and margin assumptions to utilize and therefore estimates used were based on the expectations of management. Management did
not expect material net cash in-flows until at least 2005. The present value of these cash flows was calculated with an overall discount rate of 40%. At the date of acquisition, the
Company determined the technological feasibility of Cerus products was not established and, accordingly, wrote off the corresponding amounts to acquired in-process research and
development. Approximately $05million in research and development has been spent up to the date of the acquisition in an effort to develop the technologies to produce commercially viable
products. At the date of acquisition, the only identifiable intangible assets acquired were the technologies under development and the acquired workforce. Currently the Company knows of no
developments, which
would lead it to significantly change its original assessment of the expected timing and commercial viability of these projects.
