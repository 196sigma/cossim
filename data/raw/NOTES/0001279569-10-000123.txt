c
New accounting pronouncements Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standard Codification FASB ASC 815-10-50, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FASB ASC 815-10-50, requires enhanced disclosures about the Company derivative and hedging activities.The Company is required to provide enhanced disclosure
about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, iihow derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement 133 and iiihow derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity financial position and cash flows.The new disclosure was adopted January 1, 2009 as described in note 11. FASB ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events FASB ASC 855-10, establishes general standards for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet dates but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued.In particular, this statement sets forth:ithe period after the balance
sheet dates during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements,iithe circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet dates in its financial statements, andiii the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet dates.The new
disclosure was adopted June 30, 2009 as described in note 17. In January 2010 the FASB issued an exposure draft amending the guidance that SEC registrants would no longer be required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated.This guidance is expected to be finalized in 2010 and will be adopted by the Company when required. 42 VITRAN CORPORATION INC.

d
Foreign currency translation A majority of the Company shareholders, customers and industry analysts are located in the United States.Accordingly, the Company has adopted the United States dollar as its reporting currency. The United States dollar is the functional currency of the Company operations in the United States.The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Company Canadian operations. Each operation translates foreign currency-denominated transactions into its functional currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving rise to a gain or loss that is recognized in income during the current period. For reporting purposes, the Canadian operations are translated into United States dollars using the current rate method.Under this method, all assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate of exchange and all revenue and expense items are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.The
resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity.United States dollar debt of $710 million 2008 - $811 million is designated as a hedge of the investment in the United States dollar functional operation, such that related transaction gains and losses are recorded in the separate component of shareholders' equity. In respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the year-end rates.Revenue and expenses are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the transaction dates.All of the exchange gains or losses resulting
from these other transactions are recognized in income. 
e
Revenue recognition The Company LTL and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred.For the LTL segment, revenue for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period is recognized based on relative transit
time in each period with expenses recognized as incurred.Revenue for the SCO operation is recognized as the management services are provided. Within the LTL business unit, revenue adjustments are estimated at the end of each quarterly reporting period.These adjustments result from several factors, including weight and freight classification verifications, shipper bill of lading errors, pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments.The
revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in revenue from operations and accrued for as part of the allowance for doubtful accounts.Allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as a contra-account to accounts receivable. Historical experience, trends and current information are used to update and evaluate the estimate.As at December 31, 2009, revenue adjustments as a percentage of revenue was not material. 
f
Accounts receivable:
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $35million at December 31, 2009 2008 - $38 million. 43 VITRAN CORPORATION INC.

Inventory Inventory consists of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost and replacement cost. 
i
Property and equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost.Depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis from the date assets are put in service over their estimated useful lives as follows Buildings

j
Assets held for sale The Company has certain assets that are classified as assets held for sale.These assets are carried on the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value, less cost to sell.Once an asset is classified held for sale, there is no further depreciation taken on the asset.At
December 31, 2009, the net book value of assets held for sale was approximately $54 million.This amount is included in property and equipment on the balance sheet. 
k
Goodwill and intangible assets FASB ASC 350 requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, using fair value measurement techniques.The goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount
of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination.Determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgemental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.As at September 30, 2009, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded there was no impairment. 44 VITRAN CORPORATION INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1.
Significant accounting policies continued One of the indicators of impairment is a sustained decline in the Company share price whereby the market capitalization of the Company is less than its book value for an extended period of time.At December 31, 2008, before recording goodwill impairment charges, the carrying value of Vitran net assets were $1871 million
compared to the market capitalization of all of the Company outstanding shares which was $845 million.The market valuation of the Company declined during the fourth quarter as Vitran share price on the Nasdaq stock market decreased from $1347 at September 30, 2008 to $626 at December 31, 2008. These factors and the depressed macroeconomic environment indicated a triggering event had occurred requiring the Company, at a reporting unit level, to test for the impairment of goodwill at December
31, 2008.Using the income and market approach for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management concluded that the goodwill in its LTL segment was impaired and there was no impairment of goodwill in its other reporting units. At December 31, 2009, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require re-testing for impairment. FASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement.The
fair value used to value the Company goodwill is a Level 3.
Under FASB ASC 350 the determination of the amount of goodwill impairment requires comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The impairment analysis concluded that the LTL segment goodwill was impaired requiring a pre-tax non-cash charge of $1074 million
at December 31, 2008. Intangible assets consist of not-to-compete covenants and customer relationships and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives ranging from threeto eight years. During 2009 and 2008, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment. 
l
Income taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases.Significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the date of enactment.FASB
ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FASBASC740-10 requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process, whereby i the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and ii for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of
being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. 45 VITRAN CORPORATION INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 1.

m
Share-based compensation Under the Company stock option plan, options to purchase common shares of the Company may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of the Company by the Board of Directors or by the Company Compensation Committee.There are 906,700 options outstanding under the plan.The term of each option is 10years
and the vesting period is five years.The exercise price for options is the trading price of the common shares of the Company on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the day of the grant. Note9b provides supplemental disclosure for the Company stock options. 
n
Advertising costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.Advertising costs amounted to $376 in 2009 2008 - $462; 2007 - $784. 
o
Impairment of long-lived assets An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected from its use and disposal, and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value.A long-lived asset should be tested when events or circumstances
indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable.During 2009 and 2008, the Company has not identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment. 
p
Derivative instruments Derivative instruments are used to hedge the Company exposure to changes in interest rates.All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on their maturity.Changes in
the fair values of derivatives are recorded in income or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction.Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income in the period the hedged item affects income.If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified into income
at that time.Any ineffectiveness is recognized in income in the current period. 
q
Claims and insurance accruals Claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including amounts for claims incurred but not reported, for cargo loss and damage, bodily injury and property damage, workers' compensation, long-term disability and group health.In Canada and the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention
amounts per incident for auto liability, casualty and cargo claims.In the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for workers' compensation and employee medical.In establishing these accruals, management evaluates and monitors each claim individually, and uses factors such as historical experience, known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability. 46 VITRAN CORPORATION INC.

Deferred share units The Company maintains a deferred share unit DSU plan for all directors.Under this plan, all directors receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to Cdn. $2,50000.The Company records compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period initially
for Cdn. $2,50000 and subsequently based on changes in the market price of common shares. In addition to the directors' DSU plan, the Company adopted a DSU plan for senior executives.Under this plan, eligible senior executives receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to the senior executive entitlement.The entitlement amount varies based on
the senior executive position in the Company and the years of eligible service.The maximum entitlement amount varies between $2,50000 and $20,00000 per annum. The Company records compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period based on the market price of common shares. 
t
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the year.Significant estimates are used in determining, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred tax assets, claims and insurance accruals, share-based compensation, fair value measurements, intangible asset values and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests.Actual results could differ from those estimates. 47 VITRAN CORPORATION INC.

Acquisition Las Vegas/L.A. Express, Inc.
On November 30, 2007, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Las Vegas/L.A. Express, Inc. LVLA.The aggregate purchase consideration was approximately $845 million including transaction costs.This is comprised of $625 million in cash, $19 million in assumed debt and transaction
costs of approximately $03 million.Further, approximately $435 million of additional cash consideration is contingent on the vendors meeting certain future financial metrics.All additional contingent consideration paid to the vendors will be allocated to goodwill.The results of operations of LVLA are included in the consolidated results of the Company commencing December 1, 2007.The cash portion of the transaction was financed from proceeds from the Company
revolving credit facility.The total amount of goodwill, once determined, is not deductible for tax purposes.At December 31, 2008 and 2009, the operating results for LVLA exceeded the financial metrics required for the first and second contingent payments to the vendors.The Company recorded a $425 million adjustment to goodwill, of which $325 million was required in 2008 and subsequently paid in 2009 and $10 million was recorded as a liability in 2009.

Risk management activities The Company is exposed to market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business.The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
Interest rate swaps The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable rate debt.The Company has entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps on variable rate term debt and revolving debt to limit its exposure to changing interest rates and future cash flows for interest.The interest rate
swaps provide for the Company to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in return an amount equal to a variable rate of interest times the same notional amount.The swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges.The effective portions of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and are recognized into income in the same period in which the hedged forecasted transaction
affects income.Ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized into income as they occur.At December 31, 2009, the notional amount of the swaps was $288 million, with the average pay rate being 501% and the average receive rate being 026%.The swaps mature at various dates up to December 31, 2011. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-10, which provides a framework for measuring fair value under United States GAAP.As defined in FASB ASC 820-10, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date exit price.The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that the Company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable. 57 VITRAN CORPORATION INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued In thousands of United States dollars, except per share amounts where noted Years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 11.
Risk management activities continued The Company primarily applies the income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavours to utilize the best available information.Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.The Company is able to
classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs. FASB ASC 820-10-05 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurement.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following as of December 31, 2009   Liabilities
