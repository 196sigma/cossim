To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of ScanSoft, Inc   In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
ScanSoft, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND PRESENTATION
ScanSoft, Inc. was incorporated as Visioneer, Inc. in March 1992 and
through December 1998, developed and sold scanner hardware and software
products. On January 6, 1999, Visioneer sold the hardware business and the
Visioneer brand name to Primax Electronics, Ltd., and on March 2, 1999,
Visioneer acquired ScanSoft, in a cash election merger, from Xerox Corporation.
The corporate entity Visioneer survived the merger, but changed its name to
ScanSoft, Inc. In addition, Visioneer changed the ticker symbol for its common
stock that trades on the NASDAQ, to SSFT. On March 13, 2000, the Company
merged with Caere Corporation Caere, a California-based digital imaging
software company. The acquisitions of ScanSoft and Caere were accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of
operations of ScanSoft and Caere have been included in the Company financial
statements as of the acquisition dates.
When we refer to we or ScanSoft or the Company in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation ScanSoft, Inc., including
all of its consolidated subsidiaries.
Acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie L Speech Products N.V. Assets   On December 7, 2001, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase
agreement the Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and intellectual
property relating to the former L entities that were in bankruptcy under the
jurisdiction of both the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and
the Belgium Court of Ieper. We purchased these assets in a closed auction
proceeding administered by the creditors committee of the former entities and
approved by both the U.S. and Belgium courts on December 11, 2001. The
transaction was completed on December 12, 2001.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired patents,
trademarks, tradenames, product and customer contracts associated with certain
of the speech and language technology assets of L In addition, the Company
also obtained rights to accounts receivable related to the customer contracts
acquired and fixed assets. The Company also hired 223 employees from L The
Company paid $413 million in total consideration to the creditors as follows 100 million in cash, 74 million shares of the Company common stock valued
at $278 million based on the average of the closing share price of our stock 3
days before and after the proposed acquisition was announced and a 9%
promissory note in the principal amount of $35 million, to be repaid in
installments of $01 million of principal and interest quarterly commencing on
March 15, 2002, for a total of eleven 11 payments. All remaining principal and
interest shall become due on December 15, 2004.
With the acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie L assets in December 2001,
ScanSoft added speech and language solutions to its portfolio of
productivity-enhancing applications and technologies. The group of assets
acquired includes the RealSpeak text-to-speech technology, Dragon speech
recognition software and other speech and voice-related technologies aimed at
the rapidly growing telecommunications, automotive and mobile device markets.
ScanSoft believes that its speech-based technology and intellectual property is
widely considered the finest in the industry.
The Company generated $104 million of cash from operations for 2001 and
had a cash balance of $143 million at December 31, 2001. The Company cash
balance reflects lower operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions
and other cost reduction initiatives, taken in fiscal 2000, higher revenues
compared to fiscal 2000 and equity financings net of cash paid for the L
acquisition. The Company expects that operating expenses will increase in 2002
as a result of the L acquisition. While the Company believes its revenues will
also increase and therefore its cash flows from operations, cash generated from
operations could be negatively impacted if the Company products are not
accepted in the markets in which it does business, by seasonality of customer
buying patterns or by a continued or worsened economic downturn in the United
States or international markets where its products are sold. There can be no
assurance that the Company will
43
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
be able to continue to generate cash from operations or secure additional equity
financing if required. The Company has sustained recurring losses and has an
accumulated deficit at December 31, 2001. The Company believes that operating
expense levels in combination with expected future revenues will continue to
generate positive cash flows from operations. The Company also believes that,
should it experience any of the aforementioned factors, it has the ability to
reduce operating expenses to levels commensurate with revenues to maintain
positive cash flows from operations. The Company believes that cash flows from
future operations in addition to cash on hand will be sufficient to meet its
working capital, investing, financing and contractual obligations as they become
due for the foreseeable future including stock repurchase programs and potential
business or asset acquisitions.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentations
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
periods. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are
accounts receivable and sales allowances, the recoverability of intangible
assets including goodwill and the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in
foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated using the
average exchange rates for the period. Net unrealized gains and losses resulting
from foreign currency translation are included in other comprehensive loss,
which is a separate component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in results of operations. The Company
reported foreign currency transaction gains and losses of $02 million, $01
million and zero for the years ended 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
The Company derives revenues from the sale of its software products to
end-users through distribution partners and value added resellers VAR,
royalty revenues from OEM partners, license fees from sales of its products to
end-users and from services, primarily maintenance associated with software
license transactions.
The Company applies the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2 Software
Revenue Recognition, as amended by Statement of Position 98-9 Modification of
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions to
all transactions involving the sale of software products. In addition, the
Company applies the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue
Recognition.
For sales through distributors and authorized resellers including VAR,
title and risk-of-loss, pass to the customer upon shipment, at which time
payment is due. Agreements with distributors and resellers provide for full
rights of return. As a result, reserves for sales returns are established based
on inventory levels of the Company products at the distributors and resellers.
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of the Company product from distributors
and resellers to retailers or end-users of the product. Reserves for
44
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
estimated sales returns from retailers or end-users are recorded when the
revenue is recognized based on historical experience with sales returns from
these parties. From time to time, the Company offers its customers rebates, or
price protection incentive programs to retailers for the sale of the Company
products. The Company estimates the impact on revenue of rebate or price
protection programs based upon its historical experiences with similar programs
for like products. The estimated reserve for such rebates or programs is
recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period when the rebate or price
protection program is available to the end-user.
The Company also enters into royalty-bearing agreements with original
equipment manufacturers OEMs and performs software development services
pursuant to certain license agreements. The Company recognizes revenue for
royalty fees based on an accrual of the historical revenue trends for the
respective licensing agreements of the Company products by OEMs to third
parties. The Company considers the past payment and royalty reporting history of
its OEMs, seasonality of the OEMs business, the number of units sold in previous
periods and the overall economic climate that its OEMs operate in.
Revenue from the sale of licenses of the Company software products to
end-users is recognized upon delivery, provided that no significant obligations
remain, evidence of the arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable,
and collectibility is reasonably assured. For direct sales by its customer
service group, and for sales over the Internet, revenue is recognized when a
credit card authorization has been received and the product ships.
The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of maintenance and support to
end-users ratably over the contract period, usually one year. Payments received
in advance for maintenance and support revenue are originally treated as
deferred revenue.
The Company also generates revenue to a lesser degree from consulting and
training services. Fees charged for such services are based on a fee per day or
fee per student depending on the type of service or training provided.
For arrangements with multiple obligations for example, undelivered
maintenance and support, the Company allocates revenue to each element of the
arrangement based on the fair value of each element determined by the sales
price of the elements had they been sold separately.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid instruments with original
maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition. The Company invests
primarily in commercial paper.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined on a first-in,
first-out basis or market value. Costs incurred related to shipping and
handling of our inventory and products are recorded as a cost of revenue.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the term of the related lease or the useful
life, if shorter. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of sold or
retired assets are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in
operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets result from acquisitions that were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting and consist of the values of identifiable
intangible assets including core technology, patents, trade names, trademarks,
OEM relationships, work force and registered users base, as well as goodwill.
Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets exceeded the
fair values of those net assets on the purchase date. Intangible assets are
reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of three to
seven years. The Company evaluates its intangible assets when events and
circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Recoverability of these assets is
assessed based on undiscounted expected cash flows from these assets,
considering a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets and
economic projections, market trends and product development cycles. An
impairment in the carrying value of each asset is assessed when the undiscounted
expected cash flows derived from the asset are less than its carrying value see
Note 11.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and
enhancements to existing products, other than certain software development costs
that qualify for capitalization, are expensed as incurred. Software development
costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but
prior to the general release of the product, are capitalized and amortized to
cost of revenue over the estimated useful life of the related products. In the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, costs eligible for capitalization
were not material.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if,
based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company does not
provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries, which the Company considers to be permanent investments.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss, which
includes foreign currency translation adjustments. For the purposes of
comprehensive loss disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or
benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency translation adjustment, as
the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings in its
foreign subsidiaries.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, and trade
accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and does not require
collateral, since management does not anticipate nonperformance of payment. The
Company also maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have
been within management expectations. At December 31, 2001, three customers
represented 31%, 13% and 12%, of our net accounts receivable balance,
respectively. At December 31, 2000, two customers in aggregate accounted for
50%, of our net accounts receivable balance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Fair Value Disclosures of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
short-term bank borrowings and long-term notes payable and are carried in the
financial statements at amounts that approximate their fair value as of December
31, 2001 and 2000.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are classified as selling,
general and administrative costs. The Company reported advertising costs of $25
million, $19 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding excluding unvested restricted stock, and diluted loss per
share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and
dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Potential common shares result
from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants as well as
unvested shares of restricted stock and conversion of Series B Preferred Stock,
the proceeds of which are then assumed to have been used to repurchase
outstanding common stock using the treasury stock method. There is no difference
between basic and diluted net loss per share for all periods presented since
potential common shares were anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the
intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations. The Company follows the disclosure provisions of Statement of
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
see Note 6. Deferred compensation is recorded for restricted stock granted to
employees based on the fair value of the Company common stock at the date of
grant and is amortized over the period in which the restrictions lapse. All
stock-based awards to non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and related interpretations.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 SFAS 141, Business Combinations and
No. 142 SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting, and broadens the criteria for recording
intangible assets separate from goodwill. SFAS 142 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets,
including how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after
they have been initially recognized. In addition, SFAS 142 includes provisions
for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangible assets, such
as acquired workforce, into goodwill. SFAS 142 provides that goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but rather
be tested at least annually for impairment; intangible assets with finite useful
lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS 142 also
provides specific guidance for testing goodwill for impairment. In accordance
with its provisions, the Company will adopt SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002 and will
cease amortizing goodwill; the Company had previously been recording annual
goodwill amortization of approximately $101 million. The Company will also
reclassify approximately $01 million of previously recognized acquired
workforce to goodwill and as a result, amortization on this amount has also
ceased. The workforce recorded in connection with the L acquisition is not
subject to the provisions of SFAS 142 as the transaction, for financial
47
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
accounting purposes, was recorded as an asset purchase and not a business
combination. SFAS 142 also requires the Company to complete a transitional
goodwill impairment test with-in six months from the date of adoption. The
Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge on the $422
million of goodwill at December 31, 2001, upon completion of the initial
impairment review. The decrease in amortization expense from the goodwill will
be partly offset in 2002 by the amortization of intangible assets acquired from
L of approximately $45 million per year. The Company estimates total
amortization expense for 2002 will be approximately $219 million.
In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS
144. The objectives of SFAS 144 are to address significant issues relating to
the implementation of FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121, and
to develop a single accounting model, based on the framework established in SFAS
121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held
and used or newly acquired. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121; however, it retains
the fundamental provisions of SFAS 121 for 1 the recognition and measurement
of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and 2 the
measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS 144 supersedes
the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board No. 30,
Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring
Events and Transactions APB 30, for segments of a business to be disposed
of. However, SFAS 144 retains the requirement of APB 30 that entities report
discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that
reporting requirement to a component of an entity that either has been
disposed of or is classified as held for sale. SFAS 144 also amends the
guidance of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial
Statements, to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a temporarily
controlled subsidiary. SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, including interim periods, and,
generally, its provisions are to be applied prospectively. The Company does not
expect that the initial application of SFAS 144 will have a material impact on
its financial position or results of operations.
In November 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF, a committee of
the FASB, reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-9, Accounting for Consideration
Given by a Vendor to a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor Products EITF
01-9. EITF 01-9 presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or
reseller of the vendor products is a reduction of the selling prices of the
vendor products and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of
revenue when recognized in the vendor income statement and could lead to
negative revenue under certain circumstances. Revenue reduction is required
unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the
benefit fair value can be established, in which case such amounts may be
recorded as operating expenses. In accordance with its provisions, the Company
will adopt EITF 01-9 on January 1, 2002. Certain of its co-operative marketing
and marketing development fund programs do not meet the criteria to be recorded
as operating expenses, which is the current policy. Unless the Company is able
to renegotiate or otherwise change these marketing programs with its retailers,
amounts earned by the retailers under such programs will be recorded as revenue
reductions in the future. Upon adoption, the Company will reclassify all prior
period reported results of operations to conform to the presentation required by
EITF 01-9. The Company is currently assessing the impact of EITF 01-09 on its
previously reported revenue and operating expenses. EITF 01-9 will not impact
its overall results of operations.

5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock
The Company is authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, par value $0001 per share. The Company has designated 100,000 shares as
Series A Preferred Stock and 15,000,000 as Series B Preferred Stock. In
connection with the acquisition of ScanSoft see Note 11, the Company issued
3,562,238 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Xerox Corporation Xerox. The
Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock on a
one-for-one basis. The Series B Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of
$130 per share plus all declared but unpaid dividends. The Series B Preferred
Stock holders are entitled to non-cumulative dividends at the rate of $0065 per
annum per share, payable when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors. To
date no dividends have been declared by the Board of Directors. Holders of
Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except those rights provided
under Delaware law. The undesignated shares of preferred stock will have rights,
preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend
rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, as
shall be determined by the Board of Directors upon issuance of the preferred
stock. The Company has reserved 3,562,238 shares of its common stock for
issuance upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock.
Common Stock Warrants
In connection with the ScanSoft acquisition in 1999 see Note 11, the
Company issued Xerox a ten-year warrant that allows Xerox to acquire a number of
shares of common stock equal to the number of stock options whether vested or
unvested that remains unexercised at the expiration of any ScanSoft stock
option assumed by the Company in the merger. The exercise price for each warrant
share is $061. If all of the assumed ScanSoft options expire without being
exercised, Xerox would be entitled to purchase 1,736,630 shares of common stock.
From the date of acquisition through December 31, 2001, 520,413 ScanSoft options
50
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
have been forfeited and accordingly, the Xerox warrant at December 31, 2001 was
exercisable for the purchase of 520,413 shares of the Company common stock.
Stock Repurchase Program
During 2001, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2
million shares of common stock for a period of one year ending on August 22,
2002. Purchases have been and will be made in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions. Repurchased shares are available for issuance under
employee stock plans or in the ordinary course of business. For the year ended
December 31, 2001 the Company repurchased 656,000 shares of common stock at a
cost of $10 million.
Other
During December 2001, the Company issued 262,200 shares of its common stock
in partial settlement of a $21 million liability assumed in connection with the
Caere acquisition. The common stock was valued at $07 million based on the fair
value of the common stock on the date agreement was reached. The Company also
agreed to pay $07 million in cash as part of the settlement. The Company
realized a gain on this settlement of $07 million as a reduction of general and
administrative expenses in 2001.
On December 21, 2001, the Company committed to issuing 65,100 shares of its
common stock in partial settlement of a $10 million liability incurred as part
of the Caere acquisition. The common stock was valued at $03 million based on
the fair value of the common stock on the date agreement was reached. The
Company also agreed to pay $03 million in cash as part of the settlement. The
Company realized a gain on this settlement of $03 million as a reduction of
general and administrative expenses in 2001. The $03 million value of the
common stock is reflected in other long-term liabilities at year-end as the
shares were not issued as of December 31, 2001.
6. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS
Stock Option and Award Plans
The Company has several stock-based compensation plans under which
employees, officers, directors and consultants may be granted stock awards or
options to purchase the Company common stock generally at the fair market
value on the date of grant. Certain plans allow for options to be granted at
below fair market value under certain circumstances. Options become exercisable
over various periods, typically two to four years and have a maximum term of 10
years. At December 31, 2001, 17,409,583 shares were authorized for grant under
the Company stock-based compensation plans, of which 4,192,414 were available
for future grant. To date, all stock options have been granted with exercise
prices equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock on the date
of grant.
During 2001, the Company awarded 133,824 shares of restricted common stock
to senior executives at a weighted average fair value at the grant date of $272
resulting in deferred compensation of $291,000. Restrictions lapse over a period
of 2 to 4 years depending on the grant. The restricted stock awards entitle the
participant to full dividend and voting rights. Unvested shares are restricted
as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances.
Deferred compensation expense is amortized to compensation expense over the
period that the restrictions lapse. During 2001, compensation expense of $15,000
was recognized. No restricted stock awards were outstanding for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering
commencement date or 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering
termination date. The Company issued 95,952, 46,896 and 60,786 shares of common
stock under this plan during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999
respectively. The weighted average fair value of common stock on the grant date
was $071, $108 and $128 during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999 respectively.

using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
expected volatility of 130% for 2001 and 2000, and 209% for 1999, risk-free
interest rate of 366% to 497% for options granted in 2001, 502% to 668% for
options granted in 2000, and 536% to 607% for options granted in 1999, and a
weighted average expected option term of 5 years for all periods. The Company
has not paid dividends to date and assumed no dividend yield.
For the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the fair value of each purchase right
was estimated at the beginning of the offering period using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions used in 2001, 2000 and 1999:
expected volatility of 133% to 168% for 2001, 128% for 2000 and 100% to 130% for
1999; risk-free interest rate of 341% to 504%, 610% and 503% for 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively; and expected lives of six months for all three years.
The Company has not paid dividends and assumed no dividend yield. The

Litigation and Other Claims
Like many companies in the software industry, we have from time to time
been notified of claims that we may be infringing certain intellectual property
rights of others. These claims have been referred to counsel, and they are in
various stages of evaluation and negotiation. If it appears necessary or
desirable, we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. We can
give no assurance that licenses will be offered by all claimants, that the terms
of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us or that in all cases the
dispute will be resolved without litigation, which may be time consuming and
expensive, and may result in injunctive relief or the payment of damages by us.
In January 2002, ScanSoft received notice that the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and Electronics For Imaging, Inc. had filed a patent infringement
claim against 94 defendants including ScanSoft. Damages are sought in an
unspecified amount. To date, we have not yet been served with the court
documents. We cannot predict the outcome of the claim, nor can we make any
estimate of the amount of damages, if any, for which we will be held responsible
in the event of a negative conclusion of the claim.
On August 16, 2001, ScanSoft was sued by Horst Froessl for patent
infringement. Damages are sought in an unspecified amount. We filed an Answer
and Counterclaim on September 19, 2001. We believe this claim has no merit and
we intend to defend the action vigorously.
The Company believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a
significant adverse effect on the Company financial position and results of
operations, including the expenditure of a significant amount of resources
defending such claims. However, should the Company not prevail in any such
litigation, its operating results and financial position could be adversely
impacted.
8. 401k SAVINGS PLAN
The Company has established a retirement savings plan under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code the 401k Plan. The 401k Plan covers
substantially all employees of the Company who meet minimum age and service
requirements, and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual
compensation on a pre-tax basis. The Company contributes in cash, 100% of up to
the first 4% of an employee salary contributed to the 401k Plan by the
employee. The Company contributions to the 401k Plan totaled $04 million 04 million and $03 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

for the full amount of its net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of
realization of those assets as a result of the recurring and cumulative losses
from operations.
The Company monitors the realization of its deferred tax assets based on
changes in circumstances, for example, recurring periods of income for tax
purposes following historical periods of cumulative losses or changes in tax
laws or regulations. At such time that changes occur which will result in a
change in the estimate of the valuation allowance, an income tax benefit would
be recorded in the results of operations to reduce the valuation allowance.

11. ACQUISITIONS
Acquisition of Lernout & Hauspie L Speech Products N.V. Assets   On December 7, 2001, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase
agreement the Purchase Agreement to acquire certain assets and intellectual
property relating to the former L entities that were in bankruptcy under the
jurisdiction of both the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and
the Belgium Court of Ieper. We purchased these assets in a closed auction
proceeding administered by the creditors committee of the former entities and
approved by both the U.S. and Belgium courts on December 11, 2001. The
transaction was completed on December 12, 2001 and the Company results from
operations include L activities since that date.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired patents,
trademarks, tradenames, product and customer contracts associated with certain
of the speech and language technology assets of L In addition, the Company
obtained rights to accounts receivable related to the customer contracts
acquired and fixed assets. The Company also hired 223 employees from L The
Company paid $413 million in total consideration to the creditors as follows 100 million in cash, 74 million shares of the Company common stock valued
at $278 million based on the average of the closing share price of our stock 3
days before and after the proposed acquisition was announced and a 9%
promissory note in the principal amount of $35 million, to be repaid in
installments of $01 million of principal and interest quarterly commencing on
March 15, 2002, for a total of eleven 11 payments. All remaining principal and
interest shall become due on December 15, 2004. The Company incurred
approximately $10 million of acquisition related costs.
The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets
acquired patent and core technology, trade names and trademarks, and workforce
and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values. The total
identifiable tangible and intangible assets amounted to $229 million. The
excess purchase price of $213 million has been allocated to identifiable
long-lived assets based on their respective percentages of fair value. The
purchase price including acquisition costs was allocated as follows in
thousands                               
Identified intangible   $43,745
Net current liabilities    1,976
Fixed     531
$42,300
The values of the patents, core technology and trade names and trademarks
were determined using the income approach. The income approach requires a
projection of revenues and expenses specifically attributed to the intangible
assets. The discounted cash flow DCF method is then applied to the potential
income streams after making necessary adjustments with respect to such factors
as the wasting nature of the identifiable intangible assets and the allowance of
a fair return on the net tangible assets and other intangible assets employed.
There are several variations on the income approach, including the
relief-from-royalty method, the avoided cost method and the lost profits method.
The relief-from-royalty method was used to value the patents, core technology
and trade names and trademarks. The relief-from-royalty method is used to
estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of the intangible assets that
would otherwise have to pay royalties or licensee fees on revenues earned
through the use of the asset. The royalty rate used in the analysis is based on
an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for guideline intangible
assets.
Typically, revenue is projected over the expected remaining useful life of
the intangible asset. The market-derived royalty rate is then applied to
estimate the royalty savings. The key assumptions used in
57
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
valuing the patents and core technology are as follows: royalty rate 5 discount rate 15%, tax rate 40% and estimated life of 10 years. The key
assumptions used in valuing the trade names and trademarks are as follows:
observed royalty rate 1%, discount rate 15%, tax rate 40% and estimated life of
12 years.
The workforce value was determined using the avoided cost method. The
avoided cost method considers the concept of avoided cost as an indicator of
value. The avoided cost method is appropriate for estimating the fair value of
an asset where reliable data for sales of comparable assets are not available
and where assets do not directly produce a revenue stream. As a result, the
basis of the valuation is the estimated cost to recruit and train an entire new
workforce.
OEM contracts and customer relationships, as well as completed technology,
were determined to have de minimus values and, accordingly, no amount of the
purchase price was allocated to these intangible assets. A discounted cash flow
method was used to estimate the residual cash flows attributable to OEM
contracts and customer relationships. The projections included negative cash
flows over the early years of the relationship and, when combined with the
contributory asset charged for the other technology-based assets, such as
patents and core technology which are required to realize revenue under these
arrangements, resulted in de minimus value for the OEM contracts and the
customer relationships. The completed technology was valued using individual
cash flow projections for each technology, adjusted for capital charges, and
discounted to present value using a weighted average cost of capital. Cash flow
projections and operating profits are negative for the initial years and when
considered with the short life cycle of the application-based completed
technology, the value ascribable to the completed technology was de minimus.

In connection with the acquisition, we assumed certain liabilities for
products which were sold prior to the acquisition date and which are expected to
be upgraded with newer versions in 2002 and liabilities for development
contracts with customers. The actual amount of the liabilities may differ from
the estimated amounts. Differences between the actual and estimated amounts will
be recorded as an adjustment to the liability.
Caere Acquisition   On March 13, 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of Caere Corporation, a California-based company that designed, developed
and marketed a range of optical character recognition software tools, for
approximately $485 million in cash, 190 million shares of common stock of the
Company valued at $985 million, and the issuance of stock options for the
purchase of approximately 46 million shares of the Company common stock
valued at $155 million, in exchange for outstanding employee stock options of
Caere. The fair value of the employee stock options was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. In addition, pursuant to a concurrent
non-competition agreement and subject to certain other conditions, the Company
agreed to pay in cash the former Caere President and CEO on the second
anniversary of the merger, March 13, 2002, the difference between $1350 and the
closing price per share of ScanSoft common stock at that time, multiplied by
486,548. The value of this stock price guarantee at the date of acquisition was
approximately $41 million and has been included in the total purchase price of
the acquisition see Note 15. Additionally, in conjunction with the
acquisition, the Company incurred
58
SCANSOFT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
approximately $18 million of acquisition related costs. The purchase price of

$168,359
The amounts allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets,
including acquired in-process research and development, were based on the fair
value of the assets. Goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of
acquired net assets exceeded the fair values of those net assets on the date of
purchase. Acquired in-process research and development represented development
projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Accordingly, the amount of $183 million was charged to
operations upon consummation of the acquisition.
The values of the core technology, developed technology and acquired
in-process technology were determined by a risk adjusted, discounted cash flow
approach. The value of in-process research and development was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the in-process projects into commercially viable
products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the sale of such
products, discounting net cash flows back to their present values, and adjusting
those results to reflect the projects' stages of completion at the acquisition
date. These include projects primarily major version upgrades in each of
Caere major products, including OmniPage, OmniForm, and PageKeeper. The
discount rates used were 14% for developed technology, 19% for core technology,
and 24% for in-process technology. The discount rate for in-process technology
takes into consideration the Company weighted average cost of capital adjusted
for the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the
in-process research and development, the profitability levels of such technology
and the uncertainty of technological advances, which could potentially impact
the estimates described above.
The percentage of completion of the in-process projects ranged from 50% to
67% at the date of the acquisition. Revenues were initially projected to be
generated in late 2000 for each of the product versions in development at the
acquisition date. As of December 31, 2000, revenues from these projects were
expected to be generated beginning in the second quarter of 2001. All these
projects were completed during 2001.

Other identified intangible assets consist of a non-compete agreement,
acquired work force, a favorable building lease agreement, and patents on the
Caere technology. These assets have expected useful lives of 2, 3, 4 and 5
years, respectively, and are being amortized accordingly.
During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company, as a result of its
June restructuring see Note 12, wrote-off $11 million of acquired workforce
and $24 million of the favorable building lease established as part of the
identifiable intangible assets acquired from Caere. The portion of the assets
impaired related directly to the number of employees terminated and facility
space vacated in connection with these restructuring actions.
This acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Caere and the fair market
value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been included in the
financial statements of the Company as of the date of acquisition.
ScanSoft Acquisition   On March 2, 1999, the Company acquired the business of ScanSoft, Inc., an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Xerox Corporation, for approximately 68
million shares of common stock valued at $104 million, 36 million shares of
non-voting preferred stock valued at $46 million and the issuance of stock
options for the purchase of approximately 17 million shares of the Company
common stock, valued at $24 million, in exchange for outstanding employee stock
options of ScanSoft. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company incurred
approximately $12 million of acquisition related costs.
The purchase price of $186 million was allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired in-process research and development, core
technology, trade mark and trade name, and assembled workforce acquired and
liabilities assumed based on fair value. Acquired in-process research and
development represented development projects that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly, the

12. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
In connection with the acquisition of Caere in the first quarter of 2000,
ScanSoft identified 46 employees of Caere whose positions were eliminated upon
consummation of the acquisition. These positions included 22 in research and
development, 14 in general and administrative functions, and 10 in sales and
marketing. Additionally, the Caere president and CEO position was eliminated. As
a result, ScanSoft established as part of the purchase price allocation, a
restructuring reserve of $05 million for severance payments to employees, and a
restructuring reserve of $11 million for severance to the Caere former
president and CEO, the payments of which will continue through March 2005.
In June 2000, ScanSoft implemented a restructuring plan to strategically
refocus our business and bring operating expenses in line with net revenues. As
a result, the Company eliminated 65 employee positions including 29 in research
and development, 13 in general and administrative functions and 23 in support
and marketing. ScanSoft recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of
$1,069,000 for severance payments to these employees and a restructuring charge
of $04 million for certain termination fees to be incurred as a result of
exiting the Los Gatos facility. Additionally, ScanSoft wrote-off $35 million of
net intangible assets acquired as part of the Caere acquisition including the
acquired work force of $11 million and the favorable building lease of $24
million, which were impaired as a result of the restructuring action.
For the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, ScanSoft paid $08 million
and $11 million, respectively in severance payments related to these
restructuring actions. The remaining severance balance of $06 million primarily
relates to severance for the former Caere President and CEO and will be paid
through March 2005.
The Company was obligated to pay retention bonuses amounting to
approximately $08 million and $02 million relating to key employees who were
employed in the Caere integration and restructuring of the companies,
respectively. These retention bonuses were expensed as incurred and were not
included in the purchase price of the acquisition. As of December 31, 2000, the
Company had paid all of these bonuses.
During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company incurred an additional $03
million of facility related exit costs related to leasehold improvements on the
Los Gatos facility in space vacated by the Company.
