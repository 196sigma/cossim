NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Nature of Business We are an industry leader in the delivery of multi-screen video.
Our products and services facilitate the aggregation, licensing, management and distribution of video, television programming,
and advertising content to cable system operators, telecommunications companies and mobile communications providers. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are as follows Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consolidate the financial statements of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and all intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation. We also hold minority investments in the capital stock
of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance. We evaluate our
equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines
regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities VIEs should be applied in the financial statements.
Consolidation guidelines address consolidation by business enterprises of VIEs that possess certain characteristics. A VIE
is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We
use qualitative analysis to determine whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. We consider the rights and obligations
conveyed by the implicit and explicit variable interest in each VIE and the relationship of these with the variable interests held
by other parties to determine whether its variable interests will absorb a majority of a VIEs expected losses, receive a
majority of its expected residual returns, or both. If we determine that our variable interests will absorb a majority of the VIEs
expected losses, receive a majority of their expected residual returns, or both, we consolidate the VIE as the primary beneficiary,
and if not, it is not consolidated. We have reviewed our interest in
a partnership in Turkey and equity investment in Hightech ICT BV. The primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the
financial position and results of the VIE. We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest
entities during fiscal 2013. Accordingly, we used the equity method to account for these investments. In May 2012, we completed the sales of our Broadcast Servers
and Storage and Media Services businesses See Note 3. These consolidated financial statements reflect these businesses as discontinued
operations. We have retrospectively adjusted the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, cash flows
and stockholders equity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 and 2011 and the consolidated balance sheet for fiscal
2012. Besides for discontinued operations, we have reclassified other
certain prior fiscal year data to conform to our current fiscal year presentation.   59
Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates and
judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of inventory and accounts receivable, valuation of investments
and income taxes, stock-based compensation, goodwill, intangible assets and related amortization. Management bases these estimates
on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under
the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an
inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from managements estimates. Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities We account for investments in accordance with authoritative
guidance that defines investment classifications. We determine the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of money market
funds at January 31, 2013 and 2012, but can consist of corporate debt investments, asset-backed securities and government-sponsored
enterprises. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be
cash equivalents. All cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Our marketable securities are classified
as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders
equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts
to maturity are computed under the effective interest method and are included in interest income. Interest on securities is recorded
as earned and is also included in interest income. Any realized gains or losses would be shown in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in other income or expense. We evaluate our investments on a regular basis to determine
whether an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred. This evaluation consists of a review of several factors, including,
but not limited to: the length of time and extent that an investment has been in an unrealized loss position; the existence of
an event that would impair the issuer future earnings potential; and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a period
of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Declines in value below cost for investments where it is
considered probable that all contractual terms of the investment will be satisfied, is due primarily to changes in interest rates,
and where the company has the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery,
are not assumed to be other-than-temporary. Any other-than-temporary declines in fair value are recorded in earnings and a new
cost basis for the investment is established. Fair Value Measurements Definition and Hierarchy The applicable accounting guidance
defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or
most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about the fair value measurements
of assets and liabilities. This guidance requires us to classify and disclose assets and liabilities measured at fair value on
a recurring basis, as well as fair value measurements of assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis in periods subsequent
to initial measurement, in a fair value hierarchy.   60
The fair value hierarchy is broken
down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where
available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required, as well as the assets and liabilities that we value using
those levels of inputs Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Assets
utilizing Level 1 inputs include money market funds and U.S. government securities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
prices in markets that are not very active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We primarily use broker quotes for valuation of our short-term investments.
We did not have any Level 2 assets or liabilities at January 31, 2013 or January 31, 2012. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair
value of the assets or liabilities. The fair value measurements of the contingent consideration obligations related to the acquisitions
of Flashlight, VividLogic and eventIS are valued using Level 3 inputs. Valuation Techniques We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
value based on valuation techniques using the best information available, which may include quoted market prices, market comparables
and discounted cash flow projections. Financial instruments include money market funds, corporate debt investments, asset-backed
securities, government-sponsored enterprises and state municipal obligations. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that
are observable either directly or indirectly. In periods of market inactivity, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced
for certain instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to
Level 3. Based on additional information, we made a revision to reclassify $56 million of investments from Level 2 to Level 1
as of January 31, 2012. Management believes that the revision is not significant to the financial statements. Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers Financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations
of credit risk include cash equivalents, investments in treasury bills, certificates of deposits and commercial paper, trade accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We restrict our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities
to repurchase agreements with major banks and U.S. government and corporate securities which are subject to minimal credit and
market risk. For trade accounts receivable, we evaluate customers
financial condition, require advance payments from certain of our customers and maintain reserves for potential credit losses.
We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally do not require collateral. For some
international customers, we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted.
We monitor payments from customers and assess any collection issues. We maintain allowances for specific doubtful accounts and
other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to
make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses. We base our allowances for
doubtful accounts on historical collections and write-off experience, current trends, credit assessments, and other analysis of
specific customer situations. At January 31, 2013 and 2012, we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $08 million and $10
million, respectively, to provide for potential credit losses. At January 31, 2013, two separate customers accounted for 19% and
11%, respectively, of our gross accounts receivable balance and one customer accounted for 20% of our January 31, 2012 balance.
For fiscal 2013 and 2012, two customers each accounted for more than 10%, and collectively accounted for 30% and 35%, respectively,
of our total revenues.   61
Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventories consist primarily of components
and subassemblies and finished products held for sale. The values of inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine that the carrying
value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We record charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value
when impairment is identified through a quarterly review process. The obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates
about future demand, or possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments. For the years ended January 31, 2013, 2012
and 2011, we recorded $21 million, $10 million and $30 million in inventory write-downs, respectively, of which $18 million
was booked to cost of sales in fiscal 2013 and $04 million and $25 million were booked to restructuring expense in fiscal 2012
and fiscal 2011, respectively. Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of land and buildings, office
and computer equipment, leasehold improvements, demonstration equipment, deployed assets and spare components and assemblies used
to service our installed base. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Determining
the useful lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results.
If our estimates require adjustment, it could have a material impact on our reported results. Demonstration equipment consists of systems manufactured by
us for use in marketing and selling activities. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful
lives or the term of the respective leases using the straight-line method. Deployed assets consist of movie systems owned and manufactured
by us that are installed in a hotel environment. Deployed assets are depreciated over the life of the related service agreements.
Capitalized service and spare components are depreciated over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Maintenance
and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of the assets disposed of, and the related accumulated
depreciation, are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of net income or loss. Equity Investments Our investments in affiliates include investments accounted
for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting. The investments that represent less than a 20% ownership interest
of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost. Under the equity method of accounting, which generally applies to investments
that represent 20% to 50% ownership of the common shares of the affiliate, our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or
losses of the affiliate are included in equity income in earnings of affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income loss. We periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments
in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, may suggest an other
than temporary decline in the value of the investment. The carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected
by the affiliates ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans, general market conditions, industry
considerations specific to the affiliates business, and other factors. The inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding
or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by
those events. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses
or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investments
current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. We record an impairment charge when we believe
an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.   62
Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets In connection with acquisitions of operating entities, we recognize
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is
evaluated for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually in our third quarter beginning August 1. Goodwill of a reporting
unit may be tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances
change such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, decline in the Companys stock price, or material adverse changes
in the business climate, which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
The process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value
of the reporting units, including the method used to determine fair value, discount rates, expected levels of cash flows, revenues
and earnings, and the selection of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions. We may employ three generally
accepted approaches for valuing businesses: the market approach, the income approach and the asset-based cost approach to arrive
at the fair value. In calculating the fair value, we derived the standalone projected five year cash flows for the Company. This
process starts with the projected cash flows which were discounted. The choice of which approach and methods to use in a particular
situation depends on the facts and circumstances. We account for business acquisitions in accordance with authoritative
guidance which determines and records the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities, contractual contingencies and contingent
consideration assumed as of the dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant
estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and estimated contingent consideration
payments. In-process research and development IPRD
assets as of the acquisition date are recorded as indefinite-lived intangible assets and are subject to impairment testing at least
annually. The useful life of the intangible asset recognized will be reconsidered if and when an IPRD project is completed
or abandoned. We also evaluate property and equipment, intangible assets and
other long-lived assets on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internal and external that may suggest
an asset is not recoverable. If such circumstances exist, we evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to determine if impairment
exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compares that value
to the carrying value of the assets. Our cash flow estimates contain managements best estimates, using appropriate and customary
assumptions and projections at the time. Intangible assets consist of customer contracts, completed technology,
non-competition agreements, patents and trademarks. IPRD assets are included in other intangible assets at January 31, 2013
and 2012. The intangible assets are amortized to cost of sales and operating expenses, as appropriate, on a straight-line or accelerated
basis in order to reflect the period that the assets will be consumed. We develop software for resale in markets that are subject to
rapid technological change, new product development and changing customer needs. The time period during which software development
costs can be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very
short, and consequently, the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to our financial position or results of operations.
Software development costs relating to sales of software requiring significant modification or customization are charged to costs
of product revenues. Amortization expense is recorded over the period of economic
consumption or the life of the agreement, whichever results in the higher expense, starting with the first shipment of the product
to a customer. Amortization expense charged to cost of sales was $24 million, $25 million and $20 million for fiscal 2013, 2012
and 2011, respectively.   63
Income Taxes As part of the process of preparing our financial statements,
we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves
estimating our actual current tax exposure, including assessing the risks associated with tax audits, together with assessing temporary
differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheet. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective income tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the weight of all
available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will
not be realized. We will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future
is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence. Significant management judgment is required in determining
our income tax provision, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax
assets. We have established a 100% valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not
be fully realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events, including
generating sufficient pre-tax income in future periods. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, our provision
for income taxes could be materially impacted. We do not provide for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings
of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested in the operations outside the United States. Authoritative guidance as it relates to income tax liabilities
states that the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements is more
likely than not i.e., a likelihood of occurrence greater than 50%. The recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes
that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant
taxing authority. Those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in
which they meet the more likely than not standard, or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority,
or upon expiration of the statute of limitations. Derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an
entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained. We file annual income tax returns in
multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally
resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax
position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves as well as the
related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary,
the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are
no longer necessary. The changes in estimate could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results. In addition,
settlement of any particular position could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position. Restructuring We record restructuring charges consisting of employee severance
and the disposal of fixed assets. Restructuring charges represent our best estimate of the associated liability at the date the
charges are recognized. Adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period
they become known. Differences between actual and expected charges and changes in assumptions could have a material effect on our
restructuring accrual as well as our consolidated results of operations.   64
Foreign Currency Translation For subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar is designated as the
functional currency of the entity, we translate that entitys monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies
into U.S. dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates, as of each balance sheet date. Non-monetary
assets e.g., inventories, property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement accounts e.g., cost
of sales, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between the functional currency
the U.S. dollar and the local currency. Revenue and other expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the
fiscal period. Translation adjustments and transactions gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, and any unrealized gains
and losses on short-term inter-company transactions are included in other income or expense, net. For subsidiaries where the local currency is designated as the
functional currency, we translate our assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars the reporting currency at current exchange rates
as of each balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Cumulative
translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity. Exchange gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short-term inter-company transactions are included in other income or
expense, net. The aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses included as
other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss were approximately $23,000, $02
million and $12 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Comprehensive Loss Income We present accumulated other comprehensive loss and total comprehensive
loss income in the consolidated statement of operations. At the end of fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, our total comprehensive loss
income of $94 million, $50 million and $284 million consists primarily of net loss, cumulative translation adjustments and
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of income tax. Revenue Recognition Our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware, software,
systems and services in multiple-element arrangements. Revenues from sales of hardware, software and systems that do not require
significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer there is evidence of an arrangement fees are fixed or determinable; and collection of the related receivable is considered probable. Customers are billed for installation, training, project management
and at least one year of product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale. Revenue from these activities
is deferred at the time of the product sale and recognized ratably over the period these services are performed. Revenue from ongoing
product maintenance and technical support agreements is recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements. Revenue from
software development contracts that include significant modification or customization, including software product enhancements,
is recognized based on the percentage of completion contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates
of total labor efforts to complete the contract. Accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in
contract accounting when executed. Revenue from shipping and handling costs and other out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed by customers
are included in revenues and cost of revenues. Our share of intercompany profits associated with sales and services provided to
affiliated companies are eliminated in consolidation in proportion to our equity ownership.   65
We have historically applied the software revenue recognition
rules as prescribed by ASC985-605. In October2009, the FASBissued ASU2009-14, Certain Revenue
Arrangements That Include Software Elements, which amended ASC 985-605. This ASU removes tangible products containing
software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from
the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. In the case of our hardware products with embedded software, we have determined
that the hardware and software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality, and therefore,
the revenue from the sale of these products no longer falls within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. Revenue
from the sale of software-only products remains within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. Maintenance and support,
training, consulting, and installation services no longer fall within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules, except
when they are sold with and relate to a software-only product. Revenue recognition for products that no longer fall under the scope
of the software revenue recognition rules are similar to that for other tangible products and ASU 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable
Revenue Arrangements, which amended ASC 605 and was also issued in October2009, which is applicable for multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements. ASU 2009-13 allows companies to allocate revenue in a multiple-deliverable arrangement in a manner that better
reflects the transactions economics. ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in our fiscal year 2012 and thereafter. Under the software revenue recognition rules, the fee is allocated
to the various elements based on VSOE of fair value. Under this method, the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered
elements, based on their fair values, with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements. Where fair value of undelivered
service elements has not been established, the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services
are performed. The amounts allocated to undelivered elements, which may include project management, training, installation, maintenance
and technical support and certain hardware and software components, are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold
separately and unaccompanied by the other elements. The amount allocated to installation, training and project management revenue
is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time to complete the service. These services are not essential to
the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipments capabilities, are available from other vendors
and the systems are standard products. For multiple-element arrangements that include software development with significant modification
or customization and systems sales where VSOE of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement
other than maintenance and technical support, percentage of completion accounting is applied for revenue recognition purposes
to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support. All multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements
negotiated prior to February 1, 2011 and the sale of all software-only products and associated services have been accounted for
under this guidance. Under the revenue recognition rules for tangible products as
amended by ASU 2009-13, the fee from a multiple-deliverable arrangement is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their
relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit
of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as
a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those
combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon VSOE if available,
TPEif VSOE is not available, and BESPif neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of the Companys,
or any competitors, largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. BESP
is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions
and entity-specific factors. All multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements negotiated after February1, 2011, excluding the
sale of all software-only products and associated services, have been accounted for under this guidance. The selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation
method for certain of our services are based upon VSOE. The selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation method
for third-party products from other vendors are based upon TPE. The selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation
method for our hardware products, software, subscriptions, and customized services for which VSOE does not exist are based upon
BESP. We do not believe TPE exists for these products and services because they are differentiated from competing products and
services in terms of functionality and performance and there are no competing products or services that are largely interchangeable.
Management establishes BESP with consideration for market conditions, such as the impact of competition and geographic considerations,
and entity-specific factors, such as the cost of the product, discounts provided and profit objectives. Management believes that
BESP is reflective of reasonable pricing of that deliverable as if priced on a stand-alone basis.   66
Since all of our revenue prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-14
fell within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules and we have only established VSOE for services and revenue in a
multiple-deliverable arrangement involving products, revenue was frequently deferred until the last item was delivered. The adoption
of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 has resulted in earlier revenue recognition in multiple-deliverable arrangements involving our hardware
products with embedded software because revenue can be recognized for each of these deliverables based upon their relative selling
prices as defined above. Service revenue from content processing provided to our customers
is recognized when services are provided, based on contracted rates. Upfront fees received for services are recognized ratably
over the period earned, whichever is the longer of the contract term or the estimated customer relationship. Any taxes assessed by a governmental authority to revenue-producing
transactions e.g. sales or value-added taxes are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues. Stock-Based Compensation We account for all employee and non-employee director stock-based
compensation awards using the authoritative guidance regarding stock-based payments. We have continued to use the Black-Scholes
pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards. We also use the
Monte Carlo pricing model for our market-based option awards. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the
fair value of stock-based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the
stock-based payment awards and stock price volatility. Management estimated the volatility based on the historical volatility of
our stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent managements best estimates,
but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. As a result, if circumstances
change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition,
we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual
forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different
from what it has recorded in the current period. The estimated fair value of our stock-based options and performance-based RSUs,
less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis, whereas the RSUs and employee
stock purchase plan stock units are amortized on a straight-line basis. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. Advertising
costs were $02 million, $04 million and $03 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share are presented in accordance with authoritative
guidance which requires the presentation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted-average shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the denominator includes both
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and the weighted average number of potential
common stock, such as stock options, employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock, calculated using the treasury stock method. For fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 respectively 1,649,210, 1,566,726
and 2,459,389 of common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options are anti-dilutive and have been excluded from the diluted
earnings per share computation as the exercise prices of these common shares were above the market price of the common stock for
the periods indicated. For fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, an additional 495,185 and 1,004,158 stock awards, respectively, have been
excluded from diluted earnings per share due to the net loss. Below is a summary of the shares used in calculating basic and diluted
earnings per share for the periods indicated   67

31,985,802 Recent Accounting Standard Updates Impact of Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Goodwill Impairment Test In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles
Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which provided additional guidance on the annual and interim
goodwill impairment testing. The guidance became effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2013. This guidance provides
entities with an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value
of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test will be required.
The adoption of this update had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. See Note 8, Goodwill
and Intangible Assets, for further information on the Companys annual impairment tests. Fair Value Measurements In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value
Measurement Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS,
which amended previous guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value. The guidance became effective for us at
the beginning of fiscal 2013. The update amends the application of the highest and best use concept to be used only
in the measurement of the fair value of nonfinancial assets, clarifies that the measurement of the fair value of equity-classified
financial instruments should be performed from the perspective of a market participant who holds the instrument as an asset, clarifies
that an entity that manages a group of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of its net risk exposure to those risks can
measure those financial instruments on the basis of its net exposure to those risks, and clarifies when premiums and discounts
should be taken into account when measuring fair value. This guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common
requirements for the measurement of and disclosure about fair value between International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS
and U.S. GAAP. The guidance also changes some fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements related to
activities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Besides a change in disclosure requirements, the adoption of this update had
no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive
Income: Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, with the objective of improving
the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. This update requires the effect of significant
reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income be shown by component. Significant reclassifications should be
shown by the respective line items of net income only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income under
U.S. GAAP. If the reclassification to net income is not required under U.S. GAAP, an entity is required to cross-reference to other
disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. This update is effective prospectively for our fiscal 2014 and
early adoption is permitted. Besides changes to disclosures, we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant
impact on our consolidated financial statements.   68
Balance Sheet Offsetting In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Balance
Sheet Topic 220-Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, which amends previous
guidance on the disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to clarify that the scope of this guidance
applies to derivatives including bifurcated embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and
securities borrowing and lending transactions that are offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar
agreement. The guidance becomes effective at the beginning of our fiscal 2014 and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative
periods. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, Intangibles
Goodwill and Other: Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment, which amends previous guidance
on the annual and interim testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The guidance becomes effective at the beginning
of our 2014 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. The update provides entities with the option of first assessing
qualitative factors to determine whether it is more than likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible
asset is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived
intangible asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test would still be required.
We perform annual impairment tests as of August 1st of each fiscal year. The adoption of this update is not expected
to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3. Discontinued Operations On May 4, 2012, we completed the sale of our Broadcast Servers
and Storage business and received a cash payment, net of certain adjustments, of $49 million and recorded a total gain in this
transaction, net of tax in the amount of $15 million. The financial results from this divested business are included in discontinued
operations in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss. On May 21, 2012, we completed the sale of our
Media Services business, ODG, to Avail Media, Inc. Avail for a purchase price
of approximately $27 million plus certain working capital adjustments. We received an initial cash payment of $218 million in
May 2012, and as part of the purchase agreement, $57 million in cash was held in escrow by an escrow agent, of which $40 million
was tied to a specific indemnity matter and $17 million was related to a general indemnity provision. Avail also held another
$10 million for the payment of certain intercompany indebtedness between ODG and SeaChange as part of the transaction. As part
of the agreement with Avail, we were also potentially required to pay Avail $15 million which we included in other liabilities,
long-term on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of the acquisition. We recorded a $160 million loss in our consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income loss from the sale of ODG in the first half of fiscal 2013, primarily related
to goodwill impairment. We also incurred investment advisor fees of approximately $10 million as well as legal fees that approximated
$05 million related to the sale of ODG, which were expensed as incurred. On November 26, 2012, we signed the first amendment to the ODG
purchase agreement that resulted in the release to us of the general escrow of $17 million, which we received on November 30, 2012 a $03 million reduction of the $10 million intercompany indebtedness due from Avail; and a reduction in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the $15 million obligation.   69
On January 31, 2013, we signed the third
amendment to the ODG purchase agreement that resulted in the release of $20 million of the amount held in escrow for the specific indemnification matter which we received on February
4, 2013; and the release to us from the escrow for the specific indemnification matter in the amount of $08 million on May 1, 2013 and
June 1, 2013, with the remaining $04 million to be received on July 1, 2013. The aforementioned amendments resulted in a net decrease in
the loss on sale of ODG of approximately $05 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Lastly, the financial results
from the sale of Media Services business included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $170 million that we recorded in the
first quarter of fiscal 2013. The financial results from the Media Services segment are included as discontinued operations in
our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss. The following table details selected financial information for

$5,656 Available-for-Sale Securities We rely on mark to market valuations to record the fair value
of our available for sale security assets which are measured under a Level 1 input. These assets are publicly-traded equity securities
for which market prices are readily observable and recorded. At January 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $61 million and $79 million,
respectively, in short-term marketable securities and $72 million and $41 million, respectively, in long-term marketable securities. We determine the appropriate classification of debt securities
at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date. Our investment portfolio consists of money
market funds, corporate debt investments, asset-backed securities, government-sponsored enterprises, and state and municipal obligations.
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.
All cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale
and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders equity as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity are computed
under the effective interest method and is included in interest income. Interest on securities is recorded as earned and is also
included in interest income. Any realized gains or losses would be shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive income loss in other expense, net.   73
The following is a summary of available-for-sale securities,
including the cost basis, aggregate fair value and gross unrealized gains and losses, for cash equivalents, short-and long-term

were sold for total proceeds of $0, $0, and $05 million, respectively. The gross realized gains and losses for fiscal years 2013,
2012 and 2011 were immaterial. For purposes of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based

$13,273 We concluded that there were no other than temporary declines
in investments recorded as of January 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. The unrealized holding losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale
securities in the amount of approximately $6,000, $01 million and $01 million for the years ended January 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively, have been included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid
investments in money market mutual funds, government sponsored enterprise obligations, treasury bills, commercial paper and other
money market securities with remaining maturities at date of purchase of 90 days or less. The fair value of cash including restricted
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at January31, 2013 and 2012 was $1209 million and $938 million, respectively,
and approximated fair value.   74
Restricted Cash Pursuant to certain lease agreements, share purchase agreements
and agreements with financial institutions, we are required to maintain cash reserves, classified as restricted cash. Current restricted
cash totaled $09 million and $12 million at January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition-Related Consideration We determined the fair value of the acquisition-related consideration
in connection with the acquisition of eventIS in September 2009 using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. This fair
value measurement is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Any change
in the fair value of the acquisition-related consideration for the deferred fixed purchase price and earn-out payments subsequent
to the acquisition date, including changes from events after the acquisition date, such as changes in our estimate of the performance
goals, will be recognized in earnings in the period the estimated fair value changes. The fair value of the acquisition-related
consideration to be distributed directly to the eventIS, VividLogic and Flashlight selling shareholders is $57 million as of January
31, 2013. 5. Consolidated Balance Sheet Detail Inventory consists primarily of hardware and related component

an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the investment. There were no indications of other than temporary declines
in the fair value of investments in affiliates as of January 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our investments in affiliates under

preferred stock of Visible World and we account for this investment under the cost method of accounting. For fiscal years 2012
and 2011, we recognized revenues of approximately $11,000 and $05 million respectively, from Visible World. We did not recognize
any revenue from Visible World in fiscal 2013. Casa Systems, Inc. On April 26, 2010, we sold our entire
equity investment in Casa Systems, Inc., a Massachusetts based company that specializes in VOD products for the telecommunications
and television markets, for $341 million realizing a pre-tax profit of $252 million, which is recorded in gain on sale of investment
in affiliates on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal 2011. InSite One. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we
sold our entire equity investment in InSite One for $46 million in cash realizing a pre-tax profit of $19 million, which is recorded
in gain on sale of investment in affiliates on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal
2011. In fiscal 2013, we recorded an additional $09 million gain on sale of Insite One, as we received additional funds that were
previously held in escrow by the buyers of Insite One. 7. Acquisitions Flashlight Engineering and Consulting, LLC On June 19, 2012, we completed the acquisition of all the assets
and intellectual property, including customer contracts and non-compete agreements, from Flashlight for $03 million in cash. As
a result of achieving certain of the performance metrics during fiscal 2013, an earn-out of $02 million was achieved and accrued
in fiscal 2013. We anticipate making this payment in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. eventIS Group B.V. On September1, 2009, we acquired the entire share capital
of eventIS which is based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and provides VOD and linear broadcast software
and related services to cable television and telecommunications companies primarily in Europe. The results of eventISs
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. We
acquired eventIS to expand our VOD solutions into the European market. Fair Value of Consideration Transferred Under the terms of the definitive agreement with eventIS, we
paid $366 million upon the closing of the transaction on September 1, 2009. In addition, we were obligated to pay 12 million
approximately $16 million in cash to the former eventIS shareholders on each of the first three anniversary dates following
the acquisition. We were also obligated on each of the aforementioned anniversary dates to issue shares of restricted stock equating
to 08 million approximately $11 million annually to the former eventIS shareholders. The purchase price also included
a performance-based component principally related to the achievement of certain annual revenue targets for eventIS and SeaChange
products and services. The revenue performance metrics cover the three year period ending January 31, 2013 with payment upon achievement
of these metrics occurring annually. We have made cash payments to date to the holding company of approximately $44 million and
issued approximately 304,000 restricted common shares. On September 1, 2012, we amended the eventIS share purchase agreement with
the holding company and as a result, we will accelerate approximately 102,000 restricted shares on September 1, 2013. The amendment
did not change the total amount of payments payable under the purchase agreement. We estimate earn-out payments will be made in
the first half of fiscal 2014 for amounts earned based on the respective earn-out criteria.   77
VividLogic, Inc. On February1, 2010, we completed
our acquisition of VividLogic, Inc. VividLogic. VividLogic, based in Fremont, California provides in-home infrastructure
software for high definition televisions, in-home gateway, and set-top boxes to cable television service providers, set-top box
manufacturers and consumer electronics CE suppliers. We acquired VividLogic to
expand our in-home solutions. The results of VividLogics operations have been included in the consolidated financial
statements since the acquisition date. Fair Value of Consideration Transferred As of January 31, 2013, we have made cash payments totaling
approximately $26 million to the former shareholders of VividLogic. Under the share purchase agreement with the former shareholders
of VividLogic, we were obligated to make a fixed payment of $10 million on February 1, 2013 which was paid on February 4, 2013.
Additional earn-out payments in the amount of $20 million were earned for the year ending January 31, 2013 based on qualifying
product revenue. We have recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2013 for this earn out payment,
which we expect to pay in the first half of fiscal 2014. 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets At January 31, 2013 and 2012, we had goodwill of $451 million
and $444 million, respectively. The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended January 31, 2013 and 2012 are

$45,103 The goodwill balance excludes $06 million of goodwill assigned,
based on a relative fair value calculation, to the divestiture of the Broadcast Servers and Storage business unit and is included
in non-current assets related to discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill annually on
August 1st and have determined that the fair value of our goodwill balance exceeded its carrying value. Accordingly,
since no impairment indicator existed as of August 1, 2012 and the fair value of the goodwill exceeded the carrying value, we determined
that goodwill was appropriately stated as of August 1, 2012 and no impairment charge was necessary. For more information on the
goodwill impairment test see MDA Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates,
located in Part II, Item 7., of this Form 10-K. At January 31, 2013 and 2012, the balances in net intangible
assets of $175 million and $224 million, respectively, consist of patents, customer contracts, non-compete agreements, completed
technology and trademarks.   78

9. Severance and Other Restructuring Costs During fiscal 2013, we continued to take actions to lower our
cost structure as we strive to improve our financial performance and incurred restructuring charges totaling $31 million. These
charges included severance costs of $19 million and other restructuring costs of $12 million. Severance costs were primarily
a result of a reduction of the finance and manufacturing departments and the termination of two senior executives during fiscal
2013. The other restructuring costs included 08 million for the write off of leasehold improvements for the reduction of space and certain fixed assets in our leased
facility in the Philippines 02 million for a sign-on bonus, relocation expenses and recruitment fees relating to the hiring and appointment of a permanent
Chief Executive Officer on May 1, 2012; and 02 million reduction in the carrying value of our facility in New Hampshire in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. With the divestiture of our Broadcast Servers and Storage business,
we determined we would no longer utilize our facility in New Hampshire as an active operation and have placed the building on the
market for sale. We originally placed it on the market for $07 million. To be more competitive in the real estate market in which
the property is located, we reduced the selling price to $05 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2012, we incurred restructuring charges totaling
$36 million including severance costs of $25 million for the termination of 33 employees, including the departure of the President
and the retirement of the Chief Executive Officer and a $11 million restructuring charge for the disposal of fixed assets relating
to the New Hampshire facility discussed above. The following table shows the change in balances of our severance
liability for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013. These amounts are reported as a component of accrued liabilities on the consolidated

5,805,804 the 804 patent, a patent in which ARRIS has an ownership interest. On August 3, 2009, SeaChange
filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment from the Court that its products do not infringe the 804 patent and asserting
certain equitable defenses. On June 4, 2010, the Court entered an Order staying the declaratory judgment action pending resolution
of the contempt proceeding. On September 2, 2011, the Court entered an Order in which it concluded that a contempt proceeding was
the appropriate procedure for resolving the parties dispute and that further factual and legal determinations would be necessary.
On March 1, 2012, the Court conducted a hearing on the contempt motion at which the parties submitted additional information. On
October 9, 2012, the Court rejected ARRIS contempt allegations, concluding that the record did not contain clear and convincing
evidence to support a contempt finding that SeaChanges modified ITV system infringes the ARRIS patent. The Court denied
ARRIS motion of contempt. ARRIS filed a Notice of Appeal on November 8, 2012. ARRIS and SeaChange have submitted their briefs to
the Court of Appeals for the Federal circuit, though no date has been set yet for oral argument. The District Court has continued
the stay of SeaChange case seeking a declaratory judgment pending resolution of ARRIS appeal.   80
Revolving Line of Credit/Demand Note Payable Our $200 million revolving line of credit with RBS Citizens
expired on October 31, 2012. On November 28, 2012, we entered into a letter agreement with JP Morgan for a demand discretionary
line of credit and a Demand Promissory Note in the aggregate amount of $200 million the Line of Credit. Borrowings
under the Line of Credit will be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. The Line of Credit expires
on November 27, 2013. We currently do not have any borrowings nor do we have any financial covenants under this line. We are occasionally required to post customer performance bonds,
issued by a financial institution, to secure certain sales contracts. Customer performance bonds generally authorize the financial
institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure to satisfy an obligation.
The customer performance bonds are generally posted for one-year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until
such time as we have satisfied the commitment secured by the customer performance bond. We are obligated to reimburse the issuer
only if the beneficiary collects on the customer performance bonds. We currently have a customer performance bond outstanding totaling
$09 million which was previously secured under the RBS Citizens line of credit. This performance bond will be transferred under
the recently signed demand line of credit with JP Morgan, but as an interim procedure until the performance bond is transferred,
we signed a Pledge and Security Agreement with RBS Citizens which requires us to reimburse RBS Citizens for all amounts paid under
the customer performance bond. As such, we are holding $09 million in restricted cash with RBS Citizens on our consolidated balance
sheet as of January 31, 2013 to cover this outstanding customer performance bond until this performance bond is transferred under
the JP Morgan demand line. Operating Leases We lease certain of our operating facilities, automobiles and
office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2017. Leases for our facilities typically
contain standard commercial lease provisions, including renewal options and rent escalation clauses. Rental expense under operating
leases was $27 million, $26 million and $31 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future commitments under minimum
lease payments as of January 31, 2012 are as follows amounts in thousands

$4,989 We have non-cancelable purchase commitments for our inventories
of approximately $27 million at January 31, 2013. Indemnification and Warranties We enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business
with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators and suppliers. Most of these agreements require us to defend and/or indemnify
the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third party with respect to our products. From time
to time, we also indemnify customers and business partners for damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating
to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, and environmental claims relating to the use of our products and
services or resulting from the acts or omissions of us, our employees, authorized agents or subcontractors. For example, SeaChange
has received requests from several of its customers for indemnification of patent litigation claims. Management cannot reasonably
estimate any potential losses, but these claims could result in material liability for us.   81
We warrant that our products, including software products, will
substantially perform in accordance with their standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. In addition,
we provide maintenance support to our customers and therefore allocate a portion of the purchase price to the initial warranty
period and recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the warranty period related to both the warranty obligation and the
maintenance support agreement. When we receive revenue for extended warranties beyond the standard duration, it is deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. In the ordinary course of business, we provide minimum purchase
guarantees to certain of our vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand. Although some of these guarantees
provide penalties for cancellations and/or modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand decreases, most of the
guarantees do not. Therefore, as the market demand decreases, we re-evaluate the accounting implications of guarantees and determine
what charges, if any, should be recorded. With respect to our agreements covering product, business or
entity divestitures and acquisitions, we provide certain representations and warranties and agree to indemnify and hold such purchasers
harmless against breaches of such representations, warranties and covenants. With respect to our acquisitions, we may, from time
to time, assume the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. We provide such minimum purchase guarantees and indemnification
obligations after considering the economics of the transaction and other factors including but not limited to the liquidity and
credit risk of the other party in the transaction. We believe that the likelihood is remote that any such arrangement could have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or liquidity. We record liabilities, as disclosed above,
for such guarantees based on our best estimate of probable losses which considers amounts recoverable under any recourse provisions. 11. Stockholders Equity Stock Authorization The Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time
up to an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series. Each such series of preferred stock shall have
the number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges to
be determined by the Board of Directors, including dividend rights, voting rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions,
liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights. No preferred stock has been issued as of January 31, 2013. Stock Repurchase Program On March 28, 2012, our Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock, par value $001 per share, through a stock repurchase
program which expired by its terms on January31, 2013. Under the program, management was authorized to repurchase shares
through Rule 10b5-1 plans, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance
with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management executed a Rule
10b5-1 plan commencing in September 2012. This share repurchase program did not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares
and could have been suspended or discontinued. All repurchases were expected to be funded from
our current cash position. The timing and amount of the shares to be repurchased was based on market conditions and other factors,
including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and alternative investment opportunities. As of January 31, 2013, we repurchased
a total of 764,024 shares of our common stock at an average price of $812 per share and used a total of $62 million of cash,
including fees under this plan.   82
Stock-Based Compensation We use on a modified prospective basis, the provisions of the
authoritative guidance which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
made to employees and directors including employee stock options, RSUs and, prior to its termination, employee stock purchases
related to an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP based on estimated fair values. The fair value of our stock-based
options and performance-based RSUs, less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting
basis, whereas the RSUs and ESPP stock units are amortized on a straight-line basis. We have applied the provisions of authoritative
guidance allowing the use of a simplified method, in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain
vanilla share options. Stock-based compensation includes expense charges for all stock-based
awards to employees and directors. Such awards include option grants, RSU awards, and, prior to its termination, shares expected
to be purchased under an ESPP. The estimated fair value of our stock-based options and performance-based RSUs, less expected forfeitures,
is amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis, whereas the RSUs and ESPP stock units are amortized
on a straight-line basis. The effect of recording stock-based compensation was as follows

stock-based compensation for the year ended January 31, 2013 are not indicative of future amounts. Determining Fair Value Stock Options We record the fair value of most stock options, including rights
granted under the ESPP prior to its termination, using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate
the fair value of stock options include the exercise price, the expected option term, the risk-free interest rate over the options
expected term, the expected annual dividend yield and the expected stock price volatility. The expected option term was determined
using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The expected stock price volatility was established
using a blended volatility, which is an average of the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to
the expected term of the stock option, and the average volatility of our common stock over the most recent one-year and two-year
periods.   83

Options expected term to determine if vesting conditions would be triggered during that term. Stock Option Plans 2011 Compensation and Incentive Plan. On July 20, 2011 our stockholders approved the adoption of our
2011 Compensation and Incentive Plan the 2011 Plan. Under the 2011 Plan the number of shares of common stock that
may be delivered in satisfaction of awards granted under the 2011 Plan is equal to 2,800,000 shares plus the number of expired,
terminated, surrendered or forfeited awards under the Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Compensation and Incentive Plan the
2005 Plan subsequent to July 20, 2011. Upon approval of the 2011 Plan, the 2005 Plan was terminated. The 2011 Plan provides
for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock options with market-based vesting, restricted stock,
RSUs, and other equity based non-stock option awards as determined by the plan administrator for the purchase of up to an aggregate
of 2,800,000 shares of our common stock by officers, employees, consultants and directors of the Company. We may satisfy awards
upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs with newly issued shares or treasury shares. The Board of Directors is responsible
for the administration of the 2011 Plan and determining the term of each award, award exercise price, the number of shares for
which each award is granted and the rate at which each award vests. As of January 31, 2013, there were 857,515 shares available
for future grant. On May 1, 2012, we granted to the Chief Executive Officer 875,000
Market Condition Options to purchase common stock at an exercise price equal to the last reported sale price of the common stock
as of the date of grant. The options have a term of ten years from the date of grant and the number of stock options that vest
is variable depending on the closing price of our publicly-traded common stock. These stock options with market vesting conditions
were valued using the Monte Carlo pricing model.   84
Option awards may be granted to employees at an exercise price
per share of not less than 100% of the fair market value per common share on the date of the grant. RSUs and other equity-based
non-stock option awards may be granted to any officer, employee, director or consultant at a purchase price per share as determined
by the Board of Directors. Awards granted under the 2011 Plan generally vest over three years and expire 10 years from the date
of the grant. Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Compensation and Incentive
Plan The 2005 plan was terminated upon the adoption
of the 2011 Plan on July 20, 2011. No further awards will be granted under the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan provided for the grant
of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, and other non-stock option awards
as determined by the plan administrator for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 2,800,000 shares of our common stock by officers,
employees, consultants and directors of the Company. We may satisfy awards upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs
with either newly issued shares or treasury shares. The Board of Directors is responsible for the administration of the 2005 Plan
and determining the term of each award, award exercise price, number of shares for which each award is granted and the rate at
which each award is exercisable. The following table summarizes the stock

granted during the years ended January 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, was $378, $286, and $370, respectively. As of January 31, 2013,
the unrecognized stock-based compensation related to the unvested stock options was $23 million net of estimated forfeitures.
Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated changes in forfeitures. This cost will
be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of seventeen months. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
ended January 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $05 million, $08 million and $05 million, respectively, with intrinsic value defined
as the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the grant date price. The cash received from employees as a result of employee stock
option exercises during fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $22 million, $18 million, and $21 million, respectively.   85

$1278 Restricted Stock Units Pursuant to the 2011 Plan, we may grant RSUs that entitle the
recipient to acquire shares of our common stock. Awards of RSUs generally vest in equal increments on each of the first three anniversaries
of the grant of the award. Stock-based compensation expense associated with the RSUs is charged for the market value of our stock
on the date of grant, assuming nominal forfeitures, and is amortized over the awards vesting period on a straight-line basis
for awards with only a service condition and graded vesting basis for awards that include both a performance and service condition.
For fiscal 2013, 90,673 RSUs were earned by our executive officers under the Companys fiscal 2013 performance-based plan. The following table summarizes the RSU activity

related to the unvested RSUs was $39 million. This cost will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period
of 21 years. Due to the retirement of our former Chief Executive Officer on December 8, 2011, his unvested RSUs were accounted
for as a modification to the terms and conditions. This modification resulted in the cancellation of unvested restricted awards
with a grant date value of $19 million and recognition of stock compensation expense of $13 million.   86
Employee Stock Purchase Plan In September 1996, our Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders
approved an ESPP, effective January 1, 1997 as amended July 16, 2008, which provided for the issuance of a maximum of 2,200,000
shares of common stock to participating employees who meet eligibility requirements. The Plan was terminated on May 31, 2010. The
purchase price of the stock was 85% of the lesser of the average market price of the common stock on the first or last business
day of each six-month plan period. During fiscal 2011, the number of shares of common stock issued under the ESPP was 135,632 and
the cash received from employees as a result of the ESPP was $07 million. 12. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of the following

marketable securities. For purposes of comprehensive income disclosures, we do not record tax expense or benefits for the net changes
in the foreign currency translation adjustments, as we intend to permanently reinvest all undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries. 13. Segment Information, Significant Customers and Geographic
Information Segment Information Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
evaluated regularly by the Companys senior management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Following
the divestiture of the Broadcast Servers and Storage and Media Services product lines completed in the second quarter of fiscal
2013, the remaining Software and Streaming businesses were organized into one business reporting segment. The reportable segment
was determined based upon the nature of the products offered to customers, the market characteristics of each operating segment
and the Companys management structure. Our operations are now organized into one reportable segment.
This segment includes product revenues from our advertising, back-office including video streamers and in-home gateway product
solutions, related services such as professional services, installation, training, project management, product maintenance, technical
support and software development for those software products.   87

years ended January 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The income tax benefit for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to $12 million
resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for uncertain tax positions in our foreign jurisdictions and $08 million
tax benefit in the Netherlands from the Innovation Box.   89

$2,437 At January 31, 2013, we had federal, state and foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of $154 million, $664 million and $48 million respectively, which can be used to offset future tax liabilities
and expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2016. Utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards may be limited pursuant
to provisions of the respective local jurisdiction. At January 31, 2013, we had a federal capital loss carryforward of $106 million.
This loss can only be utilized to offset capital gains and it expires in fiscal 2018. At January 31, 2013, we had federal and state
research and development credit carryforwards of $74 million and $15 million respectively, and state investment tax credit carryforwards
of $02 million. The federal credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2020, if not utilized. Certain
state credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in fiscal 2014, while certain other credit carryforwards may
be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these credit carryforwards may be limited pursuant to provisions of the respective
local jurisdiction. We also have alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $06 million which are available to reduce future
federal regular income taxes over an indefinite period. We have foreign tax credit carryforwards of $04 million which are available
to reduce future federal regular income taxes. We review quarterly the adequacy of the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets. We have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax
assets and have established a valuation allowance of approximately $193 million for such assets, which are comprised principally
of net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credits, deferred revenue, inventory and stock-based compensation.
If we generate pre-tax income in the future, some portion or all of the valuation allowance could be reversed and a corresponding
increase in net income would be reported in future periods. The valuation allowance increased $70 million from $123 million at
January 31, 2012. At January 31, 2013, we have indefinitely reinvested $690 million
of the cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $58 million of such earnings would be subject
to U.S. taxes if repatriated to the United States. Through January 31, 2013, we have not provided deferred income taxes on the
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the
United States. Non-U.S. income taxes are, however, provided on those foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings with the
exception of ZQ Interactive, LTD based in the British Virgin Islands. Determination of the potential deferred income tax liability
on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if, and
when, remittance occurs.   90
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2013, we recognized an
additional tax expense for unrecognized tax benefits of $36 million. None of the amounts included in the balance of unrecognized
tax benefits at January 31, 2013 of $94 million are related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total
amounts could significantly change during the next twelve months. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain
tax positions in income tax expense. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of the total amounts of gross unrecognized
tax benefits, excluding interest of $03 million is as follows

$6,464 We file income tax returns in U.S. federal jurisdiction, various
state jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations before 2009. However,
the taxing authorities still have the ability to review the propriety of certain tax attributes created in closed years if such
tax attributes are utilized in an open tax year, such as our federal research and development credit carryovers. 15. Employee Benefit Plan We sponsor a 401k retirement savings plan the Plan.
Participation in the Plan is available to full-time employees who meet eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute
up to 90% of their annual salary, subject to certain limitations. We matched contributions up to 50% of the first 6% of compensation.
During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we contributed $17 million, $11 million and $13 million, respectively. We also contribute
to various retirement plans in its international subsidiaries, of which the amounts will vary, according to the local plans specific
to each foreign location. 16. Related Party On September 1, 2009, we completed the acquisition of eventIS
from a holding company in which Erwin van Dommelen, who was employed by us from March 2010 to September 2012, had a 32% interest
in the holding company. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, we paid $366 million upon the closing of the transaction
on September 1, 2009. For more information on this transaction see Note 7., Acquisitions, above. On April, 5, 2012, we purchased 63,000 shares from our former
CEO, William Styslinger, III. The consideration for these shares totaled $05 million at the then current market price of $800
per share. In addition, in connection with his retirement, Mr. Styslinger and SeaChange entered into a separation agreement, dated
as of November 29, 2011. Under the terms of the separation agreement, we agreed to pay Mr. Styslinger $10 million in twelve equal
monthly installments on SeaChanges regular payroll schedule. As of January 31, 2013, we have fulfilled our obligation to
Mr. Styslinger. 17. Quarterly Results of OperationsUnaudited The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly results
