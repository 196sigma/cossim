Sheridan Healthcare, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sheridan
Healthcare, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1997 and 1996, and the related  consolidated  statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flow for each of the  three  years ended
December 31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these 
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sheridan Healthcare
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Miami, Florida,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Organization
Sheridan Healthcare, Inc. the Company was established in November 1994
concurrently with its purchase of the common stock of Sheridan Healthcorp, Inc.
formerly,  Southeastern  Anesthesia  Management  Associates,  Inc.  the
Predecessor  the 1994 Acquisition for $433 million in cash. The
acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the purchase price
was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair market
values at the date of acquisition. The management group of the Predecessor held
approximately 20% of its outstanding common stock prior to the acquisition and
became the management group of the Company, holding approximately 18% of its
outstanding common stock and equivalents after the acquisition. Accordingly, 18%
of the purchase price was considered a distribution to management stockholders
in excess of their basis in the common stock of the Predecessor, which was
approximately $249,000. Such excess is reflected as Excess purchase price
distributed to management stockholders in the accompanying balance sheets and
was not allocated to the net assets acquired. As a result of the allocation 312 million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Company has
more than 50% ownership interest or a controlling financial interest.
In November 1997, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a
consensus on when a physician  practice  management company PPM has
established a controlling financial interest in a physician practice through a
contractual management service agreement MSA. A controlling financial
interest must exist in order for a PPM to consolidate the operations of an
affiliated physician practice. The consensus is addressed in EITF Issue 97-2,
Application of Physician Practice Entities.
A controlling financial interest exists between a PPM and an affiliated
physician practice if all of the following six requirements are met; i the MSA
has a term that is either the entire remaining legal life of the physician
practice entity or a period of 10 years or more; ii the MSA is not terminable
by the physician practice except in the case of gross negligence, fraud or other
illegal acts by the PPM or bankruptcy of the PPM; iii the PPM has exclusive
authority over all decision making relating to ongoing major or central
operations of the physician practice, except for the dispensing of medical
services; iv the PPM has exclusive authority over all decision making related
to total practice compensation of the licensed medical professionals as well as
the ability to establish and implement guidelines for the selection, hiring and
firing of them; v the PPM must have a significant financial interest that is
unilaterally salable or transferable by the PPM; and vi the PPM must have a
significant financial interest that provides it with the right to receive
income, both as on-going fees and as proceeds from the sale of its interest in
the physician practice, in an amount that fluctuates based on the performance of
the operations a net profit interest of the physician practice and the change
in the fair value thereof.
The Company is following the above controlling  financial  interest
provisions of EITF Issue 97-2 in its determination of whether the operations of
an affiliated physician practice qualify for consolidation.                    26               SHERIDAN HEALTHCARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued c Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
d Accounts Receivable and Net Revenue
The Company derives substantially all of its revenues from various
third-party payors including Medicare and Medicaid programs, health maintenance
organizations, commercial insurers and others. The amount of payments received
from such third-party payors is dependent upon mandated payment rates in the
case of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and negotiated payment rates in the
case of other third-party payors, as well as the specific benefits included in
each patient applicable health care coverage. The Company records its revenues
net of an allowance for contractual adjustments which represents the difference
between billed charges and expected collections from third-party payors.
Accordingly,  net revenue and accounts  receivable are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements net of contractual allowances.
The Company receives a portion of its revenue pursuant to shared-risk
capitation arrangements with certain health maintenance organizations. Under
these arrangements, the Company generally agrees to provide certain health care
services to enrollees of the health maintenance organization in exchange for a
fixed amount per enrollee per month. The Company directly provides primary care
services to the enrollees and subcontracts with specialist physicians, hospitals
and other health care providers to provide the remainder of the health care
services to the enrollees. In order for such shared-risk capitation arrangements
to be profitable for the Company, the Company must properly manage the
utilization of health care services by its patients who are subject to such
arrangements. There can be no assurance that the revenue received by the Company
under such arrangements will be adequate to cover the cost of the health care
services it is required to provide.
e Charity Care
The Company has agreed with certain hospitals to provide charity care to
patients who are unable to pay. Such patients are identified based on financial
information obtained from the patients and subsequent analysis. Since management
does not expect payment for such charity care, the estimated charges related to
such patients are included in the provision for bad debts in the accompanying
financial statements.
f Goodwill
Approximately $286 million of the total amount of goodwill, net of
accumulated amortization, at December 31, 1997, is related to the 1994
Acquisition.  Such goodwill represents the Company market position and
reputation, its relationships with its customers and affiliated physicians, the
relationships between its affiliated physicians and their patients, and other
similar intangible assets. Management believes that such assets have useful
lives of indefinite length, and accordingly, such goodwill is being amortized on
a straight-line basis over 40 years.                    27               SHERIDAN HEALTHCARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued   Approximately $147 million of the total amount of goodwill, net of
accumulated  amortization,  at December 31, 1997, is related to several
acquisitions of physician practices by the Company and its Predecessor.
Approximately $109 million of the total amount of goodwill, net of accumulated
amortization at December 31, 1997 is related to several management agreements
entered into by the Company which have been accounted for as purchases. Such
goodwill represents the general reputation of the practices in the communities
they serve, the collective experience of the management and other employees of
the practices in managing health care services delivered under capitation
arrangements, contracts with health maintenance organizations, relationships
between the physicians and their patients, patient lists, and other similar
intangible assets. The Company evaluates the underlying facts and circumstances
related to each acquisition including the term of the management services
agreement and establishes an appropriate amortization period for the related
goodwill. The goodwill related to these physician practice acquisitions is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 40 years.
The Company continuously  evaluates whether events have occurred or
circumstances exist which impact the recoverability of the carrying value of
goodwill, pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed Of. See Note j below for a description of an adjustment to reduce
the carrying values of certain components of goodwill to their net realizable
values during 1996.
Separately identifiable intangible assets related to the 1994 Acquisition
and the physician practice acquisitions are included in intangible assets,
separate from goodwill, and are discussed in Note g below.
g Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of the physician employee workforce,
non-physician employee workforce, management team and computer software acquired
in the 1994 Acquisition, deferred acquisition costs, deferred loan costs and
non-compete covenants related to certain acquisitions of physician practices.
These intangible assets are being amortized over the lives of the underlying
assets or agreements, which range from five to seven years. See Note j below
for a description of an adjustment to reduce the carrying values of certain
intangible assets to their net realizable values during 1996.
h Amounts Due for Acquisitions
Amounts due for  acquisitions  includes  obligations  to the former
stockholders of certain physician practices acquired by the Company. These
payments are being made over the terms of the employment agreements between the
Company and the former stockholders, which range from three to five years. It
also includes termination benefits payable to the former stockholders of an
acquired practice, which are payable beginning in 2001 or upon termination of
their employment by the Company, whichever is later.
i Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures About
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure of the fair value of
certain financial instruments. Accounts receivable, other current assets,
accounts payable, accrued expenses and long-term debt are reflected in the
accompanying financial statements at cost which approximates fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued j Write-down of Office-based Net Assets
On November 4, 1996, the Company announced a change in its strategic
direction, which was to place more emphasis on its hospital-based business and
to reduce its emphasis on the primary care business, and its intent to dispose
of non-strategic office-based physician practices. Due to this change in
strategic direction, the Company wrote down certain assets related to its
office-based operations to their estimated realizable values, and accrued
certain liabilities for commitments that no longer have value to the Company
future operations. These adjustments resulted in a $174 million charge to
earnings in 1996, which is comprised of adjustments to the following assets and
liabilities in thousands

l Cash and Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be a cash equivalent.
m Net Income Loss Per Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share, SFAS No.
128. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the current standards for computing earnings per
share EPS under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15, Earnings per
Share by replacing the existing calculation of primary EPS with a basic EPS
calculation. It requires a dual presentation for complex capital structures of
basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement and requires a
reconciliation of basic EPS factors to diluted EPS factors. The impact of
adopting SFAS No. 128 in 1997 was immaterial. Common stock equivalents, which
consist of stock options issued to employees and directors, are not included in
the determination of the net loss per fully diluted share in 1996 and 1995 since
they would have the effect of reducing the net loss per share.                    29               SHERIDAN HEALTHCARE, INC.

n New Accounting Standards
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 129, Disclosures of Information about
Capital Structure, SFAS No. 129 which is effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 1997. SFAS No. 129 requires disclosing information about an
entity capital structure. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 129 in 1997 was
immaterial.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, SFAS
No. 130, which is required to be adopted in fiscal 1998. This statement
established standards to reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements. This statement
requires that an enterprise a classify items of other comprehensive income by
their nature in financial statements and b display the accumulated balance of
other comprehensive income separately from retained earnings and additional
paid-in capital in the equity section of statements of financial position.
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during the financial
reporting period of a business enterprise resulting from non-owner sources. The
Company currently does not have other comprehensive income and therefore does
not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 130 will have a significant impact on its
financial statement presentation.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, SFAS No. 131, which is required to be
adopted in fiscal 1998. This statement requires that a public business
enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable
operating segments including, among other things, a measure of segment profit or
loss, certain specific revenue and expense items, and segment assets. The
Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 131 will have a significant
impact on its financial statement presentation.
2 ACQUISITIONS
In September 1994, the Predecessor acquired a four-facility primary care
practice for cash and notes and the  assumption of certain  contingent
obligations. The aggregate purchase price was $87 million, including the effect
of certain adjustments to the purchase price recorded in 1995 based on
subsequent information. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and
accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based
on their estimated fair market values. As a result of this allocation, $82
million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill.
In December 1994, the Company acquired an obstetrical practice for $14
million in cash and deferred payments. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase, and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the net assets
acquired based on their estimated fair market values. As a result of this
allocation, $841,000 of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill.
30               SHERIDAN HEALTHCARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued   During the period from February to June 1995, the Company made five
acquisitions of office-based physician practices for an aggregate of $61
million in cash and deferred payments. In a transaction related to one of those
acquisitions, one of the principal physicians operating the acquired practices
assigned a panel services agreement with a health maintenance organization to
the Company for $400,000 in cash plus deferred payments of $935,000 and
approximately 35,000 shares of common stock of the Company. These acquisitions,
including the assignment of the panel services agreement, were accounted for as
purchases, and accordingly, the purchase prices were allocated to the net assets
acquired based on their fair market values. As a result of these allocations 73 million of the aggregate purchase price was allocated to goodwill.
In addition to the purchase prices described above, the Company agreed to
make a deferred payment of $700,000 to a physician employed by one of the
acquired practices, which was paid during the fourth quarter of 1995. This
payment was treated as a bonus for accounting purposes and, accordingly, was
charged to expense in its entirety during 1995.
In March 1996, the Company acquired a hospital-based physician practice for
$42 million in cash and approximately 658,000 shares of the Company common
stock. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and accordingly, the
purchase price was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their fair
market values. As a result of this allocation, $98 million of the purchase
price was allocated to goodwill.
During the period from January to October 1996, the Company made five
acquisitions of office-based physician practices for an aggregate of $82
million in cash and deferred payments. These acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases, and accordingly, the purchase price of each acquisition was allocated
to the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair market values. As a
result of these allocations, $68 million of the aggregate purchase price was
allocated to goodwill.
In connection with the change in the Company strategic direction, as
discussed in Note 1j, the Company has sold a facility acquired in September
1994, three facilities which constituted the practice acquired in June 1995 and
two rheumatology practices acquired during 1996. The Company intends to sell the
remaining three facilities acquired in September 1994 and two primary care
practices acquired in February 1995.
During the period from March 1997 to December 1997, the Company purchased
options to acquire five office-based physician practices and one hospital-based
physician practice for an aggregate of $108 million in cash and approximately
14,000 shares of the Company common stock. Concurrent with each acquisition of
an option the Company entered into a long-term management agreement with each
practice. These transactions were accounted for as purchases, and accordingly,
the purchase price of each option was allocated to the net assets acquired based
on their estimated fair market values. As a result of these allocations, $110
million of the aggregate purchase price was allocated to goodwill.

extended to March 17, 1997. On March 12, 1997, the Company established a new $35
million revolving credit facility, which was used to repay the outstanding
balance under the previous credit facility. Since the outstanding balance under
the previous facility was refinanced on March 12, 1997 using the new credit
facility, and there were no principal payments due in 1997 under the new
facility, the balance is classified as long-term at December 31, 1996 on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. On December 17, 1997 the Company
amended its existing revolving credit facility which increased the amount
available from $35 million to $50 million. No payments are due under the amended
credit facility until December 2000.
The Company was not in compliance with certain covenants under the previous
credit agreement as of December 31, 1996, due to the $174 million write-down of
office-based net assets, which is discussed in Note 1j. However, as discussed
above, the outstanding balance under the previous credit facility was paid in
full in March 1997, and the Company would have been in compliance with all
covenants in the new credit agreement as of December 31, 1996, if the new credit
agreement had been in effect at that date.                    33

Current income tax expense benefit represents the income tax payable
refund receivable for the period. Deferred income tax expense benefit
represents the change in the balance of deferred income taxes during the period.
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company recognizes deferred income taxes for

the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities based on the tax rates
expected to be applicable to the future periods in which such tax consequences
will occur.

7 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
a Major Customers
A significant portion of the Company revenue is derived from delivering
or managing hospital-based physician services at multiple hospitals which are
under common  ownership.  Of the Company  total net revenue in 1997,
approximately $218 million, or 221%, was derived from anesthesia, obstetrics
and neonatology services delivered at three hospitals owned and operated by the
South Broward Hospital District. In addition, approximately $218 million, or
222% of the Company total net revenue in 1997, was derived from anesthesia,
neonatology, pediatric and emergency services delivered at 11 hospitals and two
ambulatory surgical facilities owned and operated by Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp. In addition, approximately $117 million, or 119% of the Company total
net revenue in 1997, was derived from anesthesia, neonatology, pediatric,
emergency and management services delivered at seven hospitals owned and
operated by Tenet Healthcare Corporation.
A significant portion of the Company revenue is derived from delivering
medical services to patients who are covered under various Medicare and Medicaid
health care programs. Approximately 158% of the Company total net revenue in
1997 was derived from the assignment of Medicare and Medicaid benefits to the
Company by patients of the Company affiliated physicians. In addition,
approximately 79% of the Company total net revenue in 1997 was derived from
capitation payments from health maintenance organizations for patients who had
assigned their Medicare or Medicaid benefits to the health  maintenance
organizations.
In addition, the Company derived 143%, 208% and 295% of its total net
revenue in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, from a single third-party payor.
No other third-party payor or other customer accounted for 10% or more of the
Company net revenue.                    35               SHERIDAN HEALTHCARE, INC.

c Self-insurance
Due to the nature of its business, the Company becomes involved as a
defendant in medical malpractice lawsuits, some of which are currently ongoing,
and is subject to the attendant risk of substantial damage awards. The Company
maintains professional and general liability insurance on a claims-made basis in
amounts deemed appropriate by management, based upon historical claims and the
nature and risks of its business. There can be no assurance, however, that an
existing or future claim or claims will not exceed the limits of available
insurance coverage, that any insurer will remain solvent and able to meet its
obligations to provide coverage for any such claim or claims or that such
coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits and at a
reasonable cost to adequately and economically insure the Company operations
in the future. A judgment against the Company in excess of such coverage could
have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The liability for self-insurance accruals in the accompanying balance
sheets includes estimates of the ultimate costs related to both reported claims
and claims incurred but not reported. The estimate of claims incurred but not
reported was  $2,522,000 and $2,095,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. An analysis of the self-insurance accrual is as follows in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued d Litigation
In October 1996, the Company and certain of its directors, officers and
legal advisors were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court
of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida by
certain former physician stockholders of the Company Predecessor. The claim
alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy of fraud and deception for
personal gain in connection with inducing the plaintiffs to sell their stock in
the Predecessor to the Company, as well as legal malpractice and violations of
Florida securities laws. The claim seeks damages of at least $10 million and the
imposition of a constructive trust and disgorgement of stock and options held by
certain members of the Company management. The Company believes the lawsuit is
without merit and continues to vigorously defend against it and also believes
the lawsuit ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse impact on the
financial position of the Company.
e Lease Commitments
The Company leases office space and furniture and equipment for its
physician  practice  locations  and  administrative  office under various
non-cancellable operating leases. Rent expense under operating leases was
$2,475,000, $2,399,000 and $1,716,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Future annual minimum payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of
December 31, 1997 are as follows in thousands

f Government Regulation
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and there can be no assurance
that the regulatory environment in which the Company operates will not change
significantly and adversely in the future. In general, regulation of healthcare
providers and companies is increasing.
Federal and state laws regulate the healthcare industry, the relationship
between practice management companies such as the Company and physicians, and
the relationship among physicians and other providers of healthcare services.
Several laws, including fee-splitting, anti-kickback laws and prohibition
of the corporate practice of medicine, have civil and criminal penalties and
have been subject to limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. They are
enforced by regulatory agencies vested with broad discretion interpreting them.
The Company agreements and proposed activities have not been examined by
federal or state authorities under these laws and regulations. Although the
Company believes that its operations are conducted so as to comply with all of
the applicable laws, there can be no assurance such operations will not be
challenged as in violation of one or more of such laws. In addition, these laws
and their interpretation vary from state to state. The regulatory framework at
certain jurisdictions may limit the Company expansion into or ability to
continue operations within such jurisdictions, if the Company is unable to
modify its operational structure to conform to such regulatory framework. Any
limitation on the Company ability to expand could have an adverse effect on
the Company.
37               SHERIDAN HEALTHCARE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued   There have been numerous initiatives at the federal and state levels for
comprehensive  reforms  affecting the  availability of, and payment for,
healthcare. The Company believes that such initiatives will continue during the
foreseeable future. Certain reforms previously proposed could, if adopted, have
a material effect on the Company.
On August 5, 1997, the President signed into law a number of Medicare
provisions as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. When compared with
projected Medicare levels under current law, the legislation could reduce
Medicare spending by $115 billion over 5 years. The vast majority of these
savings would come from reductions in payments for services of healthcare
facilities, practitioners and other providers. The legislation will eliminate
disparities in payment rates for similar services by physicians in different
specialties effective January 1, 1998. Payment rates for physician services will
no longer be necessarily updated for inflation. Beginning in 1998, inflation
increases will be adjusted based on a sustainable growth rate defined with
reference to the change in i the number of Medicare beneficiaries, ii the
gross domestic product per capita, and iii the level of expenditures for
physician services. The legislation will also revise Medicare payments for
practice expense costs and change payments to managed care plans from the
current rate of 95% of fee-for-service rates in the area, to a nationwide
average per capita fee for service spending, with an adjustment factor for local
area wage rates. Any reductions in payment for the services offered by the
Company could have an adverse effect on the Company results of operations and
financial condition.
8  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
At January 1, 1995 the issued and outstanding stock of the Company
consisted of 409,900 shares of the Company Class A voting common stock held by
management of the Company and 350,000 and 78,572 shares of Class A and Class B
Convertible Preferred Stock, respectively. Each share of Class A and Class B
Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible, at the option of the holder, into
one-fourth of a share of Class A voting and Class B non-voting common stock,

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123 in 1996. As
permitted under SFAS No. 123 the Company has elected to continue using
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, in accounting for employee stock options. Each employee stock option
has an exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant and,
accordingly, no compensation expense has been recorded for any stock option
grants to employees.

either over time, or upon the attainment of defined operating goals. All stock
options granted expire ten years after the date of grant. Stock option activity
