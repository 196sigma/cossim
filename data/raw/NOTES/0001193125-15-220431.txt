Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Board of Directors and Stockholders IXYS
Corporation Milpitas, California We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IXYS Corporation the Company as of March31, 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IXYS Corporation at March31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended March31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, IXYS Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of
March31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report dated June 11,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.Description of Business We design, develop, manufacture and market power semiconductors, digital and analog integrated circuits, or ICs, and systems and radio frequency, or RF, power semiconductors. 
Power semiconductors are used primarily in controlling energy in motor drives, power conversion including uninterruptible power supplies,
or UPS, and switch mode power supplies, or SMPS, and medical electronics. Our power semiconductors convert electricity at relatively high voltage and current levels to create efficient power as required by a specific application. Our target market
includes segments of the power semiconductor market that require medium to high power semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on high power semiconductors. Our power semiconductors include power metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistors, or
Power MOSFETs, insulated-gate bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, thyristors and rectifiers, including fast-recovery epitaxial diodes, or FREDs. Our ICs include solid state relays, or SSRs, for telecommunications applications and power management and
control ICs, such as current regulators, motion controllers, digital power modulators and drivers, and microcontrollers such as embedded flash microcontrollers and 8-bit microcontrollers. Our systems include laser diode drivers, high voltage pulse
generators and modulators, and high power subsystems, sometimes know as stacks, that are principally based on our high power semiconductor devices. We sell products in North America, Europe and Asia through an organization that includes direct sales personnel, independent representatives and distributors. We are headquartered in Northern California
with principal operations in California, Massachusetts, Germany, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. Each site has manufacturing, research and development and sales and distribution activities. We also make use of subcontract manufacturers for
fabrication of wafers and for assembly and test operations. 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IXYS and our wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions. 
Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction The local currency is considered to be the functional currency of some of our wholly-owned international subsidiaries. IXYS Semiconductor GmbH, or IXYS GmbH utilizes the Euro as its functional currency,
while IXYS UK Westcode Limited, or IXYS UK, utilizes the British pound sterling as its functional currency. For such subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at year-end and the revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates during the year. Adjustments resulting from the translation of these accounts of these subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a separate component of
stockholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included as a component of other income or expense. The functional currency is U.S. dollars for our other significant subsidiaries. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from our
estimates. Areas where management uses subjective judgments include, but are not limited to, revenue reserves, inventory valuation, deferred income taxes and related valuation allowances, allocation of purchase price in business combinations,
valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and asset impairment analysis. Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, when delivery has occurred, when
the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. These elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers. Sales with destination point terms are recognized upon
delivery. 
52 Table of Contents
We sell to distributors and original equipment manufacturers. Approximately 556% of our
revenues in fiscal 2015 were from distributors. We provide certain of our distributors with the following programs: stock rotation and ship and debit. Reserves for sales returns and allowances, including allowances for so called ship and debit transactions, are recorded at the time of shipment, based on historical levels of returns and
discounts, current economic trends and changes in customer demand. Accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and
inventory is relieved when title to inventories transfer, typically upon shipment from us, at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms. Under certain circumstances where we are not able to reasonably
and reliably estimate the actual returns, revenues and costs relating to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the distributors end customers. Deferred amounts are presented net and included under
Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Allowance for sales returns.We maintain an
allowance for sales returns for estimated product returns by our customers. We estimate our allowance for sales returns based on our historical return experience, current economic trends, changes in customer demand, known returns we have not
received and other assumptions. If we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, the amount and timing of our revenue could be materially different. Given that our revenues consist of a high volume of relatively similar
products, to date our actual returns and allowances have not fluctuated significantly from period to period, and our returns provisions have historically been reasonably accurate. This allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable
allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction of revenues in the statement of operations. Allowance for stock
rotation.We also provide stock rotation to select distributors. The rotation allows distributors to return a percentage of the previous six months sales. In the fiscal years ended March31, 2015,
2014 and 2013, approximately $17 million, $15 million and $24 million, respectively, of products were returned to us under the program. We establish the stock rotation allowance immediately upon sales except where the revenue recognition is
deferred and recognized on the sale by the distributor of products to the end customer. The allowance, which is managements best estimate of future returns, is based upon the historical experience of returns and inventory levels at the
distributors. This allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction of revenues in the statement of operations. Allowance for ship and debit.Ship and debit is a program designed to assist distributors in meeting competitive prices in the marketplace on sales to their end customers.
Ship and debit requires a request from the distributor for a pricing adjustment for a specific part for a customer sale to be shipped from the distributors stock. We have no obligation to accept this request. However, it is our historical
practice to allow some companies to obtain pricing adjustments for inventory held. We receive periodic statements regarding our products held by our distributors. Ship and debit authorizations may cover current and future distributor activity for a
specific part for sale to a distributors customer. At the time we record sales to distributors, we provide an allowance for the estimated future distributor activity related to such sales since it is probable that such sales to distributors
will result in ship and debit activity. The sales allowance requirement is based on sales during the period, credits issued to distributors, distributor inventory levels, historical trends, market conditions, pricing trends we see in our direct
sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers, and input from sales, marketing and other key management. We believe that the analysis of these inputs enable us to make reliable estimates of future credits under the ship
and debit program. This analysis requires the exercise of significant judgments. Our actual results to date have approximated our estimates. At the time the distributor ships the part from stock, the distributor debits us for the authorized pricing
adjustment. This allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a reduction of revenues in the statement of operations. If competitive pricing were to decrease sharply and unexpectedly, our estimates
might be insufficient, which could significantly adversely affect our operating results. 
53 Table of Contents
Additions to the ship and debit allowance are estimates of the amount of expected future
ship and debit activity related to sales during the period and reduce revenues and gross profit in the period. The following table sets forth the beginning and ending balances of, additions to, and deductions from, the allowance for ship and debit
during the three years ended March31, 2015 in thousands:  Balance March31, 2012 1,101 Additions 5,842 Deductions 5,547 
Balance March31, 2013 1,396 Additions 4,757 Deductions 5,082 
Balance March31, 2014 1,071 Additions 5,765 Deductions 5,777 
Balance March31, 2015 1,059 
We state our revenues net of any taxes collected from customers that are required to be remitted to the
various government agencies. The amount of taxes collected from customers and payable to government is included under Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. 
Trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts.Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the
invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on the aging of our accounts receivable,
the financial condition of our customers and their payment history, our historical write-off experience and other assumptions. The allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly. Past due balances and other specified accounts as necessary are
reviewed individually. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. Actual write-offs may be in excess of the recorded allowance. This
allowance is included as part of the accounts receivable allowance on the balance sheet and as a selling, general and administrative expense in the statement of operations. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include investments in commercial paper and
money market accounts at banks. Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash balances at March31, 2015 and March31, 2014 were $266,000 and $337,000, respectively. The restricted cash
balances constitute funds segregated for pension payments in Germany. Inventories 
Inventories are recorded at the lower of a currently adjusted standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in-first-out basis,
or market value. Our accounting for inventory costing is based on the applicable expenditure incurred, directly or indirectly, in bringing the inventory to its existing condition. Such expenditures include acquisition costs, production costs and
other costs incurred to bring the inventory to its use. As it is impractical to track inventory from the time of purchase to the time of sale for the purpose of specifically identifying inventory cost, inventory is, therefore, valued based on a
standard cost, given that the materials purchased are identical and interchangeable at various production processes. The authoritative guidance provided by Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, requires certain abnormal expenditures to be
recognized as expenses in the current period versus being capitalized in inventory. It also requires that the amount of fixed 
54 Table of Contents
production overhead allocated to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We review our standard costs on an as-needed basis, but in any event at least once a year,
and update them as appropriate to approximate actual costs. We typically plan our production and inventory levels based on
internal forecasts of customer demand, which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially. The value of our inventories is dependent on our estimate of future demand as it relates to historical sales. If our projected demand is
overestimated, we may be required to reduce the valuation of our inventories below cost. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an estimated provision for excess inventory based primarily on our historical sales and expectations
for future use. Actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management. This could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position. If we were to make different judgments or utilize
different estimates, the amount and timing of the write-down of inventories could be materially different. Excess inventory
frequently remains saleable. When excess inventory is sold, it yields a gross profit margin of up to 100%. Sales of excess inventory have the effect of increasing the gross profit margin beyond that which would otherwise occur, because of previous
write-downs. Once inventory is written down below cost, it is not written back up when it is subsequently sold or scrapped. We do not physically segregate excess inventory and assign unique tracking numbers to it in our accounting systems.
Consequently, we cannot isolate the sales prices of excess inventory from the sales prices of non-excess inventory. Therefore, we are unable to report the amount of gross profit resulting from the sale of excess inventory or quantify the favorable
impact of such gross profit on our gross profit margin. The following table provides information on our excess and obsolete
inventory reserve charged against inventory at cost in thousands:  Balance at March31, 2012 28,138 Utilization or sale 2,242 Scrap 3,662 Additional provision 3,385 Foreign currency translation adjustments 330

Balance at March31, 2014 24,304 Utilization or sale 1,637 Scrap 2,901 Additional provision 4,487 Foreign currency translation adjustments 1,500 
Balance at March31, 2015 22,753 
The practical efficiencies of wafer fabrication require the manufacture of semiconductor wafers in minimum
lot sizes. Often, when manufactured, we do not know whether or when all the semiconductors resulting from a lot of wafers will sell. With more than 10,000 different part numbers for semiconductors, excess inventory resulting from the manufacture of
some of those semiconductors will be continual and ordinary. Because the cost of storage is minimal when compared to potential value and because the products of our company do not quickly become obsolete, we expect to hold excess inventory for
potential future sale for years. Consequently, we have no set time line for the sale or scrapping of excess inventory. In
addition, our inventory is also being written down to lower of cost or market or net realizable value. We review our inventory listing on a quarterly basis for an indication of losses being sustained for costs that exceed
55 Table of Contents
selling prices less direct costs to sell. When it is evident that the selling price is lower than current cost, the inventory is marked down accordingly. At March31, 2015 and 2014, our
lower of cost or market reserves were $444,000 and $474,000, respectively. We periodically identify any inventory that is no
longer usable and write it off against recorded reserves. Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment, including equipment under capital leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment under
capital lease is stated at the lower of the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term or the fair value of the leased assets at the inception of the lease. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method
over estimated useful lives of 1 to 14 years for equipment and 24 years to 50 years for property and plant. Upon disposal, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and the resulting gains or losses are reflected
in the statements of operations. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is provided on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. 
The authoritative guidance provided by FASB requires evaluating the recoverability of the carrying amount of our property, plant and
equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows derived for the operation to which the assets relate
are less than the carrying amount including associated intangible assets of the operation. If the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then impairment loss is recognized by reducing the carrying amount
of the long-lived asset group on a pro-rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the assets. Judgment is used when applying
these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test, the undiscounted expected cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of an impaired asset. The dynamic economic environment in which we operate and the resulting
assumptions used to estimate future cash flows affect the outcome of these impairment tests. On June10, 2005, IXYS GmbH,
our German subsidiary, borrowed 100million, or about $122 million at the time, from IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, or IKB. This loan was collateralized by a security interest in our facility in Lampertheim, Germany. In April 2015, we
replaced the loan with a new borrowing of 65million, or about $72 million. The loan is expected to be paid in full by March31, 2022 and is also collateralized by a security interest in our facility in Lampertheim, Germany. See
Note 8, Borrowing and Installment Payment Arrangements and Note 18, Subsequent Events for more details. 
Treasury Stock We account for treasury stock using the cost method. Cost includes fees charged in connection with acquiring treasury stock. Other Assets Other assets include marketable equity securities
classified as available-for-sale and long term equity investments accounted under the equity method. Investments designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other
comprehensive income loss. Realized gains and losses calculated as proceeds less specifically identified costs and declines in value of these investments judged by management to be other than temporary, if any, are included in other income
expense. We have a 45% equity interest in Powersem GmbH, or Powersem, a semiconductor manufacturer based in Germany and a
20% equity interest in EB Tech Ltd., or EB Tech, a radiation services provider based in South Korea. In fiscal 2015, we acquired 243% equity interest in Automated Technology, Inc., or ATEC, an assembly and test services provider in the Philippines.
These investments are accounted for using the equity method. In fiscal 2015, we recognized $140,000 loss on our investment in ATEC. In addition, in fiscal 2015, we recognized income of $7,000 on our investment in Powersem and $126,000 on our
investment in EB Tech Ltd. In fiscal 2014, we recognized income of $115,000 and $188,000 on each of these investments, respectively. In fiscal 2013, we recognized income of $107,000 and $124,000 on each of these investments, respectively.

Transactions for further information regarding the investment balances and the related transactions of those long term equity investments. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of
the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. The costs of acquired intangible assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method or
accelerated method over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance provided by FASB. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for impairment charges during the quarter ending March31, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired, in accordance with the authoritative guidance provided by FASB. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step fair value-based impairment test described below. If
we believe that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.
Under the quantitative approach, there are two steps in the determination of the impairment of goodwill. The first step
compares the carrying amount of the net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. The second step, if necessary, recognizes an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceed the implied fair
value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We operate our business as one reporting unit. 
We assess the recoverability of the finite-lived intangible assets by examining the occurrences of certain events or changes of
circumstances that indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. After our initial assessment, if it is necessary, we perform the impairment test by determining whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in
question are less than their carrying values. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair value and are recognized in operating results. If a useful life is determined to be
shorter than originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets for further discussion of impairment analysis of goodwill and related charges recorded. 
Derivative Financial Instruments Although the majority of our transactions are in U.S. dollars, we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk associated with our operations. From
time to time, we purchase short-term, foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses denominated in foreign
currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the results of operations. The contracts generally have maturity dates that do not exceed six months. We did not have any
open foreign exchange forward and option contracts at March31, 2015. In order to manage our variable interest rate exposure on our former loan from IKB, we entered into an interest rate swap, which will end in June 2015. 
We do not purchase derivative contracts for trading purposes. We elected not to designate these contracts as accounting hedges and any
changes in fair value are marked to market and other income expense, net. See Note4, Fair Value and Note 8, Borrowing and Installment Payment Arrangements for further information on the borrowing from IKB. 
Defined Benefit Plans We maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension costs are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount
rate for plan obligations, assumed rate of return on pension plan assets and assumed rate of compensation increases for plan employees. All of these assumptions are based upon managements judgment, considering all known trends and
uncertainties. Actual results that differ from these assumptions would impact the future expense recognition and 
57 Table of Contents
cash funding requirements of our pension plans. The authoritative guidance provided by FASB requires us to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit
plans in our consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value
for our financial instruments is based on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB in connection with fair value measurements. It defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value
measurements. Carrying amounts of some of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms, the carrying value of notes payable to banks and loans payable approximate fair value and
represent level 2 valuations. Advertising Expense 
We expense advertising as the costs are incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended March31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $437,000 631,000 and $649,000, respectively. Advertising expense is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are
charged to operations as incurred. Income Taxes 
Our provision for income taxes is comprised of our current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse. A valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider income over recent years,
estimated future taxable income, feasible tax planning strategies, and other factors, in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. If we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or a portion of our remaining
deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for
which a valuation allowance has been provided, the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released, which will have the effect of reducing income tax expense. Significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for
income taxes, the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, we may need to
establish or increase an additional valuation allowance that could materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and the continuing need for related valuation allowances are
monitored on an ongoing basis. See Note 16, Income Taxes for further discussion regarding income taxes. 
Other Income and Expense Other income and expense primarily consists of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and interest income and expense, together with our share of income or loss from investments accounted for
on the equity method and other than temporary impairment charges on available-for-sale securities. Indemnification
Product guarantees and warranties have not historically proved to be material. On occasion, we provide limited
indemnification to customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products. To date, we have not experienced significant activity or claims related to such indemnifications. We also provide in the normal course of
business indemnification to our officers, directors and selected parties. We are unable to estimate any potential future liability, if any. Therefore, no liability for these indemnification agreements has been recorded as of March31, 2015 and
2014. 
58 Table of Contents
Legal Contingencies 
We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. The authoritative
guidance provided by FASB requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a
reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Net Income Loss per Share Basic net income lossavailable
per common share is computed using net income lossand the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income loss per common share is computed using net income lossand the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, which includes potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed exercise of stock options and assumed vesting of
restricted stock units using the treasury stock method. See Note 12, Computation of Earnings per Share. 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss represents foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gain or loss on equity investments classified as available-for-sale and minimum
pension liability, net of tax. See Note 11, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss. Concentration
and Business Risks Dependence on Third Parties for Wafer Fabrication and Assembly 
Measured in dollars, in fiscal 2015 we manufactured approximately 540% of our wafers, an integral component of our products, in our
facilities in Germany, the UK, Massachusetts and California. We relied on third party suppliers to provide the remaining 460%. There can be no assurance that material disruptions in supply will not occur in the future. In such event, we may have to
identify and secure additional foundry capacity and may be unable to identify or secure sufficient foundry capacity to meet demand. Even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer, the qualification process could take six months or
longer. If we were unable to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for existing or new products in a timely manner or if such sources were unable to produce semiconductor devices with acceptable manufacturing yields and at acceptable prices, our
business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. Dependence on
Suppliers We purchase silicon substrates from a limited number of vendors, most of whom we do not have long term supply
agreements with. Any of these suppliers could terminate their relationship with us at any time. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers involves several risks, including potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of silicon substrates
and reduced control over the price, timely delivery, reliability and quality of the silicon substrates. There can be no assurance that problems will not occur in the future with suppliers. 
Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Arrangements Approximately 506% and 944% of our employees in the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively, are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. 
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk comprise principally cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. We invest our excess cash in accordance with our investment
policy that has been 
59 Table of Contents
approved by the Board of Directors and is reviewed periodically by management to minimize credit risk. Regarding cash and cash equivalents, the policy authorizes the investment of excess cash in
deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances, commercial paper rated AA or better and other money market accounts and instruments of similar liquidity and credit quality. 
We invest our excess cash primarily in foreign and domestic banks in short term time deposit and money market accounts. Maturities are
generally three months or less. Our non-interest bearing domestic cash balances exceed federally insured limits. Additionally, we may invest in commercial paper with financial institutions that management believes to be creditworthy. These
securities mature within ninety days or less and bear minimal credit risk. We have not experienced any losses on such investments. We sell our products primarily to distributors and original equipment manufacturers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. An allowance for
potential credit losses is maintained by us. See Note 15, Segment and Geographic Information for a discussion of revenues by geography. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, one distributor accounted for 102%, 108% and 103% of our net revenues, respectively. In fiscal 2015 and 2013, another distributor accounted for 105% and 132% of our net
revenues, respectively. We continually monitor the credit risk in our portfolio and mitigate our credit risk exposures in
accordance with the policies approved by our Board of Directors. Stock-Based Compensation Plans 
We have employee equity incentive plans, which are described more fully in Note 10, Employee Equity Incentive Plans. The
authoritative guidance provided by FASB requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair
value. Accordingly, share-based compensation is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award and shares expected to vest. Compensation cost for equity incentive awards is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the authoritative guidance provided by FASB. We use the straight-line attribution method to
recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period of the award. The fair value of issuances under our Employee
Stock Purchase Plan is estimated on the issuance date using the Black-Scholes options pricing model. Recent Accounting
Pronouncements In April 2014, FASB issued changes to the criteria for determining which disposals are required to be
presented as discontinued operations. The changes require a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a
major effect on an entitys operations and financial results. The amendments apply on a prospective basis to disposals of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or afterDecember 15, 2014and interim
periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We expect this guidance to have an impact on our financial statements only in the event of a future disposition which meets the criteria. 
In May 2014, FASB issued a new standard on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers, which includes a single set of rules
and criteria for revenue recognition to be used across all industries. The revenue standards core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of
rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: identify the contract with the
customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance
obligation. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, including interim periods during the annual period. Early adoption is prohibited. In April 2015, FASB proposed deferring the implementation
of the guidance by one year. Different transition methods are available full retrospective 
60 Table of Contents
method, retrospective with certain practical expedients, and a modified retrospective cumulative effect approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on our
consolidated financial statements including selection of the transition method. In August 2014, FASB issued a new standard on
the disclosure of uncertainties about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern. The guidance seeks to define managements responsibility to decide whether there is substantial doubt about an organizations ability to
continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016, including interim periods during the annual period. Early application is
permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have any material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2014, FASB issued a new standard on pushdown accounting in business acquisitions. The standard provides guidance on whether and at what threshold an acquired entity that is a business can
apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements. This standard was effective for us on November18, 2014 and the adoption of the standard did not have significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued the authoritative guidance that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability rather than as an asset. The guidance will be effective for public companies for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2015, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial
statements. An entity is also required in the year of adoption and in interim periods within that year to provide certain disclosures about the change in accounting principle, including the nature of and reason for the change, the transition
method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability. We do not expect this
guidance to have significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 3.Business Combinations
Acquired MCU Business On June27, 2013, we completed the acquisition of an 8-bit microcontroller product line, or the Acquired MCU Business, from the System LSI Division of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. The acquired
product line includes microcontrollers potentially useful in a number of applications, which have to date been principally used in consumer product applications. The acquisition was intended to bolster our product portfolio and empower customers to
utilize products from across our multiple product lines. The aggregate purchase price for the acquired assets was $500
million. The closing payment was $200million and we were obligated to pay $300 million in two installment payments of $150 million each. The first installment and interest were paid on June26, 2014 and the second installment and
interest were paid on December23, 2014. The installment payments and interest were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our audited consolidated balance sheet. 
We incurred $403,000 in legal and consulting costs related to the acquisition in fiscal 2014. The costs incurred were fully expensed and
included in Selling, general and administrative expenses, or SGA expenses, on our audited consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the values of the assets acquired at the acquisition date in thousands:  PurchasePriceAllocation Inventories 800 Property, plant and equipment 36 Identifiable intangible assets 24,000 
Total identifiable net assets 24,836 Goodwill 25,164 
Total purchase price 50,000 
61 Table of Contents
Identifiable intangible assets consisted of developed intellectual property, customer
relationships, contract backlog and a non-competition agreement. The valuation of the acquired intangibles was classified as a Level 3 measurement under the fair value measurement guidance, because the valuation was based on significant unobservable
inputs and involved management judgment and assumptions about market participants and pricing. In determining fair value of the acquired intangible assets, we determined the appropriate unit of measure, the exit market and the highest and best use
for the assets. The income approach and cost approach were used to estimate the fair value. The income approach indicates the fair value of an asset based on the value of the cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate in the future
through a discounted cash flow method. The income approach was used to determine the fair values of developed intellectual property, the non-competition agreement, contract backlog and customer relationships. The goodwill arising from the
acquisition was largely attributable to the synergies expected to be realized after our acquisition and integration of the Acquired MCU Business. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. See Note 7, Goodwill and Intangible Assets
for the valuation of identified intangible assets resulting from the acquisition. The Acquired MCU Business contributed
revenues of $400 million and $361 million in our audited consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. As the Acquired MCU Business is fully integrated within our existing operations we are not able to
calculate and report the net income contribution specific to the Acquired MCU Business. Supplemental Pro Forma
Financial Information The following pro forma summary gives effect to the acquisition of the Acquired MCU Business as
if it had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2013. The pro forma financial information reflects the business combination accounting effects resulting from this acquisition including our amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, the
acquisition related expenses and the interest expenses on installment payments of the acquisition. The summary is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations for future periods.
The Acquired MCU Businesss fiscal year ended on December31, while our fiscal year ends on March31. As such,
the financial information of the Acquired MCU Business is included in the following unaudited pro forma table so as to align with the reporting periods of our fiscal quarters. In the following unaudited pro forma table, the financial information for
fiscal 2014 includes the historical financial results of IXYS Corporation for the twelve months ended March31, 2014 and the historical financial results of the Acquired MCU Business for the three months ended March31, 2013; the financial
information for fiscal 2013 includes the historical financial results of IXYS Corporation for the twelve months ended March31, 2013 and the historical financial results of the Acquired MCU Business for the twelve months ended December31,

Other Acquisition In the quarter ended June30, 2014, we completed a business acquisition for a cash consideration of $23million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition resulted in a goodwill of $28 million and
we assumed debt of $723,000. The goodwill balance as of March31, 2015 reflected a cumulative reduction of $570,000 caused by changes in the foreign exchange translation rate. This acquisition was not significant to our audited consolidated
financial statements for the current period.

4.Fair Value 
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. In determining fair value, we consider its principal or most advantageous
market and the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing, such as inherent risk, restrictions on sale and risk of non-performance.The fair value hierarchy is based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation
techniques. Observable inputs highest level reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs lowest level reflect internally developed market assumptions. The fair value measurements are classified under the
following hierarchy:  Level1
Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  Level2
Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations
in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.  Level3
Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. 
Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components, consisted of the following types of instruments as of March31, 2015 and 2014 in

Included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our audited consolidated balance sheets. 
We measure our marketable securities and derivative contracts at fair value. Marketable securities are valued using the quoted market
prices and are therefore classified as Level 1 estimates. All of the marketable equity securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. We review any impairment to determine whether it is other than temporarily impaired. This review is based
on factors such as length of time of impairment, extent to which the fair value is below the cost basis, financial conditions of the issuer of the security, our expectations of future recoveries and, our ability and intent to hold or sell the
securities. Based on our review, we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of $19 million in marketable equity securities during fiscal 2015. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, and the fair values of these instruments are recorded on the balance sheets.
We have elected not to designate these instruments as accounting hedges. The changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in the current periods statement of operations and are included in other income expense, net. All of our
derivative instruments are traded on over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For those derivatives, we measure fair value using prices obtained from the counterparties with whom we have traded. The
counterparties price the derivatives based on models that use primarily market observable inputs, such as yield curves and option volatilities. Accordingly, we classify these derivatives as Level 2. See Note 8, Borrowing and Installment
Payment Arrangements for further information regarding the terms of the derivative contract. 
63 Table of Contents
Auction rate preferred securities, or ARPS, are stated at par value based upon observable
inputs including historical redemptions received from the ARPS issuers. All of our ARPS have credit ratings of at least AA, are 100% collateralized and continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual terms. Additionally, the
collateralized asset value ranges exceed the value of our ARPS by approximately 300 percent. Accordingly, the remaining ARPS balance was categorized as Level 2 for fair value measurement in accordance with the authoritative guidance provided by FASB
and was recorded at full par value on the audited consolidated balance sheets as of March31, 2015 and 2014. We currently believe that the ARPS values are not impaired and as such, no impairment has been recognized against the investment. If
future auctions fail to materialize and the credit rating of the issuers deteriorates, we may be required to record an impairment charge against the value of our ARPS. Cash and cash equivalents are recognized and measured at fair value in our consolidated financial statements. Accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets are financial assets with
carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. 
Our pension liabilities, net of plan assets approximate fair value. See Note 9, Pension Plans for a discussion of pension
liabilities. Our indebtedness for borrowed money and our installment payment obligations approximated fair value, as the interest rates either adjusted according to the market rates or the interest rates approximated the market rates. The estimated
fair value of these items was approximately $492 million and $516 million at March31, 2015 and March31, 2014, respectively. Our indebtedness for borrowed money, which primarily consists of loans from banks, and our installment payment
obligations at March31, 2014, which consisted of the installment payments for our Acquired MCU Business, are categorized as Level 2 for fair value measurement. 5.Other Assets Other assets consist of the

Total 13,704 11,781 
In fiscal 2015 and 2014, based on evaluation of available evidence we concluded that certain marketable
equity securities had impairment other than temporary. As aresult, we realized an impairment loss totaling $19million and $7,000 in each fiscal year, respectively. Available-for-sale investment securities have been stated at their fair
value as of March31, 2015 and include an unrealized gain, net of taxes, of $7,000 at March31, 2015, and an unrealized gain, net of taxes, of $325,000 at March31, 2014. 
On December12, 2014, we acquired 243% of the outstanding common shares of ATEC for a purchase price of $59 million. ATEC is a
supplier located in the Philippines that provides assembly and test services and the acquisition is part of a vertical integration strategy. The investment is accounted for by the equity method and is included in Other assets on our
audited consolidated balance sheet. The investment was initially recorded at cost. Subsequent periodic adjustments to cost are
made to record our share in the operating results of ATEC subsequent cash contributions and distributions and our share of the differences between the fair value and carrying cost of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In fiscal 2015, we
recognized $140,000 loss on our investment in ATEC. We incurred approximately $14,000 in legal and consulting expense for the
transaction. The costs incurred were expensed and included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our audited consolidated statements of operations.

7.Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions. The acquisition of the Acquired MCU Business was
completed in June 2013 and resulted in goodwill of $252 million. We recorded goodwill of $28 million related to an acquisition completed during the fiscal 2015 and the goodwill balance as of March31, 2015 reflected changes in the foreign
exchange translation rate. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended March31, 2015 and 2014 are

8.Borrowing and Installment Payment Arrangements 
Bank of the West On December6, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of the West, or BOTW, for a revolving line of credit of $500 million. All amounts owed under the credit
agreement are due 
67 Table of Contents
and payable on November30, 2015. Borrowings may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time during the term of the credit agreement. The obligations are guaranteed by two of our subsidiaries. At
March31, 2015, the outstanding principal under the credit agreement was $450 million. The credit agreement provides
different interest rate alternatives under which we may borrow funds. We may elect to borrow based on LIBOR plus a margin, an alternative base rate plus a margin or a floating rate plus a margin. The margin can range from 075% to 25%, depending on
interest rate alternatives and on our leverage of liabilities to effective tangible net worth. The effective interest rate as of March31, 2015 was 194%. An unused commitment fee is also payable. It ranges from 025% to 0625%, depending on
leverage. The credit agreement is subject to a set of financial covenants, including minimum effective tangible net worth, the
ratio of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable to current liabilities, profitability, a leverage ratio and a minimum amount of U.S. domestic cash on hand. As of March31, 2015, we complied with all of these financial covenants.
The credit agreement also includes a $30 million letter of credit subfacility. See Note 17, Commitments and
Contingencies for further information regarding the terms of the subfacility. IKB Deutsche Industriebank
On June10, 2005, IXYS Semiconductor GmbH, our German subsidiary, borrowed 100million, or about
$122 million at the time, from IKB. This loan was collateralized by a security interest in our facility in Lampertheim, Germany and was to be paid in full by June30, 2020. The outstanding balance at March31, 2015 was
35million, or $38 million. The interest rate on the loan was determined by adding the then effective three month
Euribor rate and a margin. The margin ranged from 07% to 125%, depending on the calculation of a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow for our German subsidiary. In June 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement commencing June30,
2010. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 199% and expires on June30, 2015. The effective interest rate on the loan as of March31, 2015 was 269%. The swap is not designated as a hedge in the financial statements. See Note
4, Fair Value for further information regarding the derivative contract. During each fiscal quarter, a principal
payment of 167,000, or about $181,000, and a payment of accrued interest were required. Financial covenants included a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow, a ratio of equity to total assets and a minimum stockholders equity for the German
subsidiary. At March31, 2015, we complied with the financial covenants. In April 2015, we replaced the loan with a new
loan from IKB. Under the new agreement, we borrowed 65million, or about $72 million at the time. The loan has a term ending March31, 2022 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 175%. Each fiscal quarter a principal payment of
232,000, or $256,000, and a payment of accrued interest are required. Financial covenants for a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow, a ratio of equity to total assets and a minimum stockholders equity for the German subsidiary must be
satisfied for the loan to remain in good standing. The loan may be prepaid in whole or in part with a modest penalty. The loan is also collateralized by a security interest in the facility in Lampertheim, Germany. 
Acquired MCU Business Installment Payments We were obligated to pay $300 million in two installment payments of $150 million each as partial purchase price for the Acquired MCU Business. The first installment and interest were paid on
June26, 2014 and the second installment and interest were paid on December23, 2014. The installment payments and interest accrual were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our March31, 2014
audited consolidated balance sheet. Loans Assumed from Business Acquisition 
We assumed loans of approximately $723,000 related to an acquisition completed during the quarter ended June30, 2014. The assumed
borrowings were non-interest loans from government agencies to support the research and development activities with maturity dates varying from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021, other than a loan of $99,000 that we paid off during the quarter ended
September30, 2014.

9.Pension Plans We maintain three defined benefit pension plans: one for United Kingdom employees, one for German employees, and one for Philippine employees. We deposit funds for these plans, consistent with the
requirements of local law, with investment management companies, insurance companies, banks or trustees and accrue for the unfunded portion of the obligations. The measurement date for the projected benefit obligations and the plan assets is
March31. The United Kingdom and German plans have been curtailed. As such, the plans are closed to new entrants and no credit is provided for additional periods of service.

Information on Plan Assets 
We report and measure the plan assets of our defined benefit pension plans at fair value. The table below sets forth the fair value of our
plan assets as of March31, 2015 and 2014, using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 4, Fair Value in thousands:  March31, 2015 March31, 2014 Description

The expected long term rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the returns expected for the
underlying broad asset classes. The expected returns for each asset class are estimated in light of the market conditions on the accounting date and the past performance of the asset classes generally. 
The amount of accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost in fiscal 2016 includes
amortization of actuarial loss of $189,000. Approximately 68% of the accrued pension liability relates to the German plan and 31% to the United Kingdom plan. The accrued pension liability related to the Philippine plan is immaterial. 
The investment policies and strategies for the United Kingdom plan assets are determined by the respective plans trustees in
consultation with independent investment consultants and the employer. Our practice is to fund these plans in amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements of local laws and regulations. The trustees are aware that the nature of the
liabilities of the plans will evolve as the age profile and life expectancy of the membership changes. These changing liability profiles lead to consultations about the appropriate balance of investment assets to be used by the plans equity, debt,
other, as well as timescales, within which required adjustments should be implemented. The plan assets in the United Kingdom are held in pooled investment funds operated by Fidelity Worldwide Investments. Our plan assets do not include direct
holdings of our securities. The investment managers have discretion to vary the balance of investments of the scheme according to prevailing investment conditions and the trustees regularly monitor all investment decisions affecting the scheme and
the overall investment performance. At March31, 2015, approximately 79% of the assets of the United Kingdom fund were invested in equity securities while 21% were in debt securities. The investments in debt securities are made in government
instruments and investment grade corporate bonds. The target allocation of the United Kingdom plan assets that we control is 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income instruments. This objective has not been achieved due to the relative investment
return of the two asset classes. The German plan was held by a separate legal entity. As of March31, 2015, the German
defined benefit plan was completely unfunded. For our Philippine plan, the local law requires us to appoint a trustee for the
fund. We have appointed Bank of the Philippine Islands, or BPI, as the trustee of the plan. The plan assets are fully invested with BPI. The main role of the trustee is to manage the fund according to the mandate given by the retirement committee of
our Philippine entity and to pay the covered/eligible employees in accordance with the plan. BPI Asset Management and Trust Group, an independent unit of BPI, provides investment management services to the trustee. At March31, 2015,
approximately 62% of the assets of the fund were invested in fixed income securities, 33% in equity securities and 5% in cash. The target allocation for the Philippine fund was 75% to fixed income securities, 20% to equities and 5% to cash and cash
equivalents. We expect to make contributions to the plans of approximately $994,000 in the fiscal year ending March31,
2016. This contribution is primary contractual.

10.Employee Equity Incentive Plans 
Stock Purchase and Stock Option Plans The 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan On September10, 2009, our stockholders approved the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan, under which 900,000 shares of our common stock are reserved for the grant of stock options and other
equity incentives. On September16, 2011, our stockholders approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2011 Plan, under which 600,000 shares of our common stock are reserved for the grant of stock options and other equity incentives. On
August30, 2013, our stockholders approved the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2013 Plan, under which 2,000,000 shares of our common stock are reserved for the grant of stock options and other equity incentives. The 2009 Plan, the 2011 Plan
and the 2013 Plan are referred to as the Plans. Stock Options 
Under the Plans, nonqualified and incentive stock options may be granted to employees, consultants and non-employee directors. Generally,
the per share exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share on the grant date. The Board of Directors has the full power to determine the provisions of each option issued under the Plans. While we may grant options
that become exercisable at different times or within different periods, we have primarily granted options that vest over four years. The options, once granted, expire ten years from the date of grant. 
Stock Awards Stock awards, denominated restricted stock under the 2009 Plan and the 2011 Plan, may be granted to any employee, director or consultant under the Plans. Pursuant to a stock award, we will issue shares of
common stock. Shares that are subject to the restriction will be released from restriction if certain requirements, including continued performance of services, are met. Stock Appreciation Rights Awards of stock appreciation rights, or SARs,
may be granted to employees, consultants and non-employee directors pursuant to the Plans. A SAR is payable on the difference between the market price at the time of exercise and the exercise price at the date of grant. In any event, the exercise
price of a SAR shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share on the grant date and shall expire no later than ten years from the grant date. Upon exercise, the holder of a SAR shall be entitled to receive payment either in cash or
a number of shares by dividing such cash amount by the fair market value of a share on the exercise date. Restricted Stock
Units Restricted stock units, denominated performance units in the 2009 Plan, may be granted to employees, consultants and
non-employee directors under the Plans. Each restricted stock unit shall have a value equal to the fair market value of one share. After the applicable performance period has ended, the holder will be entitled to
72 Table of Contents
receive a payment, either in cash or in the form of shares, based on the number of restricted stock units earned over the performance period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which
the corresponding performance goals or other vesting provisions have been achieved. The 1999 Equity Incentive Plan and the
1999 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan Prior to May 2009, stock options were granted under the 1999
Equity Incentive Plan and the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan, or the 1999 Plans, for not less than 85% of fair market value at the time of grant. Once granted, the options expire ten years from the date of grant. Options
granted to employees under the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan typically vested over four years. The initial option grants under the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan typically vested over four years and subsequent annual grants
vested over one year. The 1999 Plans expired in May 2009 and no additional grants may be made thereunder. Zilog 2004
Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan The Zilog 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, or the Zilog 2004 Plan, was approved by the
stockholders of Zilog in 2004, and was amended and approved by the stockholders of Zilog in 2007. In connection with the acquisition of Zilog, our Board of Directors approved assumption of the Zilog 2004 Plan. Employees of Zilog and persons first
employed by our company after the closing of the acquisition of Zilog were eligible to receive grants under the Zilog 2004 Plan. Under the 2004 Plan, non-statutory stock options were granted. At the time of the assumption of the Zilog 2004 Plan by
our company, up to 652,963 shares of our common stock were available for grant under the plan. In general, the options and
shares granted pursuant to the Zilog 2004 Plan are exercisable at such time or times, and subject to such terms and conditions including the vesting schedule, period of exercisability and expiration date as the plan administrator, generally the
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, determined in the applicable option agreement. The exercise price per share, payable upon the exercise of an option, was established by such administrator at the time of the grant and is not less
than the par value per share of common stock on the date of the grant and, in the case of an incentive stock option, generally is not less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. The Zilog 2004 Plan expired in February
2014 and no additional grants may be made thereunder. Zilog 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan 
The Zilog 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, or the Zilog 2002 Plan, was adopted in 2002. In connection with the acquisition of Zilog, our
Board of Directors approved the assumption of the Zilog 2002 Plan with respect to the shares available for grant as stock options. Employees of Zilog and persons first employed by our company after the closing of the acquisition of Zilog were
eligible to receive grants under the Zilog 2002 Plan. At the time of the assumption of the Zilog 2002 Plan by our company, up to 366,589 shares of our common stock were available for grant under the plan. 
Stock options granted under the Zilog 2002 Plan were permitted to be: iincentive stock options or nonqualified stock options or
iiEBITDA-linked options and/or non-EBITDA linked options. We did not grant any EBITDA-linked options and none are outstanding. In general, non-EBITDA-linked options granted pursuant to the Zilog 2002 Plan was exercisable at such time or
times and subject to such terms and conditions including the vesting schedule, period of exercisability and expiration date as determined by the plan administrator in the applicable award agreements or thereafter. The exercise price per share
payable upon the exercise of an option was established by such administrator at the time of grant. The term of each non-EBITDA-linked option was determined at the time of grant and does not exceed ten years. The Zilog 2002 Plan expired in May 2012
and no additional grants may be made thereunder. Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
The Board of Directors has approved the Amended and Restated 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the Purchase Plan, and reserved a total
of 1,550,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Purchase Plan. Under the Purchase Plan, all eligible employees may purchase our common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the offer
period or the semi-annual purchase date. Stock 
73 Table of Contents
purchases are limited to 15% of an employees eligible compensation. During the year ended March31, 2015, there were 99,975 shares purchased under the Purchase Plan, leaving
approximately 337,515 shares available for purchase under the Purchase Plan in the future. Fair Value of Stock
Compensation The authoritative guidance provided by FASB requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares
under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method and requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value. Accordingly, share-based compensation is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of
the award. Compensation cost for equity incentive awards is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with
the authoritative guidance provided by FASB. We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period of the award. The fair value of issuances under our Purchase Plan is estimated on the issuance date and using the Black-Scholes options pricing model, consistent with the requirements of the authoritative guidance
provided by FASB. The following table summarizes the effects of share-based compensation expenses recognized on our
consolidated statement of operations resulting from options granted under our equity incentive plans and rights to acquire stock granted under our Purchase Plan in thousands: Year Ended March31 Statement of Operations Classifications

As of March31, 2015, there were $43 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
stock options granted. The unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 24 years. The weighted average estimated values of employee stock option grants and rights granted under the Purchase Plan, as well as the weighted average assumptions that were used in calculating such values
during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, were based on estimates at the date of grant as follows:  Stock Options Purchase Plan Year Ended March31 Year Ended March31 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Weighted average estimated per share fair value of grant 554 531 526 290 275 322 Risk-free interest rate 18 18 11 01 01 02 Expected term in years 625 605 634 050 050 050 Volatility 522 549 553 369 370 464 Dividend yield1 10 10 0 11 0 0  1
Prior to October1, 2013, the fair value of our equity awards was based on 0% dividend yield. 
We estimate the expected term of options granted based on the historical average period over which the options are exercised by employees.
We estimate the volatility of our common stock based on historical volatility measures. We base the risk-free interest rate that is used in the option valuation model on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected
term of the options. After establishing a history of quarterly dividend payments, we started using a dividend yield during the
quarter ended December31, 2013. We estimate the dividend yield based on the historical trend and our 
74 Table of Contents
expectation of future dividends. Dividend yield is calculated based on the annualized cash dividends per share declared during the quarter and the closing stock price on the date of grant. In the
case of the Purchase Plan, the dividend yield calculation was first effective for the grant date of June1, 2014. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grants and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. All stock-based payment awards are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. We recognize
the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock over the vesting term. The estimated compensation cost is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize the compensation cost relating to stock bonuses on the date of grant based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant, as such stock bonuses are vested immediately. We did not
grant any bonus shares during fiscal 2015. Stock compensation activity under our equity incentive plans for fiscal 2015, 2014
and 2013 is summarized below:  SharesAvailablefor Grant Options Outstanding WeightedAverageExercise Price perShare Number ofShares1 IntrinsicValue2 000 Balances, March31, 2012 748,036 5,472,004 19,532 975 Plan authorization expired 589 Options granted 455,000 455,000 993 Options exercised 153,131 443 703 Options cancelled 7,500 67,425 834 Options expired 378,975 731

12.Computation of Earnings per Share 
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows in thousands, except per share amounts: Year Ended March31 2015 2014 2013 Net income 23,740 6,046 7,648 
Weighted average shares basic 31,531 31,146 31,025 
Weighted average shares diluted 32,239 31,916 31,695 
Net income per share basic 075 019 025 
Net income per share diluted 074 019 024 
Diluted weighted average shares include approximately 708,000, 770,000 and 670,000 common equivalent
shares from stock options for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Basic net income available per common share is
computed using net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed using net income and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, assuming
dilution, which includes potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were
outstanding options to purchase 2,357,772, 2,483,106 and 2,660,163 shares, respectively, at weighted average exercise prices of $1224, $1193 and $1186 per share, respectively, that were not included in the computation of dilutive net income per
share since the exercise prices of the options exceeded the market price of the common stock and thus their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. These options could dilute earnings per share in future periods if the market price of the common stock
increases. 13.Related Party Transactions 
We own 45% of the outstanding equity of Powersem, a module manufacturer based in Germany. The investment is accounted for using the equity
method. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded revenues of $18 million, $21 million and $13 million, respectively, from sales of products to Powersem for use as components in their products. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we purchased $40
million, $52 million and $29million, respectively, of products from Powersem. In fiscal 2014, we recorded approximately $43,000 in dividend income from Powersem. At March31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the accounts receivable balances from
our sales to Powersem were $82,000, $74,000 and $121,000, respectively. The accounts payable balances to Powersem, as of March31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, were $115,000, $137,000 and $59,000, respectively. 
77 Table of Contents

technology based in South Korea. The investment is accounted for using the equity method. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, EB Tech rendered processing services totaling approximately $278,000, $211,000 and $121,000, respectively, to our company. As of
March31, 2015, our accounts payable balance to EB Tech was $23,000. There was no accounts payable balance due to EB Tech as of March31, 2014. On December12, 2014, we acquired 243% of the outstanding common shares of ATEC, a supplier located in the Philippines that provides assembly and test services. The investment is accounted for by
the equity method. In fiscal 2015, ATEC rendered assembly and test services totaling approximately $20 million to our company. As of March31, 2015, the accounts payable balance to ATEC was $632,000. 
We had no other material related party transactions with companies in which we invested and which were accounted for by the equity method
during fiscal 2015. 
14.Employee Savings and Retirement Plans 
We have a 401k plan, known as the IXYS Corporation and Subsidiary Employee Savings and Retirement Plan.
Eligibility to participate in the plan is subject to certain minimum service requirements. Employees may voluntarily contribute up to the limit prescribed by law and we may make matching contributions in our discretion. Employees are 100% vested

The authoritative guidance provided by FASB requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized
for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, computed at the expected tax rates for the periods in which the assets or liabilities will be realized, as well as for the expected tax benefit
of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax
assets. Our management evaluates the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance provided by FASB. Our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets and the continuing need for a related valuation
allowance are being monitored on an ongoing basis. During fiscal 2015, we recorded certain adjustments on the valuation allowance, tax contingency reserves and other temporary items. The impact of these adjustments is discussed further in this note.
At March31, 2015, we had U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $775 million, all of which are subject
to the limitations under Section382 of the U.S. tax code resulting from a change in ownership. These carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, from fiscal 2016 to 2023 for U.S. tax purposes. None of the U.S. net operating loss carryforwards
include stock option deductions arising from our stock option plan. As of 
81 Table of Contents
March31, 2015 we had net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax purposes of approximately $91million with a corresponding valuation allowance of $89 million.
Increases in the valuation allowance in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were $32,000 and $87,000, respectively, and were primarily
related to net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions, including Spain and Switzerland. At the end of fiscal 2015, we had
$82million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. The $82 million has been classified under Other Long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our liability
for unrecognized tax benefits increased by $12 million from the prior year, principally due to an increase in current year adjustments of $40 million and an increase of $406,000 in accrued interest and penalties. The liability for unrecognized tax
benefits was offset by the lapse of statutes of limitation in respect of certain tax positions. We do not anticipate any unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12months that would result in a material change to our financial position.
We include interest and penalties in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense. We had $10 million of
accrued interest and penalties at March31, 2015, which included $406,000 of interest and penalties accrued for the year ended March31, 2015. The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows in thousands:  Balance as of March31, 2012 6,318 Lapse of statute of limitations 827 Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods 281 Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during the current period 964

Balance as of March31, 2015 8,156 
As of March31, 2015, U.S. income taxes were not provided for on a cumulative total of approximately
$1107 million of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. If these earnings were distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, or
if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the amount
of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986,
the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events that may restrict utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards include, but are
not limited to, certain ownership change limitations and continuity of business requirements, as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section382 and similar state provisions. Current utilization of carryforwards is restricted by an annual
limitation, which results in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards before they can be utilized. We conduct business globally and, as a result, we file income tax returns in various jurisdictions throughout the world including the U.S. federal and various U.S. state jurisdictions as well as with
various foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. We remain subject to U.S. federal examination for years from 2005 and forward by virtue of the tax attributes
carrying forward from those years. We also remain subject to examination in most jurisdictions for all years since 2010.

Rent expense for fiscal years ended March31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $14 million, $14
million and $13 million, respectively. As of March31, 2015 and 2014, we had cash deposits with financial institutions
of $266,000 and $337,000, respectively, which were restricted as to use and represent funds segregated for pension payments in Germany. These balances are included in restricted cash on our balance sheets. 
Bank of the West On December6, 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with BOTW, for a revolving line of credit of $500 million. All amounts owed under the credit agreement are due and
payable on November30, 2015. Borrowings may be repaid and re-borrowed at any time during the term of the credit agreement. The obligations are guaranteed by two of our subsidiaries. The credit agreement includes a letter of credit subfacility,
under which BOTW agrees to issue letters of credit of up to $30 million. However, borrowing under this subfacility is limited to the extent of availability under the $500 million revolving line of credit. At March31, 2015, the outstanding
principal under the credit agreement was $450 million. See Note 8, Borrowing and Installment Payment Arrangements for further information regarding the terms of the credit agreement. 
Other Commitments and Contingencies On occasion, we provide limited indemnification to customers against intellectual property infringement claims related to our products. To date, we have not experienced significant activity or claims
related to such indemnifications. We also provide in the normal course of business indemnification to our officers, directors and selected parties. We are unable to estimate any potential future liability, if any. Therefore, no liability for these
indemnification agreements has been recorded as of March31, 2015 and 2014. 18.Subsequent Events
On May1, 2015, we acquired RadioPulse, Inc., or RadioPulse. RadioPulse is a Korean semiconductor company that
focuses on wireless connectivity in various market applications. At closing, we paid cash consideration of $149 million. The total consideration may also include earnout payments aggregating up to $60million payable over three years. We are
currently in the process of finalizing the valuation of the assets 
83 Table of Contents
acquired and liabilities assumed. During the year ended December31, 2014, RadioPulses revenues were approximately $79 million. We incurred $193,000 in legal and consulting costs in
connection with the acquisition. In April 2015, we entered into a 65million, or about $72 million at the time,
loan agreement with IKB. The agreement replaced our loan with IKB as of March31, 2015. The new loan has a term ending March31, 2022 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 175%. The loan is collateralized by a security interest in the
facility in Lampertheim, Germany. See Note 8, Borrowing and Installment Payment Arrangements for further information about the borrowing.

The sum of the four quarterly calculations of net income per share are not equal to the annual net income per share due to the use of quarterly weighted average shares
used to determine the quarterly net income per share as compared to the annual weighted average shares used to determine the annual net income per share.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act as of March31, 2015. This evaluation included various processes that were carried out in an effort to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC. In this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
considered whether our disclosure controls and procedures were also effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. This evaluation also included consideration of certain aspects of our internal controls and procedures for the preparation of
our financial statements. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of March31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013, which was issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Our management has concluded that, as of March31, 2015, our internal control
over financial reporting was effective. BDO USA, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included elsewhere herein. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes
to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our procedures or our internal
controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of our controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, IXYS Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of March31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of IXYS Corporation as of March31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March31, 2015 and our report dated June 11, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/BDO USA, LLP San Francisco, California
