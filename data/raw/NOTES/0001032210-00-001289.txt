The Report of Independent Auditors, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial
Statements follow on pages 33 through 51.
32             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
Sonic Solutions   We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sonic Solutions as of
March 31, 1999 and 2000, and the related statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March
31, 2000 and the related financial statement schedule. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Sonic
Solutions' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Sonic Solutions as of March
31, 1999 and 2000 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2000, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000
1 SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Operations
We develop workstations used by professionals to edit and process digital
audio and digital video. Our products are computer based, and usually include
both plug-in hardware and applications software installed on a personal
computer. Our customers use various kinds of peripheral devices -- for example,
disk drives, streaming tape drives, and audio and video tape recorders -- along
with our products. Although we do not manufacture or sell the personal computer
or peripheral devices used with our products, we typically talk about the
complete configuration of personal computer, Sonic hardware, Sonic software, and
peripherals as a Sonic workstation.
We currently market two workstation product lines: SonicStudioTM and DVD
CreatorTM. SonicStudio is a line of professional audio workstations that our
customers use to prepare audio for release on digital audio compact discs, for
release with video and film entertainment, and for broadcast on radio. DVD
Creator is a line of DVD-Video/Audio production workstations which supports the
preparation and assembly of video and audio assets for release on the new DVD-
Video disc format and the upcoming DVD-Audio disc format.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, we introduced and began
shipments of two new products: DVDit!TM and DVD FusionTM. DVD it! is an
authoring application which provides simplified DVD authoring capabilities to
consumer, prosumer, and some professional users. DVD Fusion, which is a part
of our DVD Creator product line, provides video producers and editors a
comprehensive set of tools for encoding, authoring and proofing DVD-Video titles
derived from projects created on non-linear video editing systems.
Our products generally include application software and specialized
hardware installed on a personal computer. Our products are designed to improve
the productivity and effectiveness of media professionals, enabling them to
process and manipulate more material in a given amount of time and to achieve
results which would have been impossible using traditional linear analog or
digital technology.
b Use of Estimates and Certain Concentrations
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We are dependent on sole-source suppliers for certain key components used
in our products. We purchase these sole-source components pursuant to purchase
orders placed from time to time. We do not carry significant inventories of
these components, and have no guaranteed supply agreements. Any extended future
interruption or limitation in the supply of any of the components obtained from
a single source could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.
38   c Revenue Recognition
Revenue is derived from product sales and maintenance contracts. Revenue
from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the products. Revenue from
software maintenance, including maintenance sold with the product, is recognized
on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement, generally one year.
We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition. The statement provides specific industry
guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to
be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair
values of the elements, based on objective evidence which is specific to the
vendor. Our adoption of SOP 97-2 on April 1, 1998 did not have a material impact
on revenue recognition.
Revenue from sales to distributors and dealers may be subject to agreements
allowing limited rights of return and exchange. Accordingly, we provide reserves
for estimated future returns and exchanges at the time of the sale as a
reduction of revenue.
Cost of revenue includes hardware product costs, third party hardware
costs, amortization of capitalized software and third party software royalties.
d Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of short-term, highly-liquid investments with
original maturities of ninety days or less. Cash equivalents are generally
invested in money market funds.
e Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-
out basis, or market. Inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and
original equipment manufacturer goods.
f Fixed Assets
Fixed assets consist of furniture and equipment and are recorded at cost.
Equipment under capital leases is stated at the present value of minimum lease
payments at the inception of the lease. Depreciation of furniture and equipment
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets which are generally three to five years. Equipment held
under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the
estimated useful life of the asset.
g Purchased and Internally Developed Software Costs
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
86 Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed, purchased software and software product development costs
are capitalized when a product technological feasibility has been established
and then is amortized over a future period. Amortization begins when a product
is available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized
software costs, for both internally developed and purchased software products,
is computed on a straight- line basis over the estimated economic life of the
product, which is generally three years, or on a basis using the ratio of
current revenue to the total of current and anticipated
39 future revenue, whichever is greater. All other research and development
expenditures are charged to research and development expense in the period
incurred.
h Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of
accounting. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
i Basic and diluted loss per share
SFAS No. 128 Earnings Per Share requires the presentation of basic net
income per share, and for companies with complex capital structures, diluted net
income per share.
The following table sets forth the computations of shares and net loss per
share, applicable to common shareholders used in the calculation of basic and
diluted net loss per share for the years ended March 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in
thousands, except per share data                                          Years Ended March 31,

Basic and diluted net loss per share applicable to common
$ 076      021      056
As of March 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 potentially dilutive shares totaling
2,060,166; 1,834,502; and 1,253,947, respectively, for convertible preferred
stock and options with exercise prices less than the average market price that
could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, were not included in
earnings per share as their effect was anti-dilutive for those periods.
j Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject our company to
concentrations of credit risk are trade receivables. We manufacture and sell our
products to customers who are primarily audio and video and graphic arts
professionals who prepare sound, video and graphics for use in the music
recording, video, film and broadcast and printing industries or for corporate
in-house use and to dealers who support such customers. Management believes that
any risk of credit loss is significantly reduced due to the diversity of its end
users and their dispersion across many geographic sales areas. We maintain an
allowance for doubtful accounts to provide against potential credit losses.
40   k Stock-Based Compensation
Our company has various stock-based compensation plans, as discussed in
Note 7. We have accounted for the effect of our stock based compensation plans
under Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. We have elected to adopt only the disclosure based
requirements of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and as
such have disclosed the pro forma effects on net income loss and net income
loss per share data as if we had elected to use the fair value approach to
account for all our employee stock-based compensation plans.
l Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of
We account for long-lived assets, including intangibles, at amortized cost.
As part of our ongoing review of the valuation and amortization of long-lived
assets, we assess the carrying value of such assets if the facts and
circumstances suggest that they may be impaired. As a result, we have determined
that our long-lived assets are not impaired as of March 31, 2000 and 1999.
m Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
as amended by SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative instruments and hedging
activities. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2002. We do not anticipate that SFAS No. 133 will have a material
impact on our financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, as amended by SAB 101A, which provides guidance on the recognition,
presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the
SEC. SAB 101 outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue
and provides guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies.
We do not expect the adoption of SAB 101 to have a material effect on our
financial position or results of operations.
In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-2,
Accounting for Web Site Development Costs, which outlines the accounting
criteria for costs related to the development of web sites. We will be required
to adopt EITF Issue No. 00-2 in fiscal quarters beginning after June 30, 2000.
We are in the process of assessing any impact that the adoption of EITF Issue
No. 00-2 will have on our financial position or results of operations.
In March 2000, the EITF published their consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-3,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
to Arrangements that Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another
Entity Hardware. EITF Issue No. 00-3 outlines the accounting criteria for
hosting arrangements. We do not expect the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-3 to
have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting For Certain Transactions involving Stock
Compensation. FASB Interpretation No. 44 clarifies the application of APB
Opinion No. 25 for certain issues. The FASB Interpretation No. 44 is effective
July 1, 2000. We are in the process of assessing any impact that the adoption of
FASB Interpretation No. 44 will have on our financial statements.
41   n Comprehensive Income
SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure of
comprehensive income and its components which will be presented in association
with our company financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined as the
change in a business enterprise equity during a period arising from
transactions, events or circumstances relating to nonowner sources, such as
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities. It includes all changes in equity during a period
except those resulting from investments by or distributions to owners. For the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, net income and comprehensive
income were equivalent. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 130 had no impact
on our financial reporting.

6 CREDIT FACILITIES AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING
In December, 1996, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with
Silicon Valley Bank. This Agreement, which we sometimes refer to as our bank
credit line, has been modified or renewed at various times since December 1996.
The current bank credit line renewed in September, 1999 provides for up to
$2,500,000 in available borrowings based upon our eligible accounts receivable
balances. The current bank credit line will expire on September 28, 2000. This
bank credit line provides for a variety of covenants, including among other
things, that we maintain certain financial ratios. The bank credit line is
collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of our assets.
Interest on borrowings under this agreement is payable monthly at a rate of one
and one quarter percent in excess of the prime rate. On March 31, 2000, there
were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement.
Since December 1996, we have entered into a couple of different financing
arrangements with Hambrecht & Quist Guaranty Finance, including a $5,100,000
financing facility and a $7,000,000 equity-based line of credit. In March 1998 3,000,000 of the $5,100,000 financing facility was restructured into
43 1,500,000 of debt. The debt had an interest rate of 725% and was due in
October 1999. During the year ended march 31, 2000, 292,000 shares of the
convertible preferred stock were converted to common stock.
In October, 1999, we renegotiated our financing arrangement with Hambrecht
& Quist Guaranty Finance. The agreement we reached involved the restructuring of
$1,500,000 debt into 153,846 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and
$1,000,000 of debt. The interest rate on the restructured debt is 725% and the
debt and interest are payable in monthly installments through April 30, 2001. In
connection with this agreement, we issued warrants to purchase 120,000 common
shares at an exercise price of $250. These warrants expire on April 30, 2006.
We also enhanced the conversion rate of Hambrecht & Quist existing Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock so that each share of Series C Convertible Preferred
Stock is convertible into 1625 shares of Common Stock. The beneficial
conversion feature, warrants and new debt were recorded at their relative fair
values. We recorded $345,000 of deferred financing costs attributable to this
finance restructuring with Hambrecht & Quist Guaranty. This amount is being
amortized using the effective interest rate method to interest expense over the
term of the financing facility 18 months. The value of the warrants was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following
assumptions: volatility of 50, risk free interest rate of 6% and expected life
equal to the contractual terms. We filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement under
the Securities Act of 1933 to register the shares of the common stock which
underlie the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and the 120,000 shares of our
common stock which underlie the warrants issued to Hambrecht & Quist Guaranty
Finance.
In December, 1997, we secured a $7,000,000 equity-based line of credit.
Under this arrangement, we had the right to draw up to a total of $7,000,000 in
cash in exchange for common stock. Pricing of the common stock issued was based
on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw subject to a 14%
discount and a 4% commission payable in common stock. The availability of the
credit line, and the amounts and timing of draws under the line were subject to
a number of conditions. In January, 1998, we filed a Form S-3 Registration
Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 to register the resale of shares
issued under this credit line. Under this equity-based line of credit, we drew a
total of $3,808,000 and issued 1,522,000 shares of our common stock during
fiscal years 1998 and 1999. This facility is no longer available to us.
On May 20, 1999, we secured a new equity-based line of credit by entering
into a new stock purchase agreement with Kingsbridge. Under the new arrangement,
we were able to draw up to $12,000,000 in cash in exchange for common stock;
provided, however, that in any event we can not sell more than a total of
1,800,000 shares to Kingsbridge under this arrangement, unless we obtain
shareholder approval. Pricing of the common stock issued under this arrangement
is based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw,
discounted by 10% or 12%, depending upon the price of our common stock. The
availability of the credit line, and the amounts and timing of draws under the
line were subject to a number of conditions. On May 27, 1999, we filed a
Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register for resale the shares we may
issue to Kingsbridge under this credit line and on August 12, 1999 the Statement
became effective. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, we drew
$7,408,000 from the credit line for which we issued 1,800,000 shares of common
stock. Because of limitations on the total number of shares that can be issued
under this line of credit, this facility is no longer available to us and was
terminated on March 14, 2000.
7 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Convertible Preferred Stock
In October, 1999, we issued 153,846 shares of Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock to Hambrecht & Quist Guaranty Finance in conjunction with our
renegotiated financing arrangement with them. Also, in
44 conjunction with the new financing arrangement we changed the conversion rate of
all of our outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock so that each share
of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 1625 shares of
Common Stock.
Stock Options
Under our September 1989 Stock Option Plan the Plan, options to purchase
up to an aggregate of 2,090,000 shares of common stock may be granted to key
employees, directors and consultants. Grants of options to the directors of
Sonic Solutions may not exceed 140,000 shares. The Plan provides for issuing
both incentive stock options, which must be granted at fair market value at the
date of grant, and nonqualified stock options, which must be granted at not less
than 85% of fair market value of the stock. All options to date have been
granted as incentive stock options. Options under the Plan generally vest over
four years from the date of grant. The options generally expire ten years from
the date of grant and are canceled three months after termination of employment.
Our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer administer the Plan.
During 1995, we adopted the 1994 NonEmployee Directors Stock Option Plan
which provides for the grant of stock options to Sonic Solutions' nonemployee
directors. Under this plan, stock options are granted annually at the fair
market value of Sonic Solutions' common stock on the date of grant. The number
of options so granted annually is fixed by the plan. Such options generally vest
over four years from the grant date. The total number of shares to be issued
under this plan may not exceed 100,000 shares. There were 22,000 options
outstanding at March 31, 2000, at prices of $26560, $25625 and $16880 per
share, of which 8,020 were exercisable.
In March 1998, the Board of Directors approved the repricing of options at
an exercise price equal to fair market value on March 3, 1998 of $25625 per
share. There were no changes made to the vesting schedules in relation to the
repricing.
In July, 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the Sonic Solutions 1998
Stock Option Plan and the shareholder approved the 1998 Stock Option Plan in
September, 1998. The 1998 Stock Option Plan covers 1,000,000 shares of Common
Stock, with an annual increase in the number of shares available for issuance
under the Stock Option Plan on the last day of each fiscal year; provided that
the total number of shares issuable under the plan shall not exceed 2,000,000.

597%, 465% and 604%, respectively; expected life of 4 years; 91%, 91% and
97% expected volatility, respectively; and no dividends.
The effect of applying SFAS No. 123 for disclosing compensation costs may
not be representative of the effects on reported net income loss for future
years because pro forma net income loss reflects compensation costs only for
stock options granted in fiscal 1996 through 2000 and does not consider
compensation costs for stock options granted prior to April 1, 1995.

The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended March 31, 1999
and 2000 was an increase of approximately $966,000 and $2,343,000, respectively.
Management believes that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future
realization of certain deferred tax assets and, that a valuation allowance is
required.
As of March 31, 2000, we have cumulative federal and California net
operating losses of approximately $16,483,000 and $7,263,000, respectively,
which can be used to offset future income subject to taxes. The federal tax loss
carryforwards will expire beginning in the year 2012 through 2020. The
California tax loss carryforwards will expire beginning in the year 2001 through
2005.
As of March 31, 2000, we have cumulative unused research and development
tax credits of approximately $1,747,000 and $858,000 which can be used to reduce
future federal and California income taxes, respectively. Federal credit
carryforwards expire from 2009 through 2020; California credits will
carryforward indefinitely.
As of March 31, 2000, we have federal minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $135,000 which will carry forward indefinitely until utilized.
9 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
a Leases
In December, 1996, we entered into a leasing agreement to finance the
purchase of up to $1,000,000 in equipment, as discussed in Note 6. Lease terms
under the agreement are for 42 months and are secured by the leased equipment.
We also lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating
leases.

10 SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND SEGMENT REPORTING
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which was
adopted by us in 1998. SFAS No. 131 requires companies to report financial and
descriptive information about its reportable operating segments, including
segment profit or loss, certain specific revenue and expense items and segment
assets, as well as information about the revenues derived from our products and
services, the countries in which we earn revenue and hold assets, and major
customers. The method for determining what information to report is based on the
way that management organized the operating segments within our company for
making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Our chief operating decision maker is considered to be our Chief Executive
Officer CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on a
consolidated basis accompanied by desegregated information about revenue by
product line and revenue by geographic region for purposes of making operating
decisions and assessing financial performance. The consolidated financial
information reviewed by the CEO is identical to the information presented in the
accompanying statement of operations. Therefore, we operate in, and measure our
results in a single operating segment. As such, we are required to disclose the
following revenue by product line, revenue by geographic and significant
customer information                    49   Revenues by Product Line                                         Years Ended March 31,

Our accounting system does not capture meaningful gross margin and
operating income loss information by product line, nor is such information
used by the CEO for purposes of making operating decisions. Accordingly, such
information has not been disclosed.

On May 4, 2000, we secured a new equity-based line of credit by entering
into a new Private Equity Line Agreement with Kingsbridge. Under the new
agreement, we may draw up to $20,000,000 in cash in exchange for up to 199% of
our common stock. Pricing of the common stock issued under this agreement is
based on the market price of our common stock at the time of a draw subject to
discounts ranging from 8% to 12%. Borrowings from this credit facility are
subject to the completion of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register
for resale the shares we may issue to Kingsbridge under this equity-based line
of credit.
