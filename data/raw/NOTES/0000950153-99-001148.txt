INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
Board of Directors
SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries as of May 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended May 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries as of May 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended May 31, 1999 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MAY 31, 1999 AND 1998
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA
1 MERGER
In April 1999, SpeedFam International, Inc. SpeedFam issued 13,048 shares
of its common stock in exchange for all outstanding common and preferred stock
of Integrated Process Equipment Corp. IPEC. In conjunction with this merger,
SpeedFam amended its articles of incorporation to change the corporate name of
SpeedFam to SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. SpeedFam-IPEC or the Company.
Effective upon the consummation of the merger, each share of the
outstanding common stock of IPEC was converted into 71 shares of common stock
of the Company. Outstanding IPEC employee stock options, warrants and
convertible notes were similarly converted into options, warrants and
convertible notes to purchase Company stock. In addition, each share of the
Series B-1 preferred stock, Series B-2 preferred stock, and Series B-3 preferred
stock of IPEC has been converted into 890, 810, and 1065 shares of common
stock of the Company, respectively.
The merger constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been treated as a
pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of IPEC were
carried forward to the Company at historical values and the consolidated
financial statements for the periods prior to the combination have been restated
to include the accounts and results of operations of IPEC.
The results of operations previously reported by the separate enterprises
and the combined amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are summarized below                                     YEARS ENDED
TEN MONTHS ENDED                         MARCH 31, 1999   MAY 31, 1998  MAY 31, 1997

$ 97,270     185,256     173,424

38,105     42,503    34,030
$46,630     29,640    13,811
Prior to the combination, IPEC fiscal year ended June 30. In recording
the pooling-of-interests combination, IPEC financial statements for the twelve
months ended May 31, 1999 were combined with SpeedFam financial statements for
the same period and IPEC financial statements for the years ended June 30,
1998 and 1997 were combined with SpeedFam financial statements for the years
ended May 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. IPEC unaudited results of
operations for the one month ended June 30, 1998 included revenue of $19,727 and
net income of $2,232. An adjustment has been made to stockholders' equity as of
May 31, 1999 to eliminate the effect of including IPEC results of operations
for the one month ended June 30, 1998 in the results of operations of the
combined enterprise for both of the years ended May 31, 1999 and 1998. There
were no significant transactions between SpeedFam and IPEC prior to the
combination or significant differences in accounting policies that required
elimination or adjustment in the combined financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc., an Illinois corporation, designs, develops,
manufactures, markets, and supports chemical mechanical planarization CMP
systems used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices and other
high-throughput, precision surface processing systems. SpeedFam-IPEC flat
surface processing systems are used in the thin film memory disk media, silicon
wafer, and general industrial applications markets.
The Company also markets and distributes polishing liquids slurries,
parts, and consumables used in its customers' manufacturing processes.
SpeedFam-IPEC, Inc. owns a 50 percent interest in each of two joint ventures,
SpeedFam-IPEC Co., Ltd. the Far East Joint Venture and Fujimi Corporation.
a Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all
significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
The Company investments in the common stock of affiliates SpeedFam-IPEC
Co., Ltd. a Japanese corporation, 50% owned and Fujimi Corporation an
Illinois corporation, 50% owned are accounted for by the equity method using
fiscal years that end April 30 and May 31, respectively.
b Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase.
The Company short-term investments consist of government and corporate
debt securities. All of the Company short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of related tax effect, on
available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a
separate component of other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains
and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined on a
specific identification basis.
A decline in market value of any available-for-sale security below cost
that is deemed to be other than temporary is considered an impairment of fair
value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the
security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over
the life of the related available-for-sale security as an adjustment to yield
using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized
when earned.
c Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
market.
d Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation expense was $19,102, $12,436, and $8,952 in fiscal years 1999,
1998, and 1997, respectively. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as
follows

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Equipment recorded under capital leases is stated at the lower of fair
market value or the present value of minimum lease payments at the inception of
the lease. Equipment recorded under capital leases and leasehold improvements
are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term
or the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
e Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
f Revenue Recognition
Sales of the Company products are recorded upon customer acceptance, or
shipment if no customer acceptance is required, at which time title passes to
the customer. Customer acceptance refers to the sign off by the customer that
the equipment is complete and has passed all tests satisfactory to the customer.
Installation of the equipment is generally completed within 30 to 60 days of
acceptance. Service revenue is recognized upon completion of the service.
g Installation and Warranty Costs
Costs to be incurred by the Company related to product installation and
warranty fulfillment are accrued at the date of customer acceptance, or shipment
if no customer acceptance is required, and are estimated by the Company based on
past experience.
h Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency is the functional currency for all foreign operations.
Accordingly, translation gains or losses related to the foreign subsidiaries
financial statements are included as a component of stockholders' equity.
i Earnings Loss Per Share
Basic earnings loss per common share is based upon the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings loss per common share
assumes the exercise of all options which are dilutive, whether exercisable or
not. The dilutive effect of stock options is measured under the treasury stock
method.
The weighted average shares used to calculate basic and diluted earnings
per common share for the years ended May 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997 are as
follows                               1999   1998   1997

In calculating net loss per common share for 1999 and 1998, 375,000 and
1,600 potentially dilutive common shares consisting of stock options, warrants,
convertible notes and convertible preferred stock have been excluded because
their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

The Company sells products and services primarily to semiconductor
manufacturers, and extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer
financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. As a result of the
economic difficulties within certain Asian countries, the Company has increased
sales subject to extended payment terms within this region. Exposure to losses
on receivables is principally dependent on each customer financial condition.
The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for
anticipated losses.

k Patents, Trademarks, and Goodwill
Patents and trademarks included in other assets, in the net amount of
$6,336 and $6,452 at the end of fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively, are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 5 to 17 years for patents and five years
for trademarks.
Intangible assets have been allocated among various categories based on
their estimated fair value upon acquisition as determined by management or by
independent appraisal.
Goodwill included in other assets, in the net amount of $3,274 and $3,981
at the end of fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively, represents the excess
cost over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and is
amortized over 10 years using the straight-line method.

l Research, Development, and Engineering
Expenditures for research, development, and engineering of products and
processes are expensed as incurred.
m Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Company management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
n Employee Stock Plans
Effective June 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financing
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
option and stock purchase plans and, accordingly, does not recognize
compensation cost. As prescribed by SFAS No. 123, note 17 contains a summary of
the pro forma effects on reported net income and earnings per share for 1999,
1998, and 1997 as if the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost
based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant date.
o Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred that indicate the estimated useful life of long-lived assets or
intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be
recoverable. When factors indicate that the asset should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted
net cash flows generated by the asset over the remaining estimated life of the
asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. Material factors which may
alter the useful life of the asset or lead to a determination that the balance
may not be recoverable include effects of new technologies, obsolescence,
demand, competition, and other economic factors. If such assets are considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell.
p Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to
market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates. Derivative
financial instruments currently utilized by the Company primarily include
foreign currency forward contracts. The Company evaluates and monitors
consolidated net exposures by currency and maturity, and external derivative
financial instruments correlate with the net exposures in all material respects.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets and liabilities are included in
the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately
recognized in income when the related assets and liabilities are sold or
liquidated. Gains or losses related to hedges of firm commitments are deferred
and included in the bases of the transactions when they are completed. Gains or
losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions, if any, are included in income
as part of cost of sales. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments
which protect the Company from exposure in a particular currency, but do not
currently have a designated underlying transaction, are also included in income
as part of cost of sales. If a hedged item matures, or is sold, extinguished,
terminated, or is related to an anticipated transaction that is no longer likely

to take place, the derivative financial instrument is closed and the related
gain or loss is included in income as part of cost of sales.
q Comprehensive Income
Effective June 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which established
standards to report and display comprehensive income and its components in a
full set of general purpose financial statements.
r Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997
financial statements to conform to the fiscal 1999 presentation.
3 MERGER, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS
In connection with the merger, the Company recorded various merger,
integration and restructuring costs. Direct merger costs primarily consist of
professional fees, such as investment banking, legal and accounting for services
rendered through the date of the merger. The Company recorded integration and
restructuring costs for lease terminations, the write-off of duplicative
equipment previously used for demonstration purposes, the writedown of inventory
and equipment related to product lines that will no longer be supported, and
severence costs resulting from workforce reductions.
The merger of the two companies resulted in the closing of several
facilities, the most significant being the former IPEC corporate office and two
manufacturing facilities. The IPEC corporate office and one of the manufacturing
facilities were vacated as of May 31, 1999. The other manufacturing facility
will be vacated in fiscal year 2000. As a result, the Company has accrued lease
termination costs for the estimated payments required to be made subsequent to
vacating the facilities and has written off leasehold improvements made at these
facilities.
As part of the business strategy developed by the combined entity, certain
product lines will no longer be supported. These product lines relate to wafer
shaping and measuring applications, and the 372 CMP product line formerly
produced by IPEC. Certain equipment and inventory associated with these product
lines have been written down to estimated market value. Market value has been
determined based on estimated liquidation value. The disposals are expected to
occur in fiscal year 2000.
The severance and other related employee costs provide for the reduction of
approximately 90 employment positions resulting from facility closures, and the
elimination of duplicate positions or positions no longer necessary due to the
streamlining of operations. Notification of the planned severance and the amount
of the related benefits was made to employees prior to May 31, 1999.
The following table summarizes the components of the merger, integration,
and restructuring costs.                                FISCAL 1999 ACTIVITY

are expected to be $12,800 for fiscal year 2000.
4 SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
In August, 1998 the Company recorded a realized gain of $46 from the sale
of tax exempt short-term investments, classified as held-to-maturity securities,
with a carrying value of $35,803. The proceeds of $35,849 were re-invested. The
Company sold investments originally intended to be held-to-maturity to take
advantage of more favorable rates of return available on taxable securities. All
of the Company short-term investments were reclassified as available-for-sale
subsequent to the date of sale and are recorded at fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The Company has in excess of $100,000 of Federal net operating loss
carryforwards at May 31, 1999 which expire between 2000 and 2019. The Company
also has $5,000 of Federal research and development tax credit carryforwards
available. These carryforwards begin to expire in 2011.
The valuation allowance for deferred taxes was increased by $51,500 and
$32,200 during the years ended May 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. A valuation
allowance is required to be recorded against deferred tax assets that are not
likely to be realized. This determination is dependent on many factors,
including the Company ability to generate taxable income within the net
operating loss carryforward period. Significant negative results of the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 1999, including a decline in sales and backlog, were due
to the downturn in the semiconductor industry, Asian economic situation, and
market share erosion due to increased competition in the sales of CMP systems to
semi-conductor manufacturers. The industry instability changed the assumptions
used to predict future projected results of the Company. These circumstances
combined with two consecutive years of operating losses as of May 31, 1999
caused a change in judgment about the realization of the deferred tax assets. As
a result, the Company is unable to predict the level of future sales and ability
to generate income under these circumstances. The Company has established a full
valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets. The Company will
recognize future benefits only as reassessment demonstrates that the deferred
tax assets are realizable. While the need for this valuation allowance is
subject to periodic review, if the allowance is reduced, the tax benefits
attributable to the deferred tax assets will be recorded in the future as a
reduction of the Company income tax expense.
A reconciliation between the Company effective tax rate and the expected
tax rate on earnings before income taxes is as follows                                1999  1998  1997

No provision is made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of wholly
owned non-U.S. subsidiaries and SpeedFam-IPEC Co., Ltd., because it is the
Company present intention to reinvest substantially all the earnings of these
operations. At the end of fiscal year 1999, there was approximately $27,102 of
accumulated undistributed earnings of those operations. It is not practical for
the Company to compute the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the
undistributed earnings.
10 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In the second quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company announced its decision to
focus its resources on manufacturing CMP and CMP related equipment. As a result
of this decision, the Company adopted a plan for the disposition by sale or
closure of IPEC Clean in calendar 1997.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
IPEC Clean has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and,
accordingly, its results of operations and financial position are segregated for
all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Revenue, related losses, and income taxes associated with the discontinued
operations are as follows                                FISCAL

$ 4,609
Loss from discontinued operations before taxes.  5,495
Income tax   1,881
Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes. $3,614
The effective income tax benefit for discontinued operations differs from
the Company effective tax rate primarily as a result of nondeductible
amortization of intangible assets.
The Company recorded a pretax charge of $27,200 to write down intangible
assets, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and other assets to estimated
net realizable value and to record additional liabilities in the second quarter
of fiscal 1997. A charge of $2,945 was also recorded to reflect the estimated
phase out costs and losses from operations associated with IPEC Clean until
disposition. The tax benefit associated with these charges was $5,195.
Following the decision to dispose of IPEC Clean in calendar 1997, the
Company entered into negotiations to sell its remaining assets. The
deteriorating business climate in the Pacific Rim resulted in customers delaying
expected purchases from IPEC Clean and the Company was unable to consummate a
sale. The Company closed IPEC Clean in the third quarter of fiscal 1998. A
charge of $10,578 to write down accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and
other assets to liquidation value and to record additional liabilities was
recorded in fiscal 1998.
11 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

Forward exchange contracts to buy foreign currency. $1,862  2,833
Forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currency. $4,390  1,637
All currency forward contracts outstanding at May 31, 1999 have maturities
of less than one year and are primarily to buy or sell Japanese yen in exchange
for U.S. dollars. Management believes that these contracts should not subject
the Company to undue risk from foreign exchange movements, because gains and
losses on these contracts generally offset gains and losses on the assets,
liabilities, and transactions being hedged.
16 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
The Company maintains defined-contribution savings and profit-sharing plans
for its employees. The plans cover certain employees who meet length of service
requirements. Expenses under the plans, determined by the Company Board of

repricing of options granted after January 20, 1995, and prior to August 16,
1996, with an exercise price exceeding $1955 per share. Employees, officers and
directors holding options granted with an exercise price exceeding $1955 per
share, who were active in their respective positions on August 15, 1996, could
elect to keep their options to buy common stock at the original grant price or
reprice their options to $1955 per share, the fair market value of the common
stock on August 16, 1996. If the option holder elected to reprice the options to
$1955 per share, the vesting commencement date was extended by periods ranging
from one to thirteen months. Options for 1,581 shares were repriced.
As permitted under SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to follow APB No.
25 in accounting for stock-based awards to employees. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option and stock purchase
plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option and stock purchase
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent with
the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and loss per share would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below                            1999     1998    1997

In calculating pro forma compensation, the fair value of each option is

with the following weighted average assumptions for grants made in fiscal years
1999, 1998, and 1997.

20 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments at May 31, 1999 and 1998 include cash
equivalents, short-term investments, trade receivables, trade payables, foreign
exchange contracts, and long-term debt. The carrying value of cash equivalents,
short-term investments, trade receivables, and trade payables approximates fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. Fair values relating
to foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes reflect the estimated
net amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at
the reporting date based on quoted market prices of comparable contracts and are
not material at May 31, 1999 and 1998. The fair value of the Company long-term
debt is not materially different from its financial statement carrying value.
The fair value of the Company long-term debt is estimated based on current
rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.
21 OTHER INCOME EXPENSE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --CONTINUED
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks and highly liquid
short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. These
highly liquid short-term investments are carried at cost which approximates
market.
d Investments
The Company classifies its investments in debt and equity securities into
one of three categories: trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity.
Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling
them in the near term. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities in which
the Company has the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. All
other securities not included in trading or held-to-maturity are classified as
available-for-sale.
Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the
amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. Unrealized holding gains and
losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are
excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of
available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity
security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a
reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to
earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and
discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related
held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest
method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
e Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
on the declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation expense was $5,014, $5,256 and $3,542 in fiscal years 1999, 1998,
and 1997, respectively. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows                              
Buildings and  3 to 60 years
Machinery and  3 to 13 years
Furniture and  2 to 20 years
Leasehold     2 years
f Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the
first-in, first-out FIFO method, or market.
g Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under
the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

h Revenue Recognition
Sales of the Company products are recorded upon shipment.
i Warranty Costs
Generally, the Company provides a one-year warranty against manufacturer
defects on all machines sold. Provision for warranty expense is provided based
upon an estimate derived from historical experience factors.
j Foreign Currency Translation
The local currency is the functional currency for all non-Japan operations.
Accordingly, translation gains or losses related to the non-Japan subsidiary
financial statements are included as a component of stockholders' equity.
k Significant Customer
The Company had sales to a Japanese company that amounted to approximately
103%, 203%, and 125% of net sales in fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997,
respectively.
l Research and Development
Research and development expense amounted to approximately $7,379, $7,481,
and $11,488 in fiscal years 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Such
expenditures are expensed as incurred.
m Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Company management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
n Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the fiscal year 1998 and 1997 financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the fiscal year 1999 financial statement
presentation.
o Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred that indicate the estimated useful life of long-lived assets or
intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be
recoverable. When factors indicate that the asset should be evaluated for
possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted
net cash flows generated by the asset over the remaining estimated life of the
asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. Material factors which may
alter the useful life of the asset or lead to a determination that the balance
may not be recoverable include effects of new technologies, obsolescence,
demand, competition, and other economic factors. If such assets are considered
to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell.

The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $1,404 and $378 for deferred
tax assets at the end of fiscal years 1999 and 1998. Net deferred tax assets are
considered realizable due to the expectation of future taxable income. Deferred
income taxes included as a component of stockholders' equity related to
unrealized gains on marketable securities aggregated $141 and $33 at the end of
fiscal years 1999 and 1998, respectively.
At April 30, 1999, certain subsidiaries have net operating loss
carryforwards for income tax purposes of $3,919 which are available to offset
future taxable income, if any, through fiscal year 2003.
Amendments to Japanese tax regulations were enacted into law on March 24,
1999 and March 31, 1998. As a result of these amendments, the normal income tax
rate was reduced from approximately 47% to 42% effective for the Company
fiscal year 2000 and approximately 51% to 47% effective for the Company fiscal
year 1999. Current income taxes were calculated at the rate of 47% and 51% in
effect for the years ended April 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Deferred
income taxes were calculated at the rate of 42% and 47% for the years ended
April 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
A reconciliation between the Company effective tax rate and the expected
tax rate of 47% in 1999 and 51% in 1998 and 1997 in Japan on earnings before
income taxes and minority interest is as follows                                1999  1998  1997

Effective June 1, 1984 the Company adopted an insured pension plan which
also covers employees of SpeedFam Clean Systems Co., Ltd., the terms of which
provide for the ultimate funding of retirement benefits when due. Premiums paid
under the insured plan constitute the funding of the current costs of the
liability under the plan and the funding of the related past service costs over
a 15-year period.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132,
Employees' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SFAS
132 in fiscal year 1999. SFAS 132 revises employers' disclosures about pensions
and other postretirement benefits and does not change the recognition or
measurement of the Plan. SFAS 132 does not have an effect on the Company
consolidated financial position and results of operations. All prior year
disclosures have been restated to conform with the provisions of SFAS 132.

The measurement date of the benefit obligations and the plan assets has
been changed from April 30 to January 31. The period of calculation in fiscal
year 1999 was for the nine months ended January 31, 1999. The effect of the
change of the measurement date is immaterial.
Plan assets represent the Company shares of funds invested by a trustee
in pooled accounts comprised of cash in banks, securities, and real estate.
A separate retirement benefits program for directors and statutory auditors
is not covered by the pension plan described above. The program provides that
directors and statutory auditors who retire or sever their connection with the
Company are entitled to lump-sum payments based on current rates of pay,
determined according to their title and the length of service. Directors and
statutory auditors may also be granted, at the discretion of the Company,
additional lump-sum payments for meritorious service. It is not the policy of
the Company to fund these retirement and severance benefits, but provision has
been made in the financial statements for the estimated accrued liabilities
under the plan. The liability related to these retirement benefits included in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal years 1999 and
1998 amounted to $5,794 and $4,905, respectively. The plan was amended during
fiscal year 1996 and the resulting past service costs of $1,008 are being
amortized over a period of five years. Unamortized past service cost at the end
of fiscal years 1999 and 1998 amounting to $194 and $349, respectively, is
classified as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
retirement benefit expenses amounted to $495, $1,492, and $1,545 in fiscal years
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively.
Two subsidiaries of the Company have separate employee retirement and
severance plan arrangements. Payments with respect to voluntary severance are
less in amount than payments for involuntary severance and retirement. The
subsidiaries have recorded estimated liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal years 1999 and 1998 of $326 and
$221, respectively, based upon the amount, net of the benefits to be paid by a
government-sponsored small enterprise mutual aid retirement fund, which would be
payable if all employees had to retire voluntarily. Plan assets plus the accrued
liability approximate vested benefits. The expense related to these employee
retirement and severance plans amounted to $143, $28, and $67 in fiscal years
1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The Company believes that the effect of not
adopting SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, for these plans is
not material to the consolidated financial statements.

11 LEGAL RESERVE AND CASH DIVIDENDS
The Japanese Commercial Code provides that earnings in an amount equal to
at least 10% of retained earnings be appropriated as a legal reserve, until such
reserve equals 25% of stated common stock. This legal reserve is not available
for dividends but may be used to reduce a deficit or may be transferred to
stated common stock. Certain non-Japanese subsidiaries are also required to
appropriate their earnings to legal reserves under the laws of the respective
countries in which they operate. The legal reserve included as a component of
retained earnings at the end of fiscal years 1999 and 1998 amounted to $1,453

The Company financial instruments at April 30, 1999 and 1998 include cash
equivalents, trade receivables, short-term investments, short-term borrowings,
trade payables, noncurrent receivables and long-term debt. The carrying amount
of cash equivalents, trade receivables, short-term borrowings, and trade
payables approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. The fair value of short-term investments has been determined based
on quoted market prices and approximates their financial statement carrying
values. The fair value of the Company noncurrent receivables and long-term
debt has been determined based on discounted cash flows using current interest
rates of similar instruments, and is not materially different from their
carrying values.
