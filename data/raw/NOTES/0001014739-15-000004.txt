AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 1-- NATURE OF BUSINESSCorporate Organization and BusinessBioScrip, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company or BioScrip is a national provider of infusion and home care management solutions that partners with physicians, hospital systems, skilled nursing facilities, healthcare payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide patients access to post-acute care services. The Company operates with a commitment to bring customer-focused pharmacy and related healthcare infusion therapy services into the home or alternate-site setting. By collaborating with the full spectrum of healthcare professionals and the patient, the Company aims to provide cost-effective care that is driven by clinical excellence, customer service and values that promote positive outcomes and an enhanced quality of life for those whom we serve.The Companys platform provides nationwide service capabilities and the ability to deliver clinical management services that offer patients a high-touch, community-based and home-based care environment. The Companys core services are provided in coordination with, and under the direction of, the patients physician. The Company multidisciplinary team of clinicians, including pharmacists, nurses, dieticians and respiratory therapists, work with the physician to develop a plan of care suited to the patients specific needs. Whether in the home, physician office, ambulatory infusion center, skilled nursing facility or other alternate sites of care, the Company provides products, services and condition-specific clinical management programs tailored to improve the care of individuals with complex health conditions such as gastrointestinal abnormalities, infectious diseases, cancer, multiple sclerosis, organ and blood cell transplants, bleeding disorders, immune deficiencies and heart failure.On March 31, 2014, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of its Home Health Services segment to LHC Group, Inc. see Note 5 - Discontinued Operations. As a result of the sale of the Home Health Services segment, the Company has twooperating and reportable segments, Infusion Services and PBM Services. These operating and reportable segments reflect how the Company chief operating decision maker reviews the Companys results in terms of allocating resources and assessing performance.Basis of PresentationThe Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles GAAP.ReclassificationsWith the sale of the Home Health Services segment on March 31, 2014, all prior period financial statements have been reclassified to include the Home Health Services segment as discontinued operations. In addition, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications had no material effect on our previously reported Consolidated Financial Statements.NOTE 2-- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESConsolidationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates62Table of ContentsFair Value MeasurementsThe fair value measurement accounting standard, ASC Topic 820, Fair Value MeasurementASC 820, provides a framework for measuring fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The standard establishes a valuation hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on independent market data sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Companys assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available. The valuation hierarchy is composed of three categories. The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The categories within the valuation hierarchy are described as follows:Level 1 - Inputs to the fair value measurement are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 - Inputs to the fair value measurement include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.Level 3 - Inputs to the fair value measurement are unobservable inputs or valuation techniques.Cash and Cash EquivalentsHighly liquid investments with a maturity of threemonths or less when purchased are classified as cash  include amounts due from government sources, such as Medicare and Medicaid programs, PBMs, Managed Care Organizations and other commercial insurance Plan Sponsors; amounts due from patient co-payments; amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates; and service fees resulting from the distribution of certain drugs through retail pharmacies.Allowance for Doubtful AccountsThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on estimates of losses related to receivable balances. The risk of collection varies based upon the product, the payor commercial health insurance and government and the patients ability to pay the amounts not reimbursed by the payor.We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on several factors including the age of the outstanding receivables, the historical experience of collections, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in some cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for the ability to pay. Collection agencies are employed and legal action is taken when we determine that taking collection actions is reasonable relative to the probability of receiving payment on amounts owed.Management judgment is used to assess the collectability of accounts and the ability of our customers to pay.Judgment is also used to assess trends in collections and the effects of systems and business process changes on our expected collection rates. The Company reviews the estimation process quarterly and makes changes to the estimates as necessary. When it is determined that a customer account is uncollectible, that balance is written off against the existing allowance.Change in Estimate of the Collectability of Accounts ReceivableDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company experienced deterioration in the aging of certain accounts receivable primarily due to delays and disruptions related to the integration of its acquisitions in 2013. The disruption to billing and collection processes was attributable in part to the following:Re-licensure and new managed care credentialing was required in connection with the CarePoint Business;Medicare claims were not filed until retraining and review of eligibility was performed;Merged facilities and work teams in sevenlarge markets and related employee turnover;Conversion to a single version of our dispensing and billing system while still managing accounts receivable run-off on fiveother legacy versions; andCash posting challenges that delayed secondary and patient billings and patient statement issuance.The Company outsourced collections to third party agency partners and hired and trained billing and collection personnel to mitigate the effects of the disruption; however, the Company has experienced more difficulty collecting the aged balances than it 63Table of Contentsoriginally estimated. While the Company provided incremental allowances during each of the first two quarters of 2014 to address the developing deterioration, during the third quarter, the Company materially changed its estimates based on actual collection experience during and after the acquisition disruption period. The Company also recorded adjustments to reserves in the fourth quarter of approximately $317 millionconsisting of $323 millionto its allowance for bad debts partially offset by a favorable adjustment of $06 millionto its contractual adjustment reserves due to the deterioration of the Infusion Services segment accounts receivable aging. The reserves as of December31, 2014represent a 100%reserve on all amounts over one year and 80%of receivables outstanding in the nine to twelve month age category. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the incremental adjustments are approximately $604 millionconsisting of $554 millionto the allowance for doubtful accounts and $50 millionof contractual adjustment reserves.The following table sets forth the aging of our net accounts receivable net of allowance for contractual adjustments and prior to allowance for doubtful accounts, aged based on date of service and categorized based on the threeprimary overall types of accounts receivable characteristics in thousands:December31, 2014December31, 20130 - 180 daysOver 180 daysTotal0 - 180 daysOver 180  accounts  for doubtful accounts66,50017,836Net accounts  for Contractual DiscountsThe Company is reimbursed by payors for products and services the Company provides. Payments for medications and services covered by payors average less than billed charges.The Company monitors revenue and receivables from payors for each of our branches and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain revenue and receivable balances as of the revenue recognition date to properly account for anticipated differences between amounts estimated in our billing system and amounts reimbursed.Accordingly, the total revenue and receivables reported in our financial statements are recorded at the amounts expected to be received from these payors. For the significant portion of the Companys revenue, the contractual allowance is estimated based on several criteria, including unbilled claims, historical trends based on actual claims paid, current contract and reimbursement terms and changes in customer base and payor/product mix. Contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled. We do not believe these changes in estimates are material. The billing functions for the remaining portion of the Companys revenue are largely computerized, which enableson-line adjudication i.e., submitting charges to third-party payors electronically with simultaneous feedback of the amount the primary insurance planexpects to pay at the time of sale to record net revenue, exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited on this portion of the business.InventoryInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory consists principally of purchased prescription drugs and related supplies. Included in inventory is a reserve for inventory waste and obsolescence.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets as follows:AssetUseful LifeComputer hardware and software3years-5yearsOffice   and fixtures5years64Table of ContentsLeasehold improvements and assets leased under capital leases are depreciated using a straight-line basis over the related lease term or estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is less.The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or retired are removed from the accounts with the gain or loss, if applicable, recorded in the statement of operations.Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.Costs relating to the development of software for internal purposes are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and OtherASC 350. Thereafter, the remaining software production costs up to the date placed into production are capitalized and included in Property and Equipment.Costs of customization and implementation of computer software purchased for internal use are likewise capitalized. Depreciation of the capitalized amounts commences on the date the asset is ready for its intended use and is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software.GoodwillGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350.Impairment testing is performed for each of our operating and reporting segments. The impairment testing is based on a two-step process.The first step compares the fair value of a reporting segment to its carrying amount including goodwill.If the first step indicates that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill. The measurement of possible impairment is based on the comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value.Intangible AssetsThe Company evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.Impairment of Long Lived AssetsThe Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets, including intangible assets, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable. The measurement of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based on the fair value of the asset, calculated as the present value of related cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business.Variable Interest EntityThe Company previously had an affiliate equity investment in a variable interest entity that developed a platform that facilitates the flow, management and sharing of vital health and medical information with stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem. On April 19, 2013, the Company, along with all other minority investors, completed the sale of its affiliate equity investment in this variable interest entity. At closing, the Company received cash payments from the sale of $85 million, with an additional $11 millionheld in escrow pending any working capital adjustments that may be necessary. As of December31, 2014, all amounts held in escrow have been received by the Company. The Company also expects to receive additional services or cash from an existing guarantee during the twoyears following close.The terms of the services to be provided or the cash guarantee to be paid will be determined by the Company and the parties involved in the sale. As of December31, 2014, a receivable of $24 millionis included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.Amounts due to Plan SponsorsAmounts due to Plan Sponsors primarily represent payments received from Plan Sponsors in excess of the contractually required reimbursement.These amounts are refunded to Plan Sponsors. These payables also include the sharing of manufacturers rebates with Plan Sponsors.Contingent ConsiderationLiabilities that may be owed to sellers after the closing of an acquisition transaction are recorded at fair value as of the opening balance sheet established for the acquired target. These contingent consideration provisions are frequently referred to as earnouts 65Table of Contentsand are the subject of negotiation between the seller and the buyer. An earnout provision can compensate the seller with the value they believe the asset will deliver while also providing downside risk protection to the buyer should projections not materialize. As such, the terms of potential earnouts vary with each transaction. Fair value is assigned using multiple payout scenarios which each have a probability assigned based on factors including actual performance, evidence of business plans that have been implemented, and current market conditions that influence the ability to achieve the earnout. The probable payout amount is discounted to the current balance sheet date using a risk free rate. Each quarter, the fair value of the contingent consideration is updated to reflect relevant factors such as post-closing operating results and future forecasts for the acquired business or entity. The fair value of contingent consideration may be included in current liabilities or other non-current liabilities depending on the payment date specified in the purchase agreement.Revenue RecognitionThe Company generates revenue principally through the provision of home infusion and other home healthcare services to provide clinical management services and the delivery of cost effective prescription medications.Prescription drugs are dispensed through pharmacies owned by the Company.Prescription drugs are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in the Companys pharmacy network or a pharmacy owned by the Company.Fee-for-service agreements include: ipharmacy agreements, where we dispense prescription medications through the Companys pharmacy facilities and iiPBM agreements, where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies participating in the Companys retail pharmacy network.FASB ASC Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Element ArrangementsASC 605-25, addresses situations in which there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement with a customer and provides guidance in determining whether multiple deliverables should be recognized separately or in combination.The Company provides a variety of therapies to patients.For infusion-related therapies, the Company frequently provides multiple deliverables of drugs and related nursing services.After applying the criteria from ASC 605-25, the Company concluded that separate units of accounting exist in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.Drug revenue is recognized at the time the drug is shipped, and nursing revenue is recognized on the date of service. The Company allocates revenue consideration based on the relative fair value as determined by the Companys best estimate of selling price to separate the revenue where there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement.Revenue generated under PBM agreements is classified as either gross or net based on whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through our retail pharmacy network. When the Company independently has a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy provider for benefits provided to its Plan Sponsors members, and therefore is the primary obligor as defined in FASB ASC 605, Revenue RecognitionASC 605 the Company includes payments which include the drug ingredient cost from these Plan Sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost of revenue. These transactions require the Company to pay network pharmacy providers, assume credit risk of Plan Sponsors and act as a principal. If the Company merely acts as an agent, and consequently administers Plan Sponsors network pharmacy contracts, the Company does not have the primary obligation to pay the network pharmacy and assume credit risk, and as such, records only the administrative fees and not the drug ingredient cost as revenue.Revenue generated under discount card agreements is recognized when the discount card is used to purchase a prescription drug. The revenue is based on contractual rates per transaction. Broker fees associated with the marketing of the discount cards are incurred and recognized at the time the card is used and classified as selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.In the Companys Infusion Services segment, the Company also recognizes nursing revenue as the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and Plan Sponsors for services rendered and products provided.This revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and is recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement or payment arrangements with payors.Under the Medicare Prospective Payment System program, net revenue is recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patients condition, service needs and certain other factors.Revenue is recognized ratably over a 60-day episode period and is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patients condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same 60-day episodic period.Medicare cash receipts under the prospective payment system are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently recognized as revenue over the 60-day episode period.The process for recognizing revenue under the Medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments, the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification, and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits, have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode66Table of ContentsCost of RevenueCost of revenue includes the costs of prescription medications, pharmacy claims, fees paid to pharmacies, shipping and other direct and indirect costs associated with pharmacy management and administration, claims processing operations, and nursing services, offset by volume and prompt pay discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors and total manufacturer rebates.RebatesManufacturers rebates are part of each of the Companys segments.Rebates are generally volume-based incentives that are earned and recorded upon purchase of the inventory.Rebates are recorded as a reduction of both inventory and cost of goods sold.PBM rebates are recorded on historical PBM results and trends and are revised on a regular basis depending on the Companys latest forecasts, as well as information received from rebate sources.Should actual results differ, adjustments will be recorded in future earnings when the adjustment becomes known.In some instances, rebate payments are shared with the Companys Plan Sponsors.PBM rebates earned by the Company are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold.PBM rebates shared with clients are recorded as a reduction of revenue consistent with the sales incentive provisions of ASC 605.Lease AccountingThe Company accounts for operating leasing transactions by recording rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the lease starting on the date it gains possession of leased property. The Company includes tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays received from landlords and the effect of any rent escalation clauses, as adjustments to straight-line rent expense over the expected term of the lease.Capital lease transactions are reflected as a liability at the inception of the lease based on the present value of the minimum lease payments or, if lower, the fair value of the property. Assets recorded under capital leases are depreciated in the same manner as owned property.Income TaxesAs part of the process of preparing the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income TaxesASC 740. ASC 740 requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to realize the benefit from its deferred tax assets.The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, as prescribed by Federal tax laws and the tax laws of the state and local jurisdictions in which it operates.The Companys uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination and are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the recognition threshold and measurement attributes of ASC 740 are met.Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax expense.Financial InstrumentsThe Companys financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued interest and its line of credit. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued interest and its line of credit approximate fair value due to their fully liquid or short-term nature.Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense under the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock CompensationASC 718.At December31, 2014, the Company has twostock-based compensation planspursuant to which incentive stock options ISOs, non-qualified stock options NQSOs, stock appreciation rights SARs, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units may be granted to employees and non-employee directors. Option and stock awards are typically settled by issuing authorized but unissued shares of the Company67Table of ContentsThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the measurement date using a binomial option-pricing model.The fair value of the award is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company expenses restricted stock awards based on vesting requirements, including time elapsed, market conditions and/or performance conditions.Because of these requirements, the weighted average period for which the expense is recognized varies. The Company expenses SAR awards based on vesting requirements. In addition, because they are settled with cash, the fair value of the SAR awards are revalued on a quarterly basis.Income Loss Per ShareThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income loss per common share in thousands, except for per share amounts:Year Ended December 31,201420132012Numerator:Loss from continuing operations, net of income  from discontinued operations, net of income taxes4,08612,66376,982Net income  - Basic and Diluted:Weighted average number of common shares  Per Common Share:Loss from continuing operations, basic and  loss from discontinued operations, basic and diluted006019137Income loss per common share, basic and diluted$215$108$115The computation of diluted shares for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012excludes the effect of 31 million, 31 millionand 34 millionwarrants with an exercise price of $1000issued in connection with the acquisition of CHS as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive to income loss per common share from continuing operations. In addition, the computation of diluted shares for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013and 2012excludes the effect of 70 million, 61 millionand 50 million, respectively, of other common stock equivalents as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive to income loss per common share from continuing operations. ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share,requires that income from continuing operations be used as the basis for determining whether the inclusion of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward ExistsASU 2013-11. ASU 2013-11 provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit would be offset against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed. In that case, the liability associated with the unrecognized tax benefit is presented in the financial statements as a reduction to the related deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. In situations in which a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the jurisdiction or the tax law of the jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit will be presented in the financial statements as a liability and will not be combined with deferred tax assets. The Company adopted ASU 2013-11 effective January 1, 2014 with no material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08 Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an EntityASU 2014-08 which amends the existing GAAP discontinued operations classification criteria to require a significant strategic shift in an entitys operations. The new guidance also simplifies the classification analysis by eliminating the continuing involvement criteria.

ASU 2014-08 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-08 and anticipates that the adoption will have no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements68Table of ContentsIn May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 606 becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606.In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ASU 2014-12. ASU 2014-12 provides new guidance on accounting for share-based payments requiring a specific performance target to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards when that performance target may be achieved after the requisite service period for the award. ASU 2014-12 is effective January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.

In addition, 3,968,750shares of common stock were offered and sold by certain existing stockholders in an underwritten secondary offering completed on the same date and at the same offering price to the public.Net proceeds to the Company were $1184 millionafter underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. The Company used $210 millionand approximately $611 millionof the net proceeds to i repay outstanding borrowings under the Company prior credit facility with Healthcare Finance Group the Prior Credit Facility and ii fund a portion of the CarePoint acquisition as described in Note 4 - Acquisitions below, respectively. The Company used the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which included, among other things, capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding debt or equity securities, debt servicing requirements or redemption of our short-term or long-term borrowings, or for other working capital requirements.Treasury StockDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, 54,579and 25,999shares, respectively, were surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards.The Company holds a total of 2,637,099shares of treasury stock at December31, 2014acquired under current and prior repurchase programs as well as forfeitures to satisfy tax obligations in the vesting of restricted stock awards. During the year ended December 31, 2013, noshares of treasury stock were acquired or issued.Common Stock Purchase WarrantsIn connection with the acquisition of Critical Homecare Solutions Holdings, Inc. CHS in March 2010, the Company issued 34 millionwarrants exercisable for BioScrip common stock.The warrants have a fiveyear term with an exercise price of $1000per share. They are exercisable at any time prior to the expiration date.The warrants also contain provisions whereby the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants will be increased if the Company were to execute certain dilutive transactions such as stock splits, stock dividends or the issuance of shares below 90%of market value at the time of issuance.The Company has determined that the warrants meet the conditions for equity classification in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, these warrants were classified as equity and included in additional paid-in capital.During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company issued 78,567shares of common stock pursuant to the cashless exercise of 256,175of the warrants. Nowarrants were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December31, 2014, 31 millionof the warrants remain outstanding69Table of ContentsThe fair value of the warrants of $123 millionwas calculated as of the acquisition date using the Black-Scholes model.The Black-Scholes model used the following assumptions: volatility of 62%, risk free interest rate of 263%, dividend yield of 0%and expected term of five years.In addition, there was a discount applied for lack of marketability of 135%.This discount was considered appropriate because the warrants were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Securities Act and the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants were unregistered shares and subject to transfer restrictions as of the acquisition date. The shares were subsequently registered on Form S-3 on April 2, 2013 which was declared effective on April 4, 2013.NOTE 4--ACQUISITIONSCarePoint Partners Holdings LLCOn August 23, 2013, the Company closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities that constituted the home infusion business the CarePoint Business of CarePoint Partners Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and its subsidiaries collectively CarePoint. CarePoint was a provider of home and alternate-site infusion therapy for patients with complex, acute and chronic illnesses. CarePoint serviced approximately 20,500patients annually through 28sites of service in ninestates in the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions.The cash purchase price paid at closing was $2111 million. The purchase agreement contemplated a targeted level of net working capital. Subsequent to the closing, the Company and the sellers agreed that additional net working capital adjustments of approximately $18 millionwere due to the Company. These working capital adjustments were primarily related to the value of accounts receivable and prepaid expenses as of the date of acquisition. The Company received payment for these amounts during the year ended December 31, 2014.In addition, the purchase agreement provided that the purchase price could be increased by contingent consideration of $100 millionif the CarePoint Business achieved a specified level of product gross profit during the one-year period following the closing date. If the specified level of product gross profit was not achieved, no contingent consideration would be due to the sellers. The Company reported actual product gross profit for the measurement period from September 1, 2013 to August 31, 2014 to the sellers on October 15, 2014. The report indicated that the requisite level of product gross profit was not achieved during the measurement period. Should the sellers disagree with the Companys report, the purchase agreement provides for the dispute to be settled through arbitration.At the date of acquisition, the fair value of the $100 millioncontingent consideration was estimated at $98 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using Level 3 inputs based on the present value of various payout scenarios, weighted on the basis of probability. The most important factor in determining the probability of payout at various balance sheet dates has been the business forecasts and actual results for the CarePoint Business standalone and merged market sites.As of December31, 2014, the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured considering the required product gross profit was not achieved during the measurement period and the uncertainties around any potential arbitration process. As a result, the fair value of the contingent consideration was maintained at $46 millionas of December31, 2014. Should an arbitrator rule against the Company, an additional expense of $54 millionwill be recorded over and above the accrual of $46 millionestimated at December31, 2014. Should an arbitrator rule in favor of the Company, the liability for contingent consideration will be reversed and, as a result, additional income of $46 millionwill be recorded. The liability for the contingent consideration is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.The $52 millionof income resulting from the reduction of the fair value of the contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2014is included in the change in fair value of contingent consideration in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.The Company funded the cash payment at closing with a combination of cash on hand and $1500 millionin borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities see Note 9 - Debt. 70Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes the Companys assessment of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of closing of the acquisition of the CarePoint Business in thousands:Fair ValueCash$14Accounts  current assets215Property and equipment3,266Identifiable intangible assets116,700Current liabilities8,697Non-current liabilities721Total identifiable net  cash and fair value of contingent consideration$219,0921The following table summarizes the amounts and useful lives assigned to identifiable intangible assets in  LivesAmountsRecognized as of the Closing DateCustomer relationships2 - 4 years$13,600Trademarks2 years2,600Non-compete agreements5 years500Total identifiable intangible assets acquired$16,700The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition was allocated to goodwill. The value of goodwill represents the value the Company expects to be created by combining the various operations of the CarePoint Business with the Companys operations, including the expansion into new infusion markets, the opportunity to consolidate and upgrade certain existing facilities, access to new patients and potential cost savings and synergies. The CarePoint transaction was structured such that the amount allocated to goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes in accordance with applicable tax rules.The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014include revenues and income from continuing operations of the CarePoint Business of $1579 millionand $18 million. The accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations include revenues and income from continuing operations of $558 millionand $23 millionrelated to the CarePoint Business for the period from the date of acquisition to December31, 2013.HomeChoice Partners, Inc.On February 1, 2013, the Company acquired 100%of the ownership interest in HomeChoice Partners, Inc., a Delaware corporation HomeChoice. Prior to the Company acquisition, HomeChoice was a provider of alternate-site infusion pharmacy services that serviced approximately 15,000patients annually and had 14infusion pharmacy locations in Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Missouri and Alabama.The cash purchase price of the HomeChoice acquisition was $729 millionpaid at the closing date. In addition, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase price could be increased by contingent consideration of up to $100 millionif HomeChoice were to attain certain performance milestones in the first year following the closing and an additional $100 millionif HomeChoice were to attain certain performance milestones in the second year following the closing, for total possible contingent consideration of up to $200 million. At the date of acquisition, the fair value of the potential contingent consideration, using Level 3 inputs, was estimated at $80 million. The $200 millionmaximum contingent consideration was established using aggressive growth targets meant to achieve operating results in excess of transaction valuation model assumptions.  Given the aggressiveness of the earnout target threshold, the Company assigned less than 50%probability of payout among the various payout scenarios considered71Table of ContentsWhile the acquisition has generated revenues as expected in the transaction valuation model, revenues through December31, 2014have not exceeded the aggressive earnout performance pace required. Specifically, revenue generating opportunities through various potential business relationships have not come to fruition and thus the probability of attaining the high level of growth required to achieve the earnout has been diminishing over the past year resulting in a lower probability of a future payout of contingent consideration. As of December31, 2014, the fair value of the contingent consideration was again remeasured at fair value using actual operating results through December31, 2014and forecasted operating results for the remainder of the measurement period. As a result of this remeasurement, the probability of the payment of any contingent consideration appeared negligible and the fair value of the contingent consideration was reduced to $0as of December31, 2014. The $21 millionand $59 millionof income resulting from the reduction in the fair value of the contingent liability is included in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The Company funded the acquisition with a combination of cash and the Prior Credit Facility.The table below summarizes the Companys assessment of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date of HomeChoice in thousands:Fair ValueAccounts  current assets154Property and equipment2,432Identifiable intangible assets14,000Other non-current assets30Current liabilities4,073Total identifiable net  cash and fair value of contingent consideration$80,9211The following table summarizes the amounts and useful lives assigned to identifiable intangible assets in  LivesAmountsRecognized at the Closing DateCustomer relationships5 mo. - 3 years$2,000Trademarks23 months1,000Non-compete agreements1 year1,000Total identifiable intangible assets acquired$4,000The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition was allocated to goodwill.

At the date of acquisition, the fair value of the potential contingent payments of $30 millionwas estimated at $29 million. The fair value of the contingent liability was determined using Level 3 inputs based on the present value of various payout scenarios, weighted on the basis of probability. The $01 millionof expense resulting from the increase in the fair value of the contingent liability is included in change in fair value of contingent consideration in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company has made contingent payments of $13 millionand $17 millionduring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, based on the achievement of expected operating results. As of December31, 2014, the contingent consideration has been fully paid.The table below summarizes the Companys assessment of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date of InfuScience in thousands:Fair ValueCash$23Accounts  current assets371Property and equipment751Identifiable intangible assets1400Other non-current assets349Current liabilities 4,428Total identifiable net  cash and fair value of contingent consideration$41,4191The following table summarizes the amounts and useful lives assigned to identifiable intangible assets in  LivesAmountsRecognized at the Closing DateCustomer relationships5 months$400Total identifiable intangible assets acquired$400The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition was allocated to goodwill.

The Company denies any allegations of wrongdoing in the consolidated class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on February 19, 2014 against the Company, certain of its directors and officers, certain underwriters in the Companys April 2013 underwritten public offering of its common stock, and a certain stockholder of the Company. The consolidated complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Companys securities between November 9, 2012 and November 6, 2013, inclusive, and persons and entities who purchased the Companys securities pursuant or traceable to two underwritten public offerings of the Companys common stock conducted in April 2013, 87Table of Contentsand August 2013. The consolidated complaint alleges generally that the defendants made material misstatements and/or failed to disclose matters related the Legacy Divisions distribution of the Medication as well as the Companys PBM Services segment. The consolidated complaint asserts claims under Sections11, 12a2 and 15 of the Securities Act and Sections 10b and 20a of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. All defendants in the case moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint on April 28, 2014. Briefing on the motion to dismiss was complete on July 28, 2014. The Company believes all of the claims in these class action lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its defense or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of these actions. Additional similar lawsuits may be filed. Moreover, the Company is not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.Professional Home Care Services LitigationOn March31, 2009, Professional Home Care Services, Inc. PHCS, a subsidiary of the Company, was sued by Alexander Infusion, LLC, a New York-based home infusion company Alexander Infusion, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York the Lawsuit. The complaint alleged principally breach of contract arising in connection with PHCSs failure to consummate an acquisition of Alexander Infusion after failing to satisfy the conditions to PHCSs obligation to close. On April 4, 2014, PHCS and the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Alexander Infusion and its affiliate Avantiscripts, LLC collectively the Alexander Parties to resolve all outstanding claims arising out of the Lawsuit in exchange for payment by PHCS to the Alexander Parties in the amount of $325,000, and the Lawsuit was dismissed on April 8, 2014. The Company did not pay any cash under the settlement agreement. Rather, the settlement amount of $325,000was offset against an amount of $325,000on accounts receivable due to the Company from the Alexander Parties. In addition, under the merger agreement dated as of January 24, 2010, by and among the Company, CHS and the former CHS stockholders, the former CHS stockholders agreed to indemnify the Company, subject to certain limits, in connection with any losses arising from claims made in respect of the acquisition agreement entered into between PHCS and Alexander Infusion.PBM Services Payment DelayThe Company had historically engaged a third party processor to process PBM Services cash card claims. The third party processor has ceased paying amounts due to the Company. As of December31, 2014, the total amount owed to the Company is approximately $68 million. The Company has initiated arbitration to collect approximately $68 milliondue from the third party processor. As of December31, 2014, noreserve has been provided for the amounts due to the Company as we believe the amounts owed will be paid in full however there are uncertainties around any arbitration process.Government RegulationVarious federal and state laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry do or may impact the Companys current and planned operations, including, without limitation, federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks in government health programs, federal and state antitrust and drug distribution laws, and a wide variety of consumer protection, insurance and other state laws and regulations. While management believes the Company is in substantial compliance with all existing laws and regulations material to the operation of its business, such laws and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are uncertain in their application. As controversies continue to arise in the healthcare industry, federal and state regulation and enforcement priorities in this area can be expected to increase, the impact of which cannot be predicted.From time to time, the Company responds to subpoenas and requests for information from governmental agencies. The Company cannot predict with certainty what the outcome of any of the foregoing might be. While the Company believes it is in substantial compliance with all laws, rules and regulations that affects its business and operations, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more existing laws or that any such challenge would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not successful, could have a material effect upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. A violation of the Federal anti-kickback statute, for example, may result in substantial criminal penalties, as well as suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Moreover, the costs and expenses associated with defending these actions, even where successful, can be significant. Further, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to obtain or maintain any of the regulatory approvals that may be required to operate its business, and the failure to do so could have a material effect on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.LeasesThe Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under various operating leases with third parties.

Infusion services include the dispensing and administering of infusion-based drugs, which typically require nursing support and clinical management services, equipment to administer the correct dosage and patient training designed to improve patient outcomes.The PBM Services operating and reportable segment consists of PBM services, which primarily consists of discount card programs. The discount card programs provide a cost effective alternative for individuals who may be uninsured, underinsured or may have restrictive coverage that disallows reimbursement for certain medications. Under these discount programs, individuals who present a discount card at one of the Companys participating network pharmacies receive prescription medications at a discounted price compared to the retail price. In addition, in the Companys capacity as a pharmacy benefit manager, it has fully funded prescription benefit programs where the Company reimburses its network pharmacies and third party payors in turn reimburse the Company based on Medi-Span reported pricing for those claims fulfilled for their plan participants.The Companys chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on Segment Adjusted EBITDA.
