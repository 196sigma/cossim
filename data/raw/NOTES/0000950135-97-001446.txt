ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS
ArQule, Inc. the Company is engaged in the discovery, development and
production of novel chemical compounds for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and
agrichemical industries. Its operations are focused on the integration of
combinatorial chemistry, structure-guided rational drug design and other
proprietary technologies which automate the process of chemical synthesis to
produce arrays of small organic chemical compounds used to generate and optimize
drug development candidates.
In May 1993 and in connection with the formation of ArQule Partners L.P.
the Partnership, Legomer Technologies, Inc. LTI, formerly Molecular
Recognition Technologies, Inc., a company owned by the two founding limited
partners in the Partnership, contributed to the Partnership all rights and
interests in certain LTI patented technology the Technology in exchange for
a 05% general partner ownership position. The Company was legally incorporated
on December 30, 1993 to carry on the operations of the Partnership. Immediately
following the incorporation of the Company, the Partnership transferred
substantially all of its assets, liabilities and patented technology the
Operating Assets, having an aggregate net book value of $771,000, to the
Company in exchange for 1,500 shares of the Company $001 par value common
stock, representing all of the Company then outstanding common stock. Because
of the related party nature of these transactions, the Operating Assets and
Technology transfers have been accounted for as transfers of assets between
entities under common control. Accordingly, the accompanying financial
statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the
Company at historical amounts as if the transfers occurred at the inception of
the Partnership.
Amounts which reflect the funding of the Partnership operations prior to
the conversion of certain shares of the Company common stock into Series A
preferred stock Note 9 are reflected as paid-in capital in the accompanying
balance sheet and as capital contributed by ArQule Partners L.P. in the
statements of changes in redeemable preferred stock and stockholders' equity
deficit and of cash flows. Such funding totaled $2,100,000 of cash for the
year ended December 31, 1994, and was comprised of aggregate investments in
general partnership interests of $20,000 and limited partnership interests of
$2,080,000.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these
financial statements are as follows:
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company
invests its available cash primarily in money market mutual funds and U.S.
government and other investment grade debt securities which have strong credit
ratings. These investments are subject to minimal credit and market risks. The
Company specifically identifies securities for purposes of determining gains and
losses on the sale of cash equivalents and short-term investments. At December
31, 1996 and 1995, the Company has classified its investments as
available-for-sale as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 115.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the Company financial instruments consist
of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, notes
receivable from related party, accounts payable and accrued expenses and
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock. The carrying amount of these
instruments approximate their fair values.

ARQULE, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Assets under capital
leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their
estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases by use of the
straight-line method. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition
Compound development revenue relates to revenue from significant
collaborative agreements Note 3 and from licensing of compound arrays. Revenue
from collaborative agreements relates to the delivery of compounds and to
compound development work and is recognized using the percentage of completion
method. The application of this revenue recognition method is dependent on the
contractual arrangement of either compound delivery or development. Accordingly,
revenue is recognized on the proportional achievement of deliveries against a
compound delivery schedule or as development labor is expended against a total
research and development labor plan. Payments received under these arrangements
prior to the completion of the related work are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from licensing of compound arrays with no additional obligations is
recognized upon delivery of the compound array. License option fees represent
payments made to the Company for a right to evaluate and negotiate the terms of
potential licensing arrangements and are recognized as revenue as the options
are granted, as the Company has no further obligations and as payments are
nonrefundable.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue represents the actual costs incurred in connection with
performance pursuant to collaborative agreements and the costs incurred to
produce compound arrays. These costs consist primarily of payroll and
payroll-related costs, supplies and overhead expenses.
Stock Compensation
Options granted to employees and directors are accounted for in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Options granted to nonemployees are
accounted for using the fair value method and are recognized as compensation
expense over their respective vesting periods.
Unaudited Pro Forma Net Loss Per Share
Pro forma net loss per share is determined by dividing the net loss by the
weighted average number of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding
during the period, assuming the conversion of all convertible preferred stock
which occurred upon the closing of the Company initial public offering as
described in Note 9.
Common stock equivalents, although anti-dilutive, issued at prices below
the offering price per share during the twelve month period preceding the
initial filing of the Registration Statement have been included in the
calculation of unaudited pro forma net loss per share using the treasury stock
method and the initial public offering price of $1200 per share as if
outstanding for all periods presented through June 30, 1996.
Historical net loss per share has not been presented as the Series A
convertible preferred stock would have been omitted from the weighted average
shares outstanding as it is anti-dilutive and was issued more than twelve months

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1994 and 1995 financial
statements to conform to the 1996 presentation. These reclassifications had no
effect on the net loss for 1994 and 1995.
3. SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS
The Company has entered into a number of license, research and development
agreements the Agreements with certain corporate collaborators. One
Agreement was entered into with Solvay Duphar B.V. Solvay, a related party
Note 9. Revenue related to the Solvay Agreement is included in compound
development revenue--related party. Under the terms of these Agreements, the
Company will provide a certain number of compounds per year and has granted the
right to screen these compounds against targets to identify biological activity
an Active Compound and will provide research and development services. The
collaborators have the right to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license the
License for any Active Compound identified. The initial terms of these
Agreements generally range from two to five years during which period the
collaborators make payments to the Company for technology access, delivery of
compounds and for its research and development services. In exchange for a
License, the Company will receive milestone payments during product development
and royalty payments based on the sales of the product. Solvay also has a right
which expires on December 31, 1997 to license certain of the Company
technologies on a nonexclusive basis for internal use only. Deferred revenue
represents payments made to the Company in advance for technology access,
delivery of compounds and research and development pursuant to these Agreements.
At December 31, 1995, $100,000 of the deferred revenue amount is from a related
party.
Under the terms of material transfer agreements with biotechnology
companies the biotech collaborators, the Company has granted the biotech
collaborator the nonexclusive, royalty-free license to test certain compound
arrays supplied by the Company. Upon identification of an active compound, the
Company will negotiate a joint drug development program with the biotech
collaborator to develop the compound, provided the Company has not previously
licensed the compound. Under the collaboration agreements with these joint drug
development programs, the Company and the biotech collaborator will each bear
the costs and expenses of their respective activities. Proceeds received on
sales or a third party license of the jointly developed compound will first
reimburse development costs incurred by each party on a pro rata basis. After
all such reimbursements have been made, the remaining proceeds will be split
evenly between the parties.

exercise dates, prices and methods of payment.
In 1996, the stockholders approved, the 1996 Director Stock Option Plan

the grant date consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company pro
forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share would have been as follows:
YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31,
1995     1996
Pro forma net   $2,254,000 $3,186,000
Pro forma net loss per      033    041

members of its scientific advisory board under the Equity Incentive Plan. The
estimated value of these options totaled $709,000, was recorded as deferred
compensation and is being amortized as compensation expense over the vesting
period of the options.
For the purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated value of each
employee and nonemployee option grant was calculated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no
dividend yield for both years; 45% volatility for nonemployee grants in both
years and employee grants subsequent to the initial filing of the Registration
Statement in connection with the
