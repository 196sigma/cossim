DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 1Significant Accounting Policies Principles of ConsolidationThe
consolidated financial statements of Deltic Timber Corporation Deltic or the Company include the accounts of Deltic and all majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of significant intercompany transactions and
accounts. Use of EstimatesIn
the preparation of the Companys financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management has made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the
reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents include U.S. government securities that have a maturity of three months or less from
the date of purchase. Allowance for
Doubtful AccountsThe Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a review of the specific receivables outstanding. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the balance in the allowance account was $88,000 and $127,000, respectively.
InventoriesInventories of
logs, lumber, and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market, primarily using the average cost method. Log costs include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate. Lumber costs include materials, labor, and production overhead. For
additional information, see Note 3 Inventories. Investment in Real Estate Held for Development and SaleReal estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect
costs, including amenities. These costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value. Direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis, while indirect costs for the Companys three development
areasChenal Valley, Chenal Downs, and Red Oak Ridgeare allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area. Investment in Del-Tin FiberInvestment in Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. Del-Tin Fiber, a 50 percent-owned limited
liability company, is carried at cost and is adjusted for the Companys proportionate share of its undistributed earnings or losses. The Companys equity-method-basis carrying value for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber is evaluated for
possible impairment, as applicable under the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB 18. This evaluation resulted in a determination that the Companys investment was impaired as of December 31, 2002, and the
carrying amount of the investment was written off, to zero, for the 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information, see Note 4Investment in Del-Tin Fiber. Timber and TimberlandsTimber and timberlands, which includes purchased stumpage inventory
and logging facilities, is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities and includes no estimated future reforestation cost. The cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume
of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable. Logging facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements, are depreciated using the straight-line method over a ten-year estimated
life. The Company estimates its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques. The cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are
capitalized. Fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred.

DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 1Significant Accounting Policies cont. Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty,
plant, and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight-line method. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase
the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur. Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for possible
impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as applicable, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized
for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation ceases. Revenue RecognitionRevenue from the sale
of lumber and wood by-products is recorded at the time of shipment. Revenue from the sale of timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded when legal title passes to the purchaser, which is generally upon delivery of a legally executed timber
deed and receipt of payment for the timber. Revenue from intersegment timber sales is recorded when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales, which are generally made at prices which approximate market, are eliminated in the consolidated
financial statements. Revenue from timberland and real estate sales is recorded when the sale is closed and legal title is transferred, which is generally at the time the purchaser executes the real estate closing documents and makes payment to the
title company handling the closing. Income TaxesThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and
liabilities, based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Stock-Based CompensationAt December 31, 2002, Deltic had a stock-based compensation plan for which the Company applies
the recognition and measurement principles of APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for those plans. Stock-based employee compensation expense is accrued for the intrinsic value, if any, of stock
options or restricted stock granted over the applicable vesting periods using the straight-line method. Options granted by the Company have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. As of
November 2001, the Company eliminated certain option exercise procedures, resulting in a change to fixed-plan accounting treatment for all options. Prior to that date, the Company was required to apply variable plan accounting standards which
required adjustment of the cost of options granted for changes in the market value per share of the Companys common stock. For additional information, see Note 15Incentive Plans.

For the pro forma
net income calculation in the preceding table, the fair value of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively: dividend
yields of 106 percent, 106 percent, and 97 percent; expected volatility of 3119 percent, 3852 percent, and 3859 percent; risk-free interest rates of 437 percent, 508 percent, and 680 percent; and expected lives of five years. Using these
assumptions, the weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted in 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $926, $905, and $903, respectively. Pensions and Other Postretirement BenefitsThe Company sponsors both a qualified and a nonqualified, noncontributory,
defined benefit retirement plan that covers substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service, including those with Murphy Oil Corporation Murphy Oil, the companys former parent, and final career-average-pay
formulas as defined by the plans. The qualified plan is funded to accumulate sufficient assets to provide for accrued benefits. The nonqualified plan, a supplemental executive plan, is not funded; the Company pays any benefits due under this plan on
a monthly basis. The Company also sponsors a defined
benefit health care plan and a life insurance benefit plan for substantially all retired employees. The Company measures the costs of its obligations for these plans based on its best estimate. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees
render the services necessary to earn these postretirement benefits.

DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 1Significant Accounting Policies cont. Advertising CostsAdvertising costs,
primarily related to marketing efforts for the Companys real estate developments, are expensed as incurred. These costs amounted to $792,000 in 2002, $725,000 in 2001, and $634,000 in 2000 and are reflected in Cost of Sales on the Consolidated
Statements of Income. Capitalized
InterestThe Company capitalizes interest for qualifying assets constructed or otherwise produced for which interest on directly associated debt was incurred. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying assets and is
amortized over the useful lives of those assets. Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures include additions to Investment in Real Estate Held for Development and Sale; Timber and Timberlands; and Property, Plant, and Equipment. Net Change in Purchased Stumpage
InventoryPurchased stumpage inventory consists of timber-cutting rights purchased from third parties specifically for use in the Companys sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and usage of this acquired stumpage inventory,
the net change in inventory can either be a source or use of funds in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Earnings per Common ShareEarnings per share EPS amounts presented are calculated under the provisions of
the SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed based on earnings available to common shareholders [net income/loss less accrued preferred dividends] and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The earnings
per share assuming dilution amounts presented are computed based on earnings available to common shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including shares assumed to be issued under the Companys stock option
plan. For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share computations, see Note 17 Earnings per Share. Impact of Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS 145 rescinds SFAS 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and an amendment of that statement,
SFAS 64, Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements, in addition to SFAS 44, Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers. SFAS 145 also amends SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency between the
required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS 145 also amends other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions. Effective dates for SFAS 145 vary by issue addressed. Adoption of SFAS 145 is not expected to have a material impact on
the Companys financial statements. In June 2002, the
FASB issued SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred, and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. Adoption of SFAS 146 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys financial statements. 
46 Table of Contents
DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 1Significant Accounting Policies cont. In October 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 147, Acquisitions of Certain
Financial Institutions. SFAS 147 amended SFAS 72, Accounting for Certain Acquisitions of Banking or Thrift Institutions; SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets; and FASB Interpretation 9, Applying APB 16 and 17 When
a Savings and Loan Association or Similar Institution is Acquired in a Business Combination Accounted for by the Purchase Method. SFAS 147 requires that acquisitions of financial institutions be accounted for using the purchase method and the
recoverability of any intangible assets recognized at acquisition be evaluated using the same provisions as for other long-lived assets that are held and used and is effective for acquisitions for which the date of acquisition is on or after October
1, 2002. The effective date for evaluating previously recognized intangible assets for impairment was October 1, 2002. SFAS 147 will not have an impact on the Companys financial statements. In November 2002, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim
and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantors fiscal
year-end. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements in connection with its guarantee of funding the
debt sinking fund requirements of Del-Tin Fiber. For additional information regarding these disclosures, see Note 4Investment in Del-Tin Fiber. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure. SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to
require more prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements. The Company currently applies the accounting
measurement provisions of APB 25 to account for stock-based compensation and has not adopted the measurement provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148; however, it has adopted the disclosure requirements of both SFAS 123 and SFAS 148.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 is an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities, which have the following
characteristics: 1 the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties and/or 2 the equity investors lack one or more of the
essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest. This interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after
that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. Adoption of FIN 46 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.

2Discontinued Agriculture Segment In August 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved the disposal of Deltics agriculture segment assets, subject to using the sales
proceeds to purchase additional pine timberland, in a tax-deferred exchange. All 38,800 net acres formerly deemed to be agriculture lands, as well as all related agriculture operational assets, had been sold by year-end 2001. As a result of the
sales transactions completed during 2001 and 2000, pretax gains on disposal of agriculture segment assets of $13,453,000 after related non-cash expenses of $1,001,000 and $17,381,000, respectively, are reported as discontinued operations by the
Company in its 2001 and 2000 Consolidated Statements of Income. Operating results for the agriculture segment are also reported as discontinued operations, net of income taxes. Total net sales of the discontinued agriculture segment for 2001 and 2000, excluding asset sales proceeds, were
$276,000 and $8,272,000, respectively. Operating income of the agriculture segment during 2000, prior to the measurement date for determining discontinued operations, was $715,000, $440,000 net of related taxes of $275,000. For 2001, the gain on
disposal of the agriculture segment was $13,663,000 before income taxes, consisting of the $13,453,000 gain on sales of assets and $210,000 income from operations since the measurement date, $8,357,000 after related income taxes amounting to
$5,306,000. Gain on the disposal in 2000 was $17,150,000 before income taxes, consisting of the $17,381,000 gain on sales of assets and $231,000 loss from operations since the measurement date, $10,416,000 after related income taxes amounting to
$6,734,000. Since the Company disposed of the agriculture
segment in a tax-deferred exchange, all proceeds from the farmland sales were deposited with a qualified intermediary. In addition, Deltic also sold approximately 5,200 net acres of non-strategic Louisiana hardwood timberland during the third and
fourth quarters of 2000, which were also replaced with pine timberland in a tax-deferred exchange. These combined proceeds for 2000, $16,317,000 after deducting amounts expended during 2000 to purchase replacement pine timberland, were held by the
intermediary, as trustee, at December 31, 2000. These funds, in addition to similar proceeds received in 2001, were used during 2001 to acquire pine timberland designated as replacement property, with capital expenditures totaling
$55,890,000. A portion of the 2000 farmland and hardwood
timberland sales were deemed by the Company to be related-party transactions. These transactions include sales to Epps Plantation, LLC, which is owned by the Charles H. Murphy Family Investments Limited Partnership. The estate of Charles Murphy
holds a significant ownership of the Companys common stock; and four of the Companys directors are related to the late Charles Murphy. This related-party farmland sale amounted to $14,413,000 for 12,600 net acres. In addition,
approximately 450 net acres were sold to Munoco Company L.C. Munoco for $346,000. The managing partner of Munoco is Robert C. Nolan, Chairman of Deltics Board of Directors and a nephew of late Charles Murphy. The sales price for
all related-party farmland sale transactions was derived from an approved market index formula which produced prices in excess of the average of the appraised value of the acreage involved. Epps Plantation, LLC also purchased 2,600 net acres of the
hardwood timberland sold for $4,864,000. During 2000,
Deltic and the other owners of Ashly Plantation This was an undivided-interest farmland operation which conducted business as Ashly Plantation, a partnership for income tax purposes, of which Deltics share of assets was 648 percent. Upon
completion of the exchange of the operations farmland for pine timberland, all former minority owners received either cash or acreage representing their respective ownership shares. acted to acquire replacement property prior to the
completion of the disposal of its farmland, utilizing the form of a reverse exchange as established by an IRS revenue procedure. As part of this transaction, Ashly Plantation borrowed $4,000,000 from the Company, with the proceeds to be
used as a portion of an advance, in the form of an interest-bearing note, to the intermediate accommodating title owner required for the reverse exchange. The accommodator used the funds provided by this advance as

fourth quarter of 2000, Deltic also acted to acquire replacement property prior to the completion of the disposal of the remainder of its farmland by utilizing a reverse exchange. The Company advanced funds to an accommodating
title holder which were used to acquire the designated timberland. This advance, which was in the form of an interest-bearing note, combined with the similar advance by Ashly Plantation to its accommodator, in addition to the Ashly Plantation
minority owners portion of the amount borrowed from Deltic, amounted to $16,364,000 at December 31, 2000. During 2001, these advances were repaid to the Company. Note 3Inventories Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following:  Thousands of dollars

and income tax purposes the Company utilizes the lower of cost or market basis for determining inventory carrying values. Lumber inventory amounts at December 31, 2002 and 2001, are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, and the
Consolidated Statements of Income include a charge of $329,000 in 2001 for an inventory write-down, which is reflected in Cost of Sales. $120,000 of this amount was during the fourth quarter of 2001. Note 4Investment in Del-Tin Fiber Deltic owns 50 percent of the membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber,
which completed construction and commenced production operations of a medium density fiberboard MDF plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, during 1998. On April 25, 2002, Deltic announced that Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. had been retained
as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Companys investment in Del-Tin Fiber. Subsequently, Deltic announced that following a review of these strategic alternatives, it was determined that the MDF
business did not represent a growth area for the Company. Consequently, the Company intends to exit this business upon the earliest, reasonable opportunity provided by the market. As a result of this decision, the Companys evaluation of
possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the equity method investee, as required by APB 18, resulted in a determination that the Companys investment was impaired as of December 31, 2002, and the carrying amount of such
investment was written off, to zero, for the Companys 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The write-off, amounting to $18,723,000, was included in the fourth quarter operating results of the Company. However, in performing this impairment
evaluation, the Companys management made a number of estimates and assumptions related to the timing of the sale of its ownership interest, the expected selling price for its interest, future operating results for Del-Tin Fiber, and the
ability to refinance the joint-ventures long-term debt. It is reasonably possible that a change in these estimates and assumptions might occur, which could have a material impact on the Companys future financial statements. Due to the
Companys commitment to fund its share of any of the facilitys operating working capital needs until the facility is able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or Deltics ownership interest in the
facility is sold, the Company will continue to recognize losses related to Del-Tin Fiber to the extent of these advances. The management of Del-Tin Fiber has performed evaluations of possible impairment of the long-lived 
49 Table of Contents
DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 4Investment in Del-Tin Fiber cont. assets of the plant in accordance with SFAS 121 and/or 144, as
applicable. To-date, these analyses have indicated that no impairment exists at the Del-Tin Fiber level. Del-Tin Fiber has its own credit facility, totaling $89,000,000 under which each owner has agreed to a contingent equity contribution agreement with
Del-Tin Fiber and the group of banks from whom the project financing was obtained. Under this agreement, both owners have contractually agreed to a contingent equity agreement which requires them to fund any deficiency in contributions to either
Del-Tin Fibers bond sinking fund or debt service reserve up to a cumulative total of $17,500,000 per owner. Del-Tin Fibers project financing agreement did not require sinking fund contributions until the first quarter of 2001. Sinking
fund deposits were $6,019,000 in 2001 and $7,676,000 in 2002, and are scheduled to be $8,956,000 in 2003, $10,457,000 in 2004, and $55,892,000 in 2005. However, the final sinking fund deposit would be reduced by any amount of interest earned on the
accumulated balance of such deposits. To date, the owners have voluntarily funded all required sinking fund deposits, and thus have not reduced their respective contingent equity contribution agreement obligation, in order to obtain annual renewals
of the letters of credit supporting bonds issued to finance the majority of the facilitys initial construction cost. In addition, each owner has committed to a production support agreement, under which each owner has agreed to make support
obligation payments to Del-Tin Fiber to provide, on the occurrence of certain events, additional funds for payment of debt service until the plant is able to successfully complete a minimum production test. Both owners of Del-Tin Fiber have also
pledged their respective membership interest in the joint venture as collateral under the project financing agreement. Both have also agreed to fund any operating working capital needs until the facility is able to consistently generate sufficient
funds to meet its cash requirements. These contingent
obligations are not reduced as a result of the Companys write-off of the carrying value of its investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of December 31, 2002. Due to the probable requirement for Deltic to advance to Del-Tin Fiber amounts equal to its
half of the facilitys 2003 quarterly sinking fund obligation, based on the plants 2003 cash flow projections, the Company recorded a current contingent liability, in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, to reflect this
amount. This liability, in the amount of $4,478,000, is included in Deferred Revenues and Other Accrued Liabilities in the Companys 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. No additional liability was required for such payments after 2003 due to
projected improvement in Del-Tin Fibers cash flows and to the Companys intent to exit the business or to refinance the joint-ventures long-term debt by the end of 2003. The maximum potential amount of future payments that could be
required of the Company under current contractual guarantees is limited to the $17,500,000 committed under the contingent equity agreement. However, with the Company currently funding its share of Del-Tin Fibers sinking fund contribution on a
voluntary basis, potential future payments are estimated at approximately $37,653,000 if the Company is not able to refinance the facilitys long-term debt and has not sold its ownership interest by the end of 2005. These payments consist of
the Companys share of remaining sinking fund payments currently required of Del-Tin Fiber, including the $17,500,000 contingent equity agreement and such payments for 2003 already accrued by the Company, but exclude any future operating
working capital needs of Del-Tin Fiber for which an amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to recent improvements in the plants production ability and to uncertainty of the timing of the sale of Deltics interest in the joint venture.
As natural gas prices escalated during the last half of
2000, the decision was made in late January 2001 to temporarily suspend operations of the facility until its heat energy system could be modified. Following completion of a capital project to modify the heat energy system, the plant resumed
operations in June 2001. Rectification of this system will enable Del-Tin Fibers operations to increase production levels closer to the plants capacity of 150 million square feet per year as market conditions improve. In addition 50 Table of Contents
DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 4Investment in Del-Tin Fiber cont. manufacturing cost per thousand square feet should be lower, as fixed costs for the facility are allocated to this increased production. Both owners
funded their respective share of the capital project. Under the operating agreement, Del-Tin Fibers employees operate the plant. Deltic has committed to provide a portion of the plants fiber and wood fuel supply at market prices. During 2002 and 2001, Deltic sold Del-Tin
Fiber approximately $3,018,000 and $1,924,000, respectively, of these lumber manufacturing by-products. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had a receivable from Del-Tin Fiber of $85,000 and $120,000, respectively. Del-Tin Fibers financial position at year-end 2002 and 2001 and

DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 4Investment in Del-Tin Fiber cont. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Companys share of the
underlying net assets of Del-Tin Fiber exceeded its investment by $14,433,000 and $229,000, respectively. The excess relates primarily to the Companys write-off of its carrying amount for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber as of December 31,
2002, and to interest received by the Company from Del-Tin Fiber prior to plant start-up, which was capitalized by Deltic as a reduction of its investment and was being amortized into income using the straight-line method over a 60-month period.
Del-Tin capitalized the interest paid to the Company into its property, plant, and equipment accounts, and it is being depreciated into the facilitys results of operations. The Company accounts for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber under the equity method. Accordingly, the investment in
Del-Tin Fiber is carried at cost, adjusted for the Companys proportionate share of undistributed earnings or losses. Cumulative net losses for the facility have amounted to $86,313,000, $43,156,500 net to the Company. As a result, no earnings
have been available for distribution to the owners. Contributions to Del-Tin Fiber by the Company as of December 31, 2002, have amounted to $57,708,000. Note 5Timber and Timberlands Timber and timberlands at December 31 consisted of the following:  Thousands of dollars

was $6,768,000, $6,257,000, and $5,926,000 in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, including charges to discontinued agriculture operations of $366,000 in 2000. Gains/losses on disposals or retirements of assets, exclusive of disposition of agricultural assets, included in
income were $15,000 in 2002, $57,000 in 2001, and $109,000 in 2000. Note 7Credit Facilities In
June 2001, Deltic entered into an agreement with SunTrust Bank and other domestic banks which provide an unsecured, committed revolving credit facility totaling $105,000,000. The agreement will expire on July 15, 2004. As of December 31, 2002 and
2001, $59,000,000 and $61,000,000, respectively, of committed credit was available in excess of all borrowings outstanding under the facility. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a base rate or at an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an
applicable margin, depending upon the type of loan the Company executes. The applicable margin component of the interest rate varies with the type of loan and the Companys total debt to EBITDA ratio. Borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002
and 2001, amounted to $46,000,000 and $44,000,000, respectively, and consisted of Eurodollar loans. Fees associated with this revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 175 to 35 percent per annum on the unused portion of the committed
amount. The revolving credit agreement contains restrictive covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of debt and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios. The Company may also borrow up to $1,000,000 under a short-term credit facility with BancorpSouth. The agreement
expires December 15, 2003, with renewal annually. The amount available to the Company under this facility is reduced by any borrowings by Deltic. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, Deltic had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit,
resulting in $1,000,000 available to the Company. Borrowings bear interest based upon the New York Prime, and the facility carries a commitment fee of 1 percent per annum on the unused amount of the facility. In addition, Deltic has an agreement with Regions Bank which provides a
$1,750,000 credit facility. The agreement, which is renewable annually, carries no facility fees and borrowings bear interest based upon prime. Amounts available to Deltic under the facility are reduced by any borrowings. The Company had no
borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2002 or 2001, leaving $1,750,000 available to the Company. For additional information regarding these financial instruments, see Note 12 Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

agreement with SunTrust Bank and a group of other domestic banks. The agreement will expire on July 15, 2004. The Company incurred costs of $520,000 related to the securing of this facility, which was deferred and is being amortized as additional
interest expense over the term of the agreement. During
1998, the Company successfully completed negotiation of the private placement of $40,000,000 of senior notes with Pacific Coast Farm Credit, a division of American AgCredit. These unsecured notes have a fixed stated interest rate of 67 percent and
mature on December 18, 2008. No installment payments are required, but the terms allow for prepayments at the option of the Company. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth
of the sum of $135,000,000, plus 25 percent of cumulative consolidated adjusted net income from October 1, 1998, and a maximum funded debt/capitalization ratio of 6 to 1. The Company incurred $226,000 of costs related to the issuance of these
notes, which was deferred and is being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In anticipation of issuance of these notes, the Company entered into and settled an interest rate hedge contract. Upon settlement
of this contract in December 1998, the Company paid $1,081,000, which was deferred and is being amortized as other debt expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective interest rate for these notes of approximately 69
percent. On December 20, 2002, Deltic successfully
completed the private placement of $30,000,000 of senior notes with Metropolitan Life and a group of other domestic insurance companies. These unsecured notes have a fixed stated interest rate of 601 percent and mature on December 20, 2012.
Semiannual installments of $3,333,333, or such lesser amount as shall be outstanding, are required beginning on December 20, 2008. The note terms allow for prepayment at the option of the Company in an amount of not less than five percent of the
principal amount outstanding at the time of any prepayment. The agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of the sum of $148,299,000, plus 25 percent of cumulative consolidated
adjusted net income from October 1, 2002, and a maximum consolidated debt to consolidated net capitalization ratio of 6 to 1. The Company incurred $179,000 of costs related to the issuance of these notes, which was deferred and is being amortized
as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt.

Net long-term
deferred tax liabilities were $11,955,000 at December 31, 2002, and $19,669,000 at December 31, 2001. In addition, short-term deferred tax assets of $685,000 at December 31, 2002, and $609,000 at December 31, 2001, are included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets for the respective years. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had valuation allowances of $2,142,000 and $957,000, respectively, to reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowances relate
to the deferred tax assets arising from state tax loss carryforwards. The net changes in the valuation allowances during 2002 and 2001 were increases of $1,185,000 and $957,000, respectively, and were principally due to the potential expiration of
net operating losses for state tax purposes. In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, Deltics management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the Companys total deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, management believes it
is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance, at December 31, 2002, as reductions of future taxable income or by utilizing available tax planning strategies. However,
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.

DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 10Income Taxes cont. At December 31, 2002, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for
state tax purposes of approximately $80,651,000. Of this amount, $14,000 expires in 2003, $1,402,000 expires in 2004, $34,162,000 expires in 2005, $21,696,000 expires in 2006, and $23,377,000 expires in 2007. The Company had expected federal tax
refunds of $1,556,000 and $1,985,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Receivables. The Company was part of the consolidated income tax return of its former parent, Murphy Oil, for periods prior to its spin-off on January 1, 1997.
Under the terms of a tax sharing agreement between the Company and Murphy Oil which governs tax matters for this period, Murphy Oil personnel handle the administration of any tax disputes. Murphy Oil has open years on its returns for years 1992,
1993, and 1994. During 2002, Murphy Oil closed the audit of its returns for 1995 and 1996 and paid Deltic a refund of $369,000. It is currently anticipated that the Company may have an additional net tax liability for the years 1992, 1993, and 1994
once these audits are closed. However, it is also anticipated that any amount of additional taxes owed to Murphy Oil for these periods will result in additional deferred tax assets related to its investment in real estate held for development and
sale. Therefore, such settlement should have no material impact on total income tax expense/benefit. Note 11Stockholders Rights Plan The Company has a Stockholders Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible common shareholder to receive a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right Right for each outstanding share of the Companys
common stock held. The Rights will expire on December 31, 2006, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed. The Rights will detach from the common stock and become exercisable: 1 following a specified period of time after the date of the first public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons Acquiring Person, other than certain persons, has become the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys common stock or 2 following a specified
amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Acquiring Person, other than certain persons, which would, if consummated, result in such persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the Companys
common stock. In either case, the detachment of the Rights from the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the Company. The Rights have certain antitakeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to any Acquiring
Person that attempts to acquire the Company without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being acquired. The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover, but rather are designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors
of the Company to negotiate with an acquiror on behalf of all the shareholders. Other terms of the Rights are set forth in, and the foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by, the Rights Agreement between the Company and Harris Trust and
Savings Bank, as Rights Agent.

values of financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2002 and 2001. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The table excludes
financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities, except the current portion of noncurrent notes receivable and current maturities of long-term debt, all of which have fair values approximating carrying values.  2002 2001 Thousands of dollars

receivable, including current portionThe carrying value is estimated to approximate fair value based on the change in interest rates spread since the notes obligation dates. Long-term debt, including current maturitiesThe fair value is estimated based on current rates at which the Company
could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities. Redeemable preferred stockThe fair value is based
on the redemption amount for the stock, discounted using the Companys estimated borrowing rate for debt instruments with similar remaining maturities. Guarantees and letters of creditThe fair value is based on the estimated cost to settle these obligations.
Note 13Concentration of Credit Risks Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit
risk are trade accounts receivable. These receivables normally arise from the sale of wood products and real estate. Concentration of credit with respect to these trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers comprising
the Companys customer base. No single customer accounted for a significant amount of the Companys sales of wood products or real estate in 2002, 2001, or 2000. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no significant accounts receivable
from a single customer.

Retirement PlansFor the Companys qualified plan, the projected benefit obligation PBO exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $2,909,000 at December 31, 2002; however, the fair value of plan assets
exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation ABO at year-end by $1,525,000. Therefore, no recognition of a minimum pension liability was required for the qualified plan. The Company does not fund its nonqualified plan; therefore, this
plan has no assets. At year-end 2002 and 2001, the PBO for this nonqualified plan was $983,000 and $800,000, respectively. The Company recorded a liability equal to the nonqualified plans ABO of $705,000 at December 31, 2002, and $624,000 at
December 31, 2001, which is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Noncurrent Liabilities. Other Postretirement BenefitsThe Company sponsors a plan that provides comprehensive health care benefits
supplementing Medicare benefits for those eligible and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Costs are accrued for this plan during the service lives of covered employees. Retirees contribute a portion of the self-funded cost of health
care benefits; the Company contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life insurance coverage, arranged through an insurance company. The health care plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company retains the right to modify or
terminate the benefits and/or cost sharing provisions. In
determining the benefit obligation for health care at December 31, 2002, health care inflation cost was assumed to increase at an annual rate of 75 percent in 2002, increasing to 10 percent in 2003 and then decreasing one percent per year to 5
percent in 2008 and thereafter. A one percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend would increase the aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit cost for 2002 by $76,000 and the benefit obligation by
$549,000, while a one 
60 Table of Contents
DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 14Employee and Retiree Benefit Plans cont. percentage-point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease the 2002
cost components by $68,000 and the benefit obligation by $503,000. Thrift PlanEmployees of the Company may participate in
its thrift plan by allotting up to a specific percentage of their base pay. The Company matches contributions at a stated percentage of each employees allotment, based on length of participation in the plan. Company contributions to this plan
were $290,000 in 2002, $275,000 in 2001, and $281,000 in 2000. Note
15Incentive Plans Stock Incentive Plan On April 25, 2002, the Companys shareholders approved the Deltic
Timber Corporation 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. The 2002 Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan, which was terminated. At December 31, 2002, remaining outstanding options under the 1996 Plan
totaled 331,680 shares, of which 242,955 shares were exercisable. No further awards will be made under the 1996 Plan, and the unexercisable outstanding options will be fully vested by the end of the first quarter of 2004. Outstanding options under
the 1996 Plan will expire from 2006 to 2011 if not exercised and have an average exercise price of $2431 based on the fair market value at date of grant. The 2002 Plan permits annual awards of shares of the Companys common stock to executives, other key employees, and directors. Under the plan,
the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee is authorized to grant: 1 stock options; 2 restricted stock and restricted stock units; 3 performance units; and 4 other stock-based awards, including stock appreciation rights
and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2002 Plan is 1,800,000 shares unless adjustment is determined necessary by the Committee as the result of dividend or other distribution,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of common stock, or other corporate transaction in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of
benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available. At December 31, 2002, 1,637,750 of these 1,800,000 shares were available for award under the 2002 Plan. No participant in the 2002 Plan may receive options and stock appreciation rights
in any calendar year that relates to more than 50,000 shares, and the maximum number of shares which may be awarded as restricted stock and restricted stock units or other stock-based awards is 180,000 shares. The Company applies the intrinsic value
method of APB 25 to account for stock-based compensation, accruing costs of any stock options and restricted stock over the respective vesting/performance periods. The cost of stock-based compensation is reflected in General and Administrative
Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and amounted to $664,000 in 2002, $618,000 in 2001, and $442,000 in 2000. For additional information regarding the Companys stock-based compensation, including the effect on net income/loss
and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, see Note 1Significant Accounting Policies. Stock OptionsFor each option granted under the 2002 Plan, the Committee fixes the option price at not less than fair
market value on the date of the grant and the option term, not to exceed 10 years from date of grant. Options granted in 2002 were awarded in February 2002 subject to shareholder approval in April. As a result of an increase in the market value of
the Companys common stock from the grant date to the approval date, these options have an intrinsic value of $346 per share. The resulting fixed stocked-based compensation cost is being accrued over the vesting period for these options.
Replacement options granted due to the spin-off from Murphy Oil were for 10 years from original grant

DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 15Incentive Plans cont. date and nonqualified. New options granted in 1997 and 1998 were for 10 years and primarily incentive. Options granted since 1998 have been for 10
years and nonqualified. All options have an option price not less than the market value on the grant date, with a range in option prices of $990 to $29295 per share. For options granted in 1997, exclusive of replacement options, half could be
exercised or surrendered after two years and the remainder after three years. For options granted from 1998 through 2001, half could be exercised or surrendered after one year and the remainder after three years. During 2002, the Company granted
options for 162,250 shares. For 122,250 shares, half may be exercised or surrendered after one year and the remainder after three years, and the remaining 40,000 shares, awarded to nonemployee directors at an option price of $29295, were vested
immediately when awarded. Changes in options outstanding,

Sheets as Unamortized Restricted Stock Awards, and is being amortized to expense over the respective four-year restricted period. Performance UnitsPerformance units granted under the 2002 Plan may be denominated in cash, common shares, other
securities, other awards allowed under the 2002 Plan, or other property and shall confer on the holder thereof rights valued as determined by the Committee and payable to, or exercisable by, the holder, in whole or in part, upon achievement of such
performance goals during such performance periods as the Committee shall establish. Subject to the terms of the 2002 Plan, the performance goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period, the amount of any
performance unit granted, and any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any performance unit shall be determined by the Committee. No performance units have been granted. Other Stock-based AwardsThe Committee may also grant
other awards, including but not limited to, stock appreciation rights and rights to dividends and dividend equivalents that are denominated, or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to shares of the
Companys common stock, including securities convertible in its common stock, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the 2002 Plan. No such other stock-based awards have been granted. Incentive Compensation Plan Cash AwardsThe Company has an Incentive
Compensation Plan that provides for annual cash awards to officers, directors, and key employees based on actual results for a year compared to objectives established by the Executive Compensation Committee, which administers the Plan, at the
beginning of that year. Provisions for cash incentive awards of $358,000, $405,000, and $722,000 were recorded in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

timberlands, including $8,327,000 for the purchase of 4,979 acres of Southern Pine timberland which closed in January 2003; $1,248,000 for property, plant, and equipment; and $3,589,000 for investment in real estate held for development and
sale. ContingenciesThe
Company has various contingencies related to its investment in Del-Tin Fiber and has either recorded such contingencies into its financial statements or disclosed the conditions of the contingency as required by SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies.
For the details of these contingencies, see Note 4 Investment in Del-Tin Fiber. The Company is also involved in litigation incidental to its business from time to time. Currently, there are no material legal proceedings outstanding.

DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2002 Note 19Business Segments The Companys four reporting segments consist of Deltics
three operating business units and its corporate function. Each reporting entity has a separate management team and infrastructure that offers different products and/or services. Woodlands operations manage the Companys Southern Pine timberlands located primarily in Arkansas and north
Louisiana and derive revenue from the harvest of timber from the timberlands, in accordance with its harvest plans, and either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Companys Mills segment for conversion into lumber. In
addition, this segment may, from time to time, identify and sell a portion of its timberland holdings that is either non-strategic to future timberland management activities or has appreciated, due primarily to location, to a level that exceeds its
value as a timber-growing asset. This segment also generates revenue from the leasing of hunting, oil and gas, and other rights on its timberlands. The Mills segment consists of Deltics two sawmills which convert timber, purchased from third parties or the Companys Woodlands segment,
into lumber. These mills produce a variety of products, including dimension lumber, boards, timbers, decking, and secondary manufacturing products, such as finger-jointed studs. These products are sold primarily to wholesalers and lumber treaters in
the South and Midwest and used in residential construction, roof trusses, laminated beams, and remanufactured items. Real Estate operations, which currently include three separate real estate developments, add value to former timberland by developing it into
upscale, planned residential and commercial developments. These developments, each of which is centered around a core amenity, are being developed in stages. To-date, real estate sales have consisted primarily of residential lots sold to builders or
individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of undeveloped acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail and office space to third parties in a retail center constructed by the Company, and held for sale, in one of its developments.
This segment also manages: 1 a real estate brokerage subsidiary which currently generates commission revenue by reselling existing homesites in one of the Company developments and 2 a country club operation, Chenal Country Club, Inc., around
which the Companys Chenal Valley development is centered. This club operation derives its revenues from membership services, food and beverage sales, and membership dues. Corporate operations consist primarily of senior management, planning, accounting, information systems, human
resources, treasury, income tax, and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units. The Company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units. In August 2000, the Companys Board of Directors approved the

REPORT OF
MANAGEMENT The Shareholders Deltic Timber Corporation: The management of Deltic Timber Corporation has prepared and is responsible for the Companys consolidated financial statements. The statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management has, when necessary, made judgments and estimates with consideration given to materiality. The Company has established and maintains a disclosure control system and related
policies and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known. In addition, the Company maintains internal control systems and related policies and procedures
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use, that the accounting records accurately reflect business transactions, and that the transactions are in accordance with managements
authorization. The design, monitoring, and revision of the systems of internal control involve, among other things, our judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The Company also maintains an
internal auditing function which monitors the effectiveness of the controls, while independently and systematically evaluating and formally reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of components of the system. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP,
independent certified public accountants, who have expressed their opinion with respect to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Their audit was conducted in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which include the consideration of the Companys internal controls to the extent necessary to form an independent opinion on the consolidated financial statements
prepared by management. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the Audit Committee appoints the independent auditors; ratification of the appointment is solicited annually from the shareholders. The Audit Committee is composed of directors who are not officers or employees of the
Company. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the certified public accountants, the Companys internal auditor, and representatives of management to review the Companys internal controls, the quality of its financial reporting, the
scope and results of audits, and the independence of the external auditors. The Companys internal auditor and KPMG LLP have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, without managements presence, to discuss audit findings and other
financial matters. /s/Clefton D. Vaughan Clefton D. Vaughan Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

INDEPENDENT
AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors Deltic Timber Corporation: We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. The consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Deltic Timber
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. /s/KPMG LLP

AUDIT COMMITTEE
CHAIRMANS LETTER The Shareholders Deltic Timber Corporation: The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee is responsible for providing independent oversight of the Companys accounting functions and internal controls. The members of the
Committee are selected by the Board of Directors. The Committee consists of five outside directors and operates under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors. A copy of this charter is included in the proxy statement for the
Companys 2001 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Committee met five times during 2002. The Committee also oversees the financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. As part of this responsibility, the Committee assessed the independence of the Companys external auditors, utilizing
written disclosures received from such auditors as required by the provisions adopted by the Independence Standards Board, and recommended to the Board of Directors, subject to shareholder approval, the selection of the Companys external
auditors. The Committee discussed the overall scope and specific plans for audit services with the Companys internal auditor and with KPMG LLP, the Companys external auditors. The Committee reviewed and discussed the quarterly financial
statements prior to the filing of the Companys Form 10-Qs. In addition, the Committee also reviewed and discussed the Companys audited consolidated financial statements and adequacy of the Companys internal controls and
discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required by Statements on Auditing Standards 61, Communication with Audit Committees. The Committee also met with the internal auditor and KPMG LLP to discuss the results of their respective audits, their
consideration of the Companys internal controls, and the overall quality of the Companys financial reporting. The meetings were also designed to facilitate any private communication with the Committee, without management present, desired
by the internal auditor or KPMG LLP. Based upon these reviews and
discussions, the Committee approved the accompanying audited financial statements for inclusion in the annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. /s/John C. Shealy John C. Shealy Chairman, Audit Committee March 5, 2003

Such evaluation was under the supervision, and with the participation, of the Companys senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and the Chief Financial Officer CFO. Based on this evaluation, the
Companys CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in any reports that the Company files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, such controls have been deemed to be effective in ensuring that the required information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. There have
been no significant changes in internal controls or in any other factors that could significantly affect those internal controls subsequent to the date of their last evaluation.
