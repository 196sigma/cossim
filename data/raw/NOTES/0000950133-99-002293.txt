ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of BTG, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BTG, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity, cash flows, and comprehensive
income for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 1999.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BTG, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March
31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. s/ KPMG LLP McLean, Virginia

BTG, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997
1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS
BTG, Inc. BTG or the Company is an information systems and technical
services company providing expertise to a broad range of the complex systems
needs of its customers. The Company is an industry leader in providing systems
analysis and engineering services, solutions development, systems integration,
and computer-based operations and support.
2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
unconsolidated affiliates owned more than 20 percent, but not in excess of 50
percent, are recorded on the equity method.
Revenue Recognition
The Company provides systems development, integration and engineering
services, primarily to the United States Government and its agencies and
departments the Government, on a contractual basis. Revenue on cost-plus-fee
contracts is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate
amount of fees earned. Revenue on time-and-materials contracts is recognized to
the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus other direct costs.
Revenue on fixed-price contracts is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total
estimated costs. Anticipated contract losses are recognized as soon as they
become known and estimable.
Revenue that is contractually billable prior to performance or delivery is
deferred until the work has been performed and/or the product has been
delivered.
The Company also provides off-the-shelf hardware and software to the
Government under a variety of contract vehicles and to commercial companies as a
third-party distributor. Related revenue is recognized when products are shipped
or when customers have accepted the products or services, depending on
contractual terms. Estimated future costs of providing customer support under
warranty obligations for products sold by the Company are recorded at the time
of revenue recognition.
Cash and Equivalents
All highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three
months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
Investments
Investments in marketable debt and equity securities are accounted for
under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities Statement
115. At March 31, 1998, the Company short-term investments consisted solely
of marketable equity securities which were classified as available for sale in
accordance with the provisions of Statement 115. Accordingly, such investments
are carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Fair value was determined based on quoted market prices. Net unrealized gains
from these investments were carried as a separate component of shareholders'
equity, net of the related tax effects. At March 31, 1999, the Company held no
investments in marketable debt or equity securities.
Inventory
Inventory, net of an allowance for obsolescence, consists principally of
purchased products held for resale and is valued at the lower of cost,
determined on the average cost basis, or market value.
27
28
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives, three to seven years, using accelerated and
straight-line methods. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of
the related leases using the straight-line method. Assets recorded under capital
leases are amortized using the straight-line method over either the lease term
or the estimated useful lives of the leased assets depending on the criteria
used for lease capitalization.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill, the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets of acquired companies, is amortized over the
expected periods of benefit, 20 to 30 years, on a straight-line basis.
Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods of benefit, three to 13 years.
The Company assesses the recoverability of its goodwill and intangible
assets by determining whether the balances can be recovered through the
estimated, undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operations.
The amount of impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted
future operating cash flows. The assessment of the recoverability of goodwill
and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows
are not achieved.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.
Research and Development Expenses
The Company expenses research and development costs as they are incurred.
Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997 were not significant.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of the Company receivables, payables, and revolving
line of credit instruments approximates fair value since all such instruments
are either short-term in nature or bear interest rates which are indexed to
current market rates. Fair value for the Company notes receivable and
long-term debt is determined based on current rates offered for instruments with
similar remaining maturities. At March 31, 1999, the carrying value of the
Company notes receivable and long-term debt approximated fair value.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the year
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the year
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential dilutive
securities outstanding during the year. Potential dilutive securities include
all issued and outstanding options and warrants.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The
Company uses the most current and best available information in preparing its
estimates. Significant estimates were used in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements to account for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance,
product warranty liability, and certain other reserves recorded in connection
with the restructuring charge recognized in both fiscal 1999 and 1998. Actual
results may differ from those estimates.
28
29
Comprehensive Income
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
Statement 130. Statement 130 established standards for reporting and
presenting comprehensive income and its components in consolidated financial
statements. The Company only element of comprehensive income during fiscal
1999, 1998 and 1997 related to unrealized gains on investments held at March 31,
1998. These gains were realized during fiscal 1999. The Company adopted
Statement 130 effective April 1, 1998.
Segment Reporting
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
Statement 131. The Company adopted Statement 131 during its fiscal 1999.
Statement 131 establishes new procedures and requirements for the i
determination of business segments, ii presentation and disclosure of segment
information, and iii disclosure of selected segment information within interim
consolidated financial statements. Business segments, as defined in Statement
131, are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is
available and is evaluated regularly by the Company in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The financial information is required to
be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating the segment
performance.
Reclassification
Certain amounts in the prior years' financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the fiscal 1999 presentation.
3.  RECEIVABLES

Net deferred tax asset                   $  3,822  $  4,048
There was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of April 1,
1997. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred
tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management
considers taxes paid during the previous three years, scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and
tax planning strategies which can be implemented by the Company in making this
assessment. Based upon these factors, the Company has established a valuation
allowance against that portion of the deferred tax assets for which management
believes that ultimate realization cannot presently be assessed as more likely
than not. Operating losses incurred in fiscal 1998 were primarily the result of
divested and discontinued operations for which no future losses are anticipated.
Management believes that, based principally on the past earnings history of its
ongoing operations and the scheduled reversal of significant deferred tax
liabilities, the majority of its deferred tax assets at March 31, 1999 are more
likely than not realizable.
7.  LINE OF CREDIT
In November 1995, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit
facility the Credit Facility with a syndicate of financial institutions
which provided for borrowings up to $600 million based on specified percentages
of eligible accounts receivable the borrowing base. In October 1996, and
again in October 1997, the Credit Facility was amended to increase the ceiling
for available borrowings to $850 million and $1100 million, respectively. In
February 1998, in connection with the divestiture of the Company product
reselling business, the Credit Facility was further amended to reduce the
ceiling for available borrowings to $950 million through March 31, 1998, $850
million from April 1, 1998 through June 30, 1998, $750 million from July 1,
1998 through September 30, 1998, and $600 million from October 1, 1998 through
August 31, 1999. On November 9, 1998, the Company again amended its Credit
Facility to provide for, among other things, an extension of the maturity date
of the facility to August 31, 2002 and a further reduction, to a $500 million
ceiling, in available borrowings under the facility. At March 31, 1999, the
balance outstanding under the Credit Facility was approximately $177 million
and approximately $176 million was available for additional borrowing. At March
31, 1998, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility were in excess of the
amounts available under the prescribed borrowing base by approximately $151
million and the Company obtained approval from the lending financial
institutions for overadvance funding to cover such excess borrowings. Interest
on outstanding borrowings under the amended agreement is provided at a rate
equal to, at the Company option, either the lender prime rate or LIBOR plus
a percentage ranging from 225% to 325%, depending on the Company leverage
ratio. During the period the Company was utilizing overadvance funding, all
outstanding borrowings accrued interest at the lender prime rate.
31
32
The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company.
The Company is required to comply with various financial covenants under the
Credit Facility and is restricted from, among other things, paying dividends,
changing its capital structure, or making acquisitions without the approval of
the lenders. At March 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance with all financial
covenants under the Credit Facility. At March 31, 1998, the Company obtained
waivers from the lending financial institutions for non-compliance with certain
of the financial covenants. At March 31, 1999, the entire balance outstanding
under the Credit Facility has been classified as a noncurrent liability in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet, as the Company anticipates that its
borrowing base over the next fiscal year will provide for a minimum availability
equal to or in excess of the amount outstanding on such date.
In addition to a revolving loan, the Credit Facility includes a facility
under which the Company can, subject to the approval of the lender and the
payment of certain fees, obtain letters of credit of up to a maximum of $50
million. At March 31, 1999 and 1998, there were no letters of credit outstanding
under the facility. Costs incurred to obtain the Credit Facility have been
capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the agreement.
An analysis of activity under the Credit Facility is as follows in

$34 million to the financial institutions that lend to the Company under the
Credit Facility. The proceeds from the term promissory notes were used to
finance the acquisition of STAC, Inc. In March 1999, the Company repaid $17
million of the notes.

On February 24, 1998, the Company issued two term promissory notes, each
in the amount of $75 million, to the financial institutions that lend to the
Company under the Credit Facility. In April 1998, the Company repaid the term
promissory notes with proceeds from the sale of investments. The funds initially
received from the issuance of the term promissory notes were used for the early
retirement of other outstanding notes payable. Total costs incurred by the
Company in connection with such early retirement amounted to approximately $19
million, net of the related tax benefits, and are presented as an extraordinary
item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS
Preferred Stock
The Company Amended Articles of Incorporation authorize the Company to
issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, 982,500 of which have no par

been issued as of March 31, 1999.
Common Stock
The Company has one class of voting common stock with 20,000,000 shares
authorized for issuance. In November 1996, the Company sold 2,190,000 shares of

total proceeds of $331 million, net of issuance costs of approximately $25
million.
Treasury Stock
In September 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved the adoption
of a share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the share repurchase plan, the

Stock Purchase Plans
In August 1995, the Company shareholders adopted i the Annual Leave
Stock Plan the Annual Leave Plan and ii the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the ESPP. Under the Annual Leave Plan, eligible employees are permitted to
exchange certain unused amounts of accrued annual leave for shares of common
stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date of exchange. During
fiscal 1999, 13,264 shares of common stock, valued at approximately $75,000,
were issued under the Annual Leave Plan. During fiscal 1998, 11,944 shares of
common stock, valued at approximately $111,000 were issued under the Annual
Leave Plan. During fiscal 1997, 11,355 shares of common stock, valued at
approximately $202,000 were issued under the Annual Leave Plan.
Under the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company who elect to participate
are permitted to purchase common stock of the Company, through payroll
deductions, at a 15 percent discount to the lower of the fair market value of
such stock at the beginning or ending date of the quarterly election period.
Under its original terms, the total number of shares of common stock that were
issuable under the ESPP was 150,000, limited to 12,500 per fiscal quarter. In
August 1996, the Company shareholders approved an amendment to the ESPP which
i increased the total number of shares of common stock issuable under the ESPP
to 400,000; ii eliminated the quarterly purchase limitation; and iii added a
provision to allow for annual lump sum contributions. A total of 72,882, 75,854
and 55,080 common stock shares were issued under the ESPP during fiscal 1999,
1998 and 1997, respectively.
On October 15, 1996, the Company adopted, subject to the approval of the
Company shareholders, the Non-Employee Director Stock Purchase Plan the
Directors Purchase Plan. Under the terms of the Directors Purchase Plan,
non-employee members of the Board of Directors may elect to have their fees
invested in BTG common stock at a price equal to the lower of 100% of the fair
market value of a Company share on the beginning or ending date of the election
period. The election period is the 12-month period beginning on October 1 of
each year. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Directors
Purchase Plan is 100,000. The Company shareholders approved the Directors
Purchase Plan in August 1997. During fiscal 1999, 18,961 shares of
34
35
common stock, valued at approximately $128,000, were issued under the Directors
Purchase Plan. During fiscal 1998, 6,068 shares of common stock, valued at
approximately $85,000, were issued under the Directors Purchase Plan. No shares
of common stock were issued under the Directors Purchase Plan during fiscal
1997.
Profit Sharing Plan
The Company established a qualified 401k profit sharing plan in 1987
under which eligible employees may elect to defer a portion of their salary. At
the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company may contribute to the
plan. The current contribution, as approved by the Board, is a matching
contribution of an amount up to five percent of eligible employees' deferrals.
Employees participating in the plan vest in the employer contribution over four
years at 10%, 30%, 60%, and 100% cumulative per year, respectively.
Company contributions to the 401k plan were approximately $16 million 20 million, and $16 million in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Disclosures Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 and its related
interpretations in accounting for its equity participation programs.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its incentive stock
option plans and its stock purchase plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value
at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of
accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company net income and earnings per share

11.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
In fiscal 1998, the Company Board of Directors approved a restructuring
plan designed to refocus the Company on its core business and historical
strengths in order to improve operating results. Pursuant to this plan, the
Company consummated, in February 1998, the divestiture of substantially all of
the BTG operating division the Division responsible for the reselling of
computer hardware and software products. In addition, the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of approximately $385 million associated with such
divestiture.

At March 31, 1998, the Company had outstanding accruals and reserves of
approximately $146 million for restructuring costs established during fiscal
1998. During fiscal 1999, approximately $75 million of these accruals and
reserves were utilized against the estimated impairment of retained Division
assets, the reserve established for facility and operating lease commitments,
accrued employee severance costs, and certain other accrued reserves. An
additional charge of $18 million, related to an adjustment to the estimated
impairment of retained Division assets and additional facility costs, was
recorded during fiscal 1999. At March 31, 1999, the Company had remaining
restructuring accruals and reserves outstanding of approximately $89 million.
12.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the year ended March 31, 1999, the Company Board of Directors
approved a management plan to dispose of a retail computer store operated by the
Company. In connection with this discontinued operation, the Company recorded
losses of approximately $717,000, net of the related income tax benefit, during
fiscal 1999.
During the year ended March 31, 1997, the Company formed a new subsidiary,
Community Networks, Inc. CNI, for the purpose of providing local communities
with high-speed Internet access, specialized intranets, and electronic commerce
capability on a subscriber fee-based model. The subscriber base did not grow as
rapidly as was initially anticipated and the Company discontinued the operations
of CNI during fiscal 1998. As a result, losses of approximately $42 million,
net of the related income tax benefit, were recognized during fiscal 1998.
Net losses from the Company discontinued operations have been segregated
from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the
consolidated statements of operations. Prior year reported results have been
reclassified in order to provide for consistent presentation.

WheelGroup Corporation
In May 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with WheelGroup
Corporation WheelGroup under which it i purchased 214,042 shares of the
outstanding common stock of WheelGroup for $200,000; ii purchased a
convertible note receivable
37
38
from WheelGroup for $300,000; and iii committed to the purchase of certain
distribution rights and consulting services from WheelGroup for approximately $1
million, payable in various installments over fiscal years 1997 and 1998. As the
result of a significant investment in WheelGroup by a venture capital fund, BTG
was given the option, in March 1997, to purchase an additional 28,146 shares of
WheelGroup for $987 per share. As a result, $277,799 of amounts previously paid
to WheelGroup under the distribution rights and consulting services agreement
were used to purchase the additional 28,146 shares.
In March 1998, pursuant to a merger agreement entered into by WheelGroup
and Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco, a publicly-traded technology company, the
Company ownership interests in WheelGroup were converted into approximately
326,000 common shares of Cisco. The shares of Cisco initially received by BTG
were unregistered; however, in accordance with the merger agreement, were
registered shortly after the merger was consummated. In connection with the sale
of its WheelGroup interests, the Company recorded a gain in fiscal 1998 of
approximately $202 million calculated using the fair market value of Cisco
common stock on the date of closing of the merger. At March 31, 1998, the
Company had classified its Cisco investment as available for sale in
accordance with the provisions of Statement 115. Accordingly, such investment
was carried at fair value, determined on quoted market prices, in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. The net unrealized gain from
this investment was carried as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net
of the related tax effects. In fiscal 1999, the Company sold all of its Cisco
shares for approximately $255 million and used the proceeds from these sales to
retire outstanding debt. Gains of approximately $42 million were recognized
during fiscal 1999 as a result of these sales.
Government Technology Services, Inc.
On February 12, 1998, BTG and Government Technology Services, Inc.
GTSI entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement the APA under which BTG
completed the sale to GTSI of i certain of the assets, principally inventory
and property and equipment, and ii certain of the existing contracts and
outstanding customer orders of the BTG operating division responsible for
reselling computer hardware and software products. In addition, GTSI hired a
significant number of the individuals previously employed by BTG in this
division. As consideration for the sale, BTG initially received $80 million and
15,375 shares of a new series of preferred stock of GTSI, designated Series C 8%
cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock. Ten percent of the purchase
price was placed in escrow for a one-year period to serve as security for the
Company indemnification for potential obligations under the acquisition
agreement. Pursuant to the acquisition agreement, the preferred stock received
by the Company converted into 3,000,000 shares of GTSI common stock once
approved by the GTSI shareholders on May 12, 1998. In July 1998, the Company
sold 11 million shares of its GTSI holdings for $50 million, resulting in a
loss of approximately $440,000.
In February 1999, BTG and GTSI entered into a series of agreements in
order to settle a number of issues which arose subsequent to the APA. Under the
terms of the new agreements, BTG transferred to GTSI all of the cash portion of
the escrow and 200,000 shares of the GTSI common stock being held in the escrow.
In addition, BTG granted GTSI the option to purchase, at a per-share price of
$525, the remaining GTSI shares held by BTG. This option has a term of five
years; however, BTG has the right to sell its shares to an unrelated third party
with the consent of GTSI. Upon a sale of these shares during the option term to
any party other than GTSI, the agreement obligates BTG to pay GTSI a per-share
amount of $050. In addition, as part of the February 1999 agreements, BTG
agreed to novate to GTSI certain contracts awarded to BTG product reselling
division in a prior year. During fiscal 1999, approximately $936 million of
product sales revenue was recognized by BTG from these contracts under which
GTSI was used as the subcontractor. An unusual charge of approximately $12
million was recognized by the Company during fiscal 1999 as a result of these
agreements.
Also in February 1999, BTG and GTSI entered into an agreement under which
GTSI issued a note payable to BTG as consideration for the purchase by GTSI of
400,000 shares of the GTSI common stock held by BTG. These shares were sold at
$500 per share. The note, which bears interest at 80%, is payable in three
annual installments beginning on January 31, 2000. During fiscal 1999, the
Company recognized interest income of approximately $21,000 from this note.
The 13 million and 30 million shares of GTSI common stock held by BTG at
March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, have been classified as restricted
investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. BTG investment in
GTSI at March 31, 1999 represents less than 20% of GTSI outstanding shares and
BTG does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the
operating or financial policies of GTSI. Accordingly, the Company carries this
investment at cost.                    38

14.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
On January 26, 1999, BTG completed the acquisition of STAC, Inc. STAC
an analysis and software development company headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia.
The Company purchased all of the common stock of STAC for approximately $64
million, $15 million of which was contingent on certain stock market indices
which were subsequently satisfied. The Company has accounted for this
acquisition using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly, the results
of operations of STAC have been included in the Company consolidated statement
of operations since the date of the acquisition. The purchase price was
allocated to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities
based on preliminary estimates of fair value as of the date of acquisition. The
excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired of approximately $68
million was allocated to goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the expected period of benefit, 20 years. The final allocation of the
purchase price will be determined during the subsequent fiscal year when
preliminary studies and other estimates are finalized. In addition, the Company
entered into retention agreements with certain former employees of STAC which
provide for an aggregate payment of up to $700,000 over a three-year period if
the employees remain with BTG. This acquisition does not have a material effect
on pro forma operations.
In June 1997, the Company acquired, for $100 million in cash, all of the
outstanding capital stock of Nations, Inc. Nations, a systems engineering
and software development company headquartered in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. The
acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
accordingly, the results of operations of Nations have been included in the
Company consolidated statement of operations since the date of acquisition,
June 12, 1997. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of approximately $69
million has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the expected period of benefit, 30 years. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company also entered into both non-compete and employment
agreements with several members of Nations' senior management.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the
combined results of operations of the Company and Nations as if the acquisition
had occurred as of the beginning of the fiscal years ended March 31, 1998 and
1997. The pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect the
results of operations that would have occurred had the Company and Nations
constituted a single entity during such periods.                                      FISCAL YEARS ENDED

BTG agreed to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of M-T-M for cash and
common stock consideration valued at approximately $250 million. On February
13, 1998, the Agreement, as subsequently amended, was terminated. Pursuant to
the Agreement, BTG paid M-T-M a $500,000 termination fee. In addition, the
Company paid M-T-M $125 million for additional out-of-pocket expenses and in
exchange for a release from future liability which may arise as a result of the
termination of the Agreement. Total costs incurred in connection with this
merger and acquisition transaction during fiscal 1998 were approximately $24
million and are included in other non-operating expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.

Government contracts are provisional payments which are subject to adjustment
upon audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency or other regulatory agency.
Audits through fiscal 1996 have

been completed and final rates have been established. Audits for 1997 and
subsequent years are not expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial position.
Litigation and Claims
The Company is a party to various legal actions and claims resulting from
the normal course of business. Although the total amount of liability, if any,
with respect to these matters cannot be ascertained, management of the Company
believes that any resulting liability should not have a material effect on the
Company consolidated financial position or future results of operations.
Leases
The Company leases office space and equipment under certain operating
lease agreements expiring at various dates through June 2012. Most leases
include provisions for periodic rent escalations based on changes in various
economic indices. Rent expense in fiscal 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $63 million 89 million, and $59 million, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments on non-cancelable operating leases,
including sublease commitments, were as follows on March 31, 1999 in

17.  SEGMENT REPORTING
Under Statement 131, BTG has two reportable segments: the Systems Business
and the Product Reselling Business. The Company provides systems development,
integration, engineering and network design, and security expertise services
under the Systems Business. Under the Product Reselling Business, the Company
resells computer hardware and software. The accounting policies of these
segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. In February 1998, pursuant to a restructuring plan approved
by BTG Board of Directors, the Company began to phase out its operating
activities in the Product Reselling Business. Accordingly, the Company does not
anticipate significant operating activity in the Product Reselling Business
segment in future periods.
Selected financial data for the Company operating segments is summarized
