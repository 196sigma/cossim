23 MANAGEMENTS
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f. Our
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. The scope of managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting includes the
Companys consolidated subsidiaries, except for certain businesses acquired by
the Company on November 18, 2005 and February 8, 2006, respectively, as
permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Companys consolidated
net sales for the year ended March31, 2006 were $8790 million, of which
the certain businesses acquired by the Company on November 18, 2005 and
February 8, 2006, respectively, represented $52 million. The Companys consolidated total assets as of
March31, 2006 were $6113 million, of which the certain businesses
acquired by the Company on November 18, 2005 and February 8, 2006,
respectively, represented $273 million. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31,
2006. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of March31, 2006 has been audited by KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included on page 26. 24 Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. and subsidiaries as of March31, 2006 and 2005, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2006.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Consolidated
Graphics, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March31, 2006 and 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended March31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Consolidated
Graphics, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of March31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated
June7, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment
of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

25 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. We
have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Consolidated Graphics, Inc. the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our
opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of March31, 2006, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
March31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by COSO. The
Company acquired certain businesses on November 18, 2005 and February 8, 2006,
and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of its
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, the certain
businesses internal control over financial reporting associated with the total
assets of $273 million, and total revenues of $52 million included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries as of and for
the year ended March 31, 2006. Our audit of internal control over
financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of the certain businesses. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company and its subsidiaries as of March31, 2006 and 2005, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2006, and
our report dated June7, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages 1. BUSINESS Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries referred
to as the Company is a leading national provider of commercial printing
services and is recognized as the largest sheetfed and digital commercial
printing company in the United States. The Company is focused on adding value
to its printing businesses by providing the financial and operational
strengths, management support and technological advantages associated with a
national organization. The
Companys printing businesses maintain their own sales, customer service,
estimating and planning, prepress, production and accounting departments. The
Companys corporate headquarters staff provides support to its printing
businesses in such areas as human resources, purchasing and management
information systems. The Company also maintains centralized treasury, risk
management, tax and consolidated financial reporting activities. The
Companys sales are derived from commercial printing services. These services
consist of itraditional print services, including electronic prepress,
digital and offset printing, finishing, storage and delivery of high-quality
printed documents which are custom manufactured to the design specifications of
the Companys customers; iifulfillment and mailing services for such
printed materials, and iii digital technology solutions and e-commerce
capabilities that enable the Companys customers to more efficiently procure
and manage printed materials and/or design, procure, distribute, track and
analyze results of printing-based marketing programs and activities. The
scope and extent of services provided to the Companys customers typically
varies for each individual order it receives, depending on customer-specific
factors including the intended uses for the printed materials. Furthermore,
each of the Companys locations generally is capable of providing a complete
range of services to its customers.
Accordingly, the Company does not operate its business in a manner that
differentiates among its respective capabilities and services for financial or
management reporting purposes, rather each of its printing businesses define a
distinct reporting unit. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER INFORMATION Accounting Policies The
accounting policies of the Company reflect industry practices and conform to
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The more
significant of such accounting policies are described below. Principles of ConsolidationThe accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No131, Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information, the Companys operations
constitute one reportable segment because all of its printing businesses
operate in the commercial printing industry and exhibit similar economic
characteristics. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions by management
in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period including
depreciation of property and equipment and amortization or impairment of
intangible assets. The Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis and relies on historical experience and various other factors
that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances to determine such
estimates. Because uncertainties with respect to estimates and assumptions are
inherent in the preparation of financial statements, actual results could
differ from these estimates. ReclassificationCertain reclassifications
of prior periods data have been made to conform to the current period
reporting. Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. 31 CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Revenue Recognition and Accounts ReceivableThe Company
recognizes revenue upon delivery of each job, except for bill and hold
transactions, in which case such revenue is recognized when all the service
delivery criteria are fully met as per Staff Accounting Bulletin 104 issued by
the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. Losses, if any, on jobs are
recognized at the earliest date such amount is determinable. The Company
derives the majority of its revenues from sales and services to a broad and
diverse group of customers with no individual customer accounting for more than
10% of the Companys revenues in any of the years ended March31, 2006,
2005 or 2004. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based
upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are reflected net of allowance for
doubtful accounts of $2,514 and $2,465 at March31, 2006 and 2005. InventoriesInventories are valued at
the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out method for raw
materials and the specific identification method for work in progress and
finished goods. The carrying values of inventories are set forth below

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
net Goodwill totaled $86,640 at March 31, 2006 and represents the excess
of the Companys purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of
acquired businesses, net of previously recorded amortization and impairment
expense. The net book value of other
intangible assets at March 31, 2006 was $13,395. Other intangible assets consist primarily of
the value assigned to such items as customer lists and tradenames in connection
with the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions under SFAS No. 142.
Other intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over
periods of up to ten years. Amortization
expense totaled $1,321 in 2006 and $155 in 2005. Other AssetsOther assets are
principally comprised of deferred tax assets and non-current cash invested in
restricted money-market funds. None of the individual items in other assets at
March31, 2006 and 2005 were individually greater than 5% of total assets
in those years. Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company
determines the realization of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and
its other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and
intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. Under SFAS No142, the Company determines
fair value using capitalization of earnings estimates and market valuation
multiples for each reporting unit. Under SFAS No144, the Company
compares the carrying value of long-lived assets to its projection of future
undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets, and evaluates other factors
such as business trends and general economic conditions. In the event that the
carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the Company records
an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value
over the assets fair value. Accrued LiabilitiesThe significant components

In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Other
accrued liabilities are principally comprised of customer advances and accrued
self-insurance claims for certain insurance programs. None of the individual
items in other accrued liabilities at March31, 2006 and 2005 were individually
greater than 5% of total current liabilities in those years. Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, in November2004 which amends Chapter
4 of the Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No. 43. SFASNo151 is
required to be applied to all inventory costs occurring in
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Companys April1, 2006 adoption of
SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. SFAS
No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, was issued in
December2004 and replaces SFAS No. 123, and supersedes the Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25.
SFAS No. 123R will require compensation costs related to share-based
payment transactions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost will be measured based
on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. In
addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period.
Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides
services in exchange for the award. SFAS
No. 123R allows companies to adopt its provisions using either of the
following transition alternatives i The modified prospective
method, which results in the recognition of compensation expense using
SFAS123R for all share-based awards granted or modified after the
effective date and the recognition of compensation expense using SFAS123
for all previously granted share-based awards that remain unvested at the
effective date;or ii The modified retrospective
method, which results in applying the modified prospective method and restating
prior periods by recognizing the financial statement impact of share-based
payments in a manner consistent with the pro forma disclosure requirements of
SFASNo123. The modified retrospective method may be applied to all
prior periods presented or previously reported interim periods of the year of adoption. The Company adopted SFAS
No. 123R on April 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact
of this adoption is expected to be materially consistent with the pro forma
expense discussed below under Stock-Based Compensation,
as adjusted for future vesting occurrences, grants, cancellations and exercises
of stock options. SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, was
issued in May 2005 and replaces APB
Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.
SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in
accounting principle in most instances and is required to be applied to all accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2005. The
Companys April1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Companys consolidated financial condition or results of
operations. Supplemental Cash Flow InformationThe
consolidated statements of cash flows provide information about the Companys
sources and uses of cash and exclude the effects of non-cash transactions. The
Company issued term notes payable totaling $16,508 and $13,252 see Note 5.
Long-Term Debt in the years ended March31, 2006 and 2005 to finance the
purchase of certain new equipment. In
addition, in the year ended March 31, 2005, the Company assumed a mortgage
obligation totaling $5,116 in connection with a prior year acquisition and also
assumed two industrial revenue bonds totaling $4,900 and other long-term debt

In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Other Information The
Company paid or received cash for interest and income taxes, net of refunds,
totaling $5,373 and $18,952 in 2006, $4,877 and $13,680in 2005, and
$7,227 and $2,460 in 2004. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect net income
divided by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive stock
options outstanding. Related Party TransactionsIn the normal course of
business, the Company leases certain real estate from individuals who formerly
owned an acquired printing business and are now employed by the Company. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Companys
financial instruments consist of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and
debt obligations. The Company does not currently hold or issue derivative
financial instruments. The Company believes that the fair value of its variable
rate debt obligations, which totaled $51,937 and $81,072 at March31, 2006
and 2005, respectively, approximated their recorded values. The Company
estimates that the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations totaling $49,562
at March31, 2006 was $41,280 and that the fair value of its fixed rate
debt obligations totaling $38,418 at March31, 2005 was $33,961. Estimates
of fair value are based on interest rates for the same or similar debt offered
to the Company having the same or similar maturities and collateral
requirements. Concentrations of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily
trade accounts receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
accounts receivable are limited because the Companys printing businesses
provide services to a large, diverse group of customers in various geographical
regions. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral for extensions of credit. The Companys
cash deposits are held in large, national financial institutions. Stock-Based CompensationPending the adoption of SFAS
No. 123R effective April 1, 2006 discussed above under Recent Accounting Pronouncements, the
Company accounts for its stock-based compensation programs using the intrinsic
value method of accounting established by APBOpinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations. Under APB Opinion No25, no compensation expense is
recognized when the exercise price of an employee stock option is equal to the
market price of common stock on the grant date and all other provisions of the
grant are fixed. The Companys only element of stock-based compensation is
derived pursuant to the Consolidated Graphics,Inc. Long-Term Incentive
Plan, as amended the Plan, which has been approved by the Companys
shareholders. Under the Plan, employees of the Company and members of the
Companys Board of Directors have been, or may be, granted options to purchase
shares of the Companys common stock at a price not less than the market price
of the stock at the date of grant. Pro forma information regarding net income and net income per share is
required by SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation for companies
accounting for stock-based compensation programs under APB Opinion No. 25.
The pro forma information has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its stock options under the fair value method set forth in SFAS No. 123.
The following is a summary of the Companys net income and net income per share
as reported and pro forma as if the fair value method of accounting had been
applied. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of
the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. The pro
forma effects of applying SFASNo123 may not be representative of
the effects on reported net income for future years since options vest over
several years and additional awards are made each year. 34 CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS,INC.

The Black-Scholes model used
by the Company to calculate the fair value of options granted, as well as other
currently accepted option valuation models, were developed to estimate the fair
value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting and/or
trading restrictions, which significantly differ from the provisions associated
with the Companys stock option awards. These models also require highly
subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected
time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. Accordingly,
management does not believe this model provides a reliable single measure of
the fair value of the Companys stock option awards. 3. ACQUISITIONS All
of the Companys acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method
of accounting. Revenues and expenses of the acquired businesses have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements beginning on
their respective dates of acquisition. The allocation of purchase price to the
acquired assets and liabilities is based on estimates of fair value and may be
prospectively revised if and when additional information the Company is
awaiting concerning certain asset and liability valuations is obtained,
provided that such information is received no later than one year after the
date of acquisition. Contingent transaction consideration pursuant to earnout
agreements is accrued as an additional cost of the transaction when payment
thereof is deemed to be probable by the Company. During
fiscal 2006, the Company assumed debt totaling $1,465 and paid cash totaling
$27,198 to acquire the operations and assets of four businesses, two of which
were immediately merged into other existing operations of the Company. The
preliminary allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired include
current assets of $7,283, property and equipment of $13,046, goodwill and intangible
assets of $13,275 and other assets of $55 less current liabilities of $4,996.
Additionally, the Company paid cash totaling $785 in connection with
finalization of certain working capital adjustments related to the Companys
fiscal 2005 acquisitions. Based on certain additional information received
regarding the 35 CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages fiscal
2005 acquisitions, $2,513 and $6,331 of purchase price previously attributed to
property and equipment and goodwill was allocated to intangible assets other
than goodwill during fiscal 2006. The
Company is awaiting additional information concerning certain asset and
liability valuations in order to finalize the allocation of purchase price for
certain of the Companys 2006 acquisitions, and expects to receive such
information no later than one year following the respective dates of the
acquisitions. During
fiscal 2005, the Company assumed debt totaling $8,251 and acquired for cash
totaling $45,524 the operations and assets of eight printing businesses. The
initial allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired include
current assets of $22,799, property and equipment of $33,116, goodwill and
intangibles of $11,521 and other assets of $2,678 less current liabilities of
$16,339. The initial purchase price allocation was adjusted in fiscal 2006 for
certain additional cash paid in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisitions
and certain other valuation adjustments, as described in the preceding
paragraphs. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of certain
printing businesses in prior periods, the Company paid cash totaling $3,299 and
assumed a related mortgage obligation totaling $5,116 to acquire certain real
property and paid cash of $138 to satisfy certain liabilities or pursuant to
earnout agreements. During
fiscal 2004, the Company acquired for cash totaling $10,042 the operations and
assets of six printing businesses, five of which were immediately merged into
other existing operations of the Company. The allocation of the purchase price
of the businesses acquired include current assets of $3,503, property and
equipment of $8,063, goodwill of $1,764 and other assets of $533, less current
liabilities of $3,821. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of
certain printing businesses in prior periods, the Company paid cash of $1,334
to satisfy certain liabilities or pursuant to earnout agreements. 4. PROPERTY

The
Companys primary bank credit facility as amended and restated, the Credit
Agreement is composed of a $150,000 revolving credit facility that will
mature in July2007. At March31, 2006, outstanding borrowings under
the Credit Agreement were $35,000 and accrued interest at a weighted average
rate of 665%. The
proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Agreement can be used to repay
certain indebtedness, finance certain acquisitions, provide for working capital
and general corporate purposes and, subject to certain restrictions, repurchase
the Companys common stock. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement
are secured by substantially all of the Companys assets other than real estate
and certain equipment subject to term equipment notes and other financings.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Companys option,
at either 1the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin of
125% to 200%, or 2an alternate base rate based upon the greater of
the agent banks prime lending rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus.50% plus a margin of up to 75%. The Company is also required to pay an
annual commitment fee ranging from 275% to 375% on available but unused
amounts under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate margin and the commitment
fee are based upon certain financial performance measures as set forth in the
Credit Agreement and are redetermined quarterly. At March31, 2006, the
applicable LIBOR interest rate margin was 125% and the applicable commitment
fee was 275%. The
Company is subject to certain covenants and restrictions and must meet certain
financial tests under the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with
such covenants, restrictions and financial tests at March31, 2006. In
addition to the Credit Agreement, the Company maintains two auxiliary revolving
credit facilities each an Auxiliary Bank Facility and collectively the Auxiliary
Bank Facilities with commercial banks. Each Auxiliary Bank Facility is
unsecured and has a maximum borrowing capacity of $5,000. One facility expires
in November2006 and the other facility expires in December 2006. At
March31, 2006, borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities
totaled $8,051 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 610%.
Because the Company currently has the ability to refinance borrowings
outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities expiring in Novemberand
December 2006, and currently plans to do so, such borrowings are classified as
long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at March31,
2006. The Auxiliary Bank Facilities
cross-default to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit
Agreement. The
Companys term equipment notes consist primarily of notes payable pursuant to
financing agreements between the Company and various lenders the Lender Notes
and between the Company and the finance affiliate of a printing equipment
manufacturer the Equipment Notes. At March31, 2006, outstanding
borrowings under the Lender Notes totaled $29,559 and accrued interest at a
weighted average rate of 556%. The Lender Notes provide for fixed monthly
principal payments plus interest at fixed rates for defined periods of up to
eight years from the date of issuance, and are secured by certain equipment of
the Company. At March31, 2006, outstanding borrowings under the Equipment
Notes totaled $11,756 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 593%.
The Equipment Notes provide for fixed payments of principal and interest at
fixed rates for defined periods of up to ten years from the date of issuance
and are secured by the equipment which was concurrently purchased from the
manufacturer. At March31, 2006, the remaining balance of term equipment
notes totaling $2,722 primarily consists of various secured debt obligations
assumed by the Company in connection with certain prior year acquisitions. The
Company is not subject to any significant financial covenants in connection
with any of the term equipment notes; however, the Credit Agreement places
certain limitations on the amount of additional term note obligations the
Company may incur in the future. 37 CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages The
Companys remaining debt obligations consist of a mortgage totaling $4,797, a
promissory note totaling $1,783, industrial revenue bonds totaling $6,995 and
various other debt totaling $836. The Company does not have any significant
financial covenants or restrictions associated with these other debt
obligations. The
principal payment requirements by fiscal year under the Companys debt
obligations referenced above are: 2007$10,821; 2008$53,501; 2009$9,740;
2010$11,384; 2011$6,924; and thereafter$9,129. As the Company has both the
ability and intent to refinance the $8,051 outstanding at March31, 2006
under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities due to expire in Novemberand December
2006, such borrowings are classified as long-term debt in our consolidated
balance sheet at March31, 2006, and also classified above as fiscal 2008
principal payment requirements in conjunction with the maturity of the Credit
Agreement. 6. INCOME TAXES The

income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts as
measured based on enacted tax laws and regulations. The Company records a
valuation allowance, when appropriate, to adjust deferred tax asset balances to
the amount the Company expects to realize. The Company considers the amount of
taxable income available in carryback years and future taxable income, among
other factors, in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance. The

Letters of CreditIn connection with the
assumption of obligations under outstanding industrial revenue bonds, which are
reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and
the Companys assumption of certain contingent liabilities related to certain
of its acquisitions, the Company had letters of credit outstanding as of
March31, 2006 totaling $8,982. In addition, the Company had one other
letter of credit totaling $100 outstanding as of March 31, 2006. All of these
letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of the Companys Credit
Agreement, which expires in July2007, and the Company will be required to
obtain replacement letters of credit at that time. Insurance ProgramsThe Company maintains
third-party insurance coverage in amounts and against risks it believes are
reasonable in its circumstances. The Company is self-insured for most workers
compensation claims and for a significant component of its group health
insurance programs. For these exposures, the Company accrues expected loss
amounts which are determined using a combination of its historical loss
experience and subjective assessment of its future loss exposure, together with
advice provided by administrators and consulting actuaries. The estimates of
expected loss amounts are subject to uncertainties arising from various
sources, including changes in claims reporting patterns, claims settlement
patterns, judicial decisions, legislation and economic conditions. Although the
Company believes that the accrued estimated loss amounts are reasonable under
the circumstances, significant differences related to the items noted above could
materially affect our risk exposure, insurance obligations and future expense. Legal MattersFrom time to time, the
Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary
course of its business. Currently, there are no legal proceedings or claims
pending against the Company that management believes will have a material
adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition or results
of operations. 39 CONSOLIDATED GRAPHICS,INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share and per share data and percentages Tax MattersThe Company is subject to
examination by tax authorities for varying periods in various taxing
jurisdictions. During the course of such
examinations disputes occur as to matters of fact and/or law. Also, in most taxing jurisdictions the
passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable
statutes of limitations thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting
an examination of the tax period for which such statute of limitation has
expired. The Company believes that it
has adequately provided for its tax liabilities. 8. STOCK OPTIONS Pursuant
to the Plan, employees of the Company and members of the Companys Board of
Directors have been, or may be, granted options to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock, restricted stock unit awards or other forms of
equity-based compensation. Options granted pursuant to the Plan may either be
incentive stock options within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or non-qualified stock options. Options
granted under the Plan are at a price not less than the market price of the
stock at the date of grant and periodically vest over a fixed period of up to
ten years. Unvested options generally are cancelled upon termination of
employment and vested options generally expire shortly after termination of
employment. Otherwise, options expire after final vesting at the end of a fixed
period generally not in excess of an additional five years. At March31,
2006, a total of 2,328,138 shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Plan, of which 403,679 shares of the Companys common stock were reserved for
options which had not been granted. The

Item 5. Controls and Procedures Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The
Companys management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive
Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as such term
is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Companys CEO and CFO
have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Companys disclosure
