REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors
Peerless Group, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peerless
Group, Inc. the Company, as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related
consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity
deficit for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Peerless
Group, Inc., at December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
Peerless Group, Inc., formerly known as TPG Holdings, Inc. the Company,
is a computer software company which develops and provides banking and credit
union software systems and services. The Company markets these systems along
with the computer equipment hardware to financial institutions primarily
located in the United States and Canada and provides conversion, support, and
maintenance and outsourcing services to customers using the systems. In
conjunction with the initial public offering of its common stock on October 3,
1996 the Offering, TPG Holdings, Inc. formed a new wholly-owned Delaware
subsidiary, Peerless Group, Inc., and TPG Holdings, Inc., was merged into this
new corporation. The financial statements included herein reflect the merger and
resulting change in capitalization as all share and per share amounts have been
retroactively restated to reflect the merger. In conjunction with this change in
capitalization, all treasury shares outstanding were cancelled.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
the Company and all its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
and balances are eliminated.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds, certificates of
deposit and Treasury Bills with original purchased maturities of three months or
less.
DEPRECIATION
Depreciation is provided on computer and other equipment using the
straight-line method over a five-to ten-year estimated useful life.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS
Computer software and maintenance contracts consist of fair values assigned
to acquired software and maintenance contracts. The amounts are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic benefit period of five
years. The amounts amortized and charged to cost of sales were approximately
$358,000, $403,000, and $308,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE
The Company expenses all software development costs as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established for the product, at which time
the costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to
customers.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company sources of revenue and the methods of revenue recognition are
as follows:
Software license and installation--Revenues from software contracts
involving installation are recognized when the installation is performed
according to contractual terms, which, in the case of long-term contracts,
involves the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.
Progress towards completion is measured based upon the percentage
relationship that costs incurred to date
24
PEERLESS GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
bear to total estimated costs to complete the installation. Revenues from
license fees not involving installation are recognized upon delivery of the
software to the customer when no significant vendor obligations remain.
Hardware and equipment--Commissions and revenues from hardware and equipment
sales are recognized upon shipment by the manufacturer.
Maintenance and services--Revenues from maintenance and service contracts
are recognized ratably over the periods of the respective contracts.
Revenues from data and check and statement imaging processing services are
recognized in the period in which the services are performed.
UNEARNED REVENUES
Deposits received and amounts billed for software licenses, installation and
hardware in advance of installation or delivery, and for annual software
maintenance prior to performance of related services, are reflected as unearned
until such amounts are recognized in accordance with the Company revenue
recognition policy.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK CONCENTRATION
Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities and unearned revenues are stated at expected settlement values which
approximate fair value.
Accounts receivable potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk as the Company markets its products and services primarily to
financial institutions throughout the United States and Canada. The Company
performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and
generally does not require collateral; however, deposits for future services or
products are frequently required.
STOCK OPTIONS
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES APB 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because, as
discussed in Note 9, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Statement 123, requires use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statement, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

PEERLESS GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EARNINGS PER SHARE
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE Statement 128.
Statement 128 replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per
share with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per
share, basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options,
warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar
to the previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per
share amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate,
restated to conform to the Statement 128 requirements.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN
ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION Statement 131, which is effective for years
beginning after December 15, 1997. Statement 131 establishes standards for the
way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments
in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises report
selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports. It
also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers. The Company will adopt the new
requirements retroactively in 1998. Management has not completed its review of
Statement 131, but does not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will
affect results of operations or financial position, but will affect the
disclosure of segment information.
In October 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Public Accountants issued Statement of Position SOP
97-2, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, which supersedes SOP 91-1. The Company will
be required to adopt SOP 97-2 for software transactions entered into beginning
January 1, 1998. SOP 97-2 generally requires revenue earned on software
arrangements involving multiple elements i.e., software products,
upgrades/enhancements, postcontract customer support, installation, training,
etc. to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the
elements. The fair value of an element must be based on evidence which is
specific to the vendor. The revenue allocated to software products including
specified upgrades/enhancements generally is recognized upon delivery of the
products. The revenue allocated to postcontract customer support generally is
recognized ratably over the term of the support and revenue allocated to service
elements such as training and installation generally is recognized as the
services are performed. If a vendor does not have evidence of the fair value for
all elements in a multiple-element arrangement, all revenue from the arrangement
is deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered. The
Company management anticipates that the adoption of SOP 97-2 will not have a
material impact on the Company results of
operations.
CHANGES IN PRESENTATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year
presentation.
3. INVESTMENT IN PREFERRED STOCK
In May 1997, the Company purchased 25,000 shares of the preferred stock of
Online Resources & Communications Corporation Online, a private electronic
financial services company, for $25 million.
26
PEERLESS GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
3. INVESTMENT IN PREFERRED STOCK CONTINUED
This preferred stock is convertible into approximately 833,000 shares of
Online common stock. The Company also received warrants to purchase
approximately 333,000 shares of Online common stock at $300 per share. The
Company understands that Online is seeking additional financing. If Online is
not able to obtain additional financing, the Company may be required to write
off some or all of this investment.
4. DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS
LINE OF CREDIT
In January 1997, the Company amended its line of credit agreement with a
bank that provides for borrowings up to $2,500,000, reduced by the value of
outstanding letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the Company.
Borrowings using this line of credit bear interest at the bank prime rate
850% at December 31, 1997 plus 1/2% and are collateralized by the assets of
the Company wholly owned subsidiaries. The facility will expire on February 1,
1999. No amounts were outstanding on the line of credit at December 31, 1997,
and a letter of credit in the amount of $600,000 was issued by the bank on
behalf of the Company at that date.
The line of credit agreement contains restrictive covenants, the most
significant of which relate to minimum defined annual net income, quarterly cash
flow and the restriction on the payment of cash dividends. At December 31, 1997,
the Company was in compliance with such covenants.
Under the terms of the line of credit agreement, the bank was issued a
warrant to purchase at any time on or before October 1, 2002, 115,680 shares of
the Company common stock at a purchase price of $542 per share. Included in
the warrant agreement was a provision allowing the bank to put the warrant back
to the Company at any time after October 1, 1999, at a price equal to the
then-current market price of the Company common stock. No value was assigned
to the warrant at the date of issuance and no accretion was recorded, as the
Company determined that there was no significant value separately assignable to
the warrant and put option. In June 1996, the line of credit agreement was
amended such that the provision allowing the bank to put the warrant back to the
Company was terminated.
LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO RELATED PARTIES
The Company repaid all of its debt upon completion of the Offering. In prior
years, the terms of certain Subordinated Debentures and Acquisition notes
included warrants to purchase up to 65% of the Company common stock by the
holders of the Subordinated Debentures the Holders. After giving effect to
several transactions, including the repurchase of warrants for $3,776,000 in
cash and notes, which were recorded as reductions to additional paid-in-capital,
the Holders had warrants to purchase 375% of the outstanding common stock of
the Company at December 31, 1995. In June 1996, the Holders exercised warrants
to purchase 505,710 shares of the Company common stock, and in October 1996,
in conjunction with the Offering, they sold warrants to the underwriters to
purchase 597,360 shares of the Company common stock. In December 1997, the
Holders exercised warrants to purchase an additional 181,654 shares of the
Company common stock. Therefore, at December 31, 1997, the Holders own
warrants to purchase 181,654 shares of the Company common stock. The warrants
are exercisable at a price of $0025 per share and expire in October, 2000.

5. INCOME TAXES
The Company uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ACCOUNTING FOR
INCOME TAXES. The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows
in thousands:
DECEMBER 31,
1997    1996    1995
Current:
$   312 $   51 $   38

The effective income tax rate on income before income taxes differed from
the Federal income tax statutory rate for the following reasons in thousands:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

73     81                                                                                          $   534 $   155 $   64
Given the historical trends in generating taxable income and the expected
future earnings, in the fourth quarter of 1996 the Company determined that it
was more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would be realized. As
a result of the Company judgement, the valuation allowance was eliminated and
a deferred tax benefit of approximately $250,000 was recorded.
During the three months ended September 30, 1997, the Company identified
research and development tax credits totaling $459,000. As a result, the
estimated effective tax rate for the fiscal year was lowered to 219%. As of

7. EMPLOYEE 401k PLAN
The Company has a plan which provides retirement benefits under the
provisions of Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code the Plan for
substantially all employees who have completed a specified term of service. The
Company contributions equal 50% of employee contributions, up to a maximum of
6% of eligible employee compensation, as defined. Benefits under the Plan are

expense during the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, were
approximately $128,000, $122,000, and $90,000, respectively.
8. COMMON STOCK
In July 1996, the Company adopted an employee stock purchase plan under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the employee
stock purchase plan, employees may make annual purchases of the Company common
stock at a price equal to 85% of the market value of the common stock on certain
specified dates. The Company has reserved 250,000 shares of its common stock for
issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.
During 1997 and 1996, the Company issued 1,675 and 19,620 shares,
respectively, of restricted stock to employees at weighted-average fair values
of $638 and $538 per share, respectively. The Company recorded approximately
$10,000 and $102,000, respectively, of unearned compensation for the excess of
the deemed value for accounting purposes of the common stock issued over the
proceeds received upon issuance. The unearned compensation is charged to expense
ratably over the vesting period of the common stock. During 1997 and 1996,
approximately $83,000 and $98,000 was charged to operations.
9. STOCK OPTIONS
The Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the
Peerless Group, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan the Plan effective as of April
22, 1997. The Plan reserves 450,000 shares of the Company common stock for
future issuance. Each option to be granted under the Plan will be exercisable as
provided by the terms of each option, but in no case longer than ten years from
the date of the option grant. Historically, the Company options have
generally vested 20% on the date of grant and 20% each year for the following
four years, with an exercise period of five years from the date of grant.

The total options outstanding at December 31, 1997, included 96,000 options
with exercise prices ranging from $260 to $287 and a weighted-average
remaining contractual life of 20 years; and 310,000 options with exercise
prices ranging from $450 to $880 and a weighted-average remaining contractual
life of 42 years. Exercisable options at December 31, 1997, included 58,800
options with exercise prices ranging from $260 to $287 and a weighted-average
exercise price of $267; and 89,540 options with exercise prices ranging from
$450 to $880 and a weighted-average exercise price of $764. Under APB 25,
because the exercise price of the Company employee stock options equals or
exceeds the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by Statement 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995 respectively: risk-free interest rates of
582%, 579% and 737%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the
Company common stock of 502, 347 and 447; and no dividend yields. In
addition, the fair value of these options was estimated based on an expected
life of one year from the vesting date using the multiple option method.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the

Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period. The Company
pro forma information follows in thousands, except for earnings per share
information:
1997    1996    1995
Pro forma net  $  1,698 $  2,170 $  1,789
Pro forma basic earnings per  $  036 $  077 $  088
Pro forma diluted earnings per  $  034 $  053 $  048
The pro forma disclosures only include the effect of options granted
subsequent to December 31, 1994. Accordingly, the pro forma information does not
reflect the pro forma effect of all previous stock option grants of the Company,
and thus is not indicative of future amounts until Statement No. 123 is applied
to all outstanding stock options.
10. OPERATIONS
The Company is dependent upon International Business Machines Corporation
IBM as its principal computer hardware vendor for its financial institution
applications systems. Additionally, operating systems on which the Company
products function have been developed by IBM. Since its inception in 1989, the
Company has been a value-added remarketer of IBM products pursuant to standard
IBM Remarketer Agreements. The Company current remarketing agreement with IBM
expires on February 28, 1999. Both IBM and the Company may, with or without
cause, upon three months written notice, terminate the agreement. The Company
has no indication that IBM will discontinue the remarketing agreement. The
Company believes that its relationships with IBM are good.
11. SEVERANCE CHARGE
During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company incurred a severance
charge of $341,000 related to the resignation of a former officer $289,000 of
which were non-cash compensation charges related to the extension of the
exercise period of certain stock options and the acceleration of vesting of
restricted stock awards.

20,000 shares of common stock at $880 per share were outstanding during 1997
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because
the options' exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.
