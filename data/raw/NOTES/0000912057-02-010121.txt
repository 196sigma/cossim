In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income and cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Imation Corp. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. S/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
NOTE 1BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
BACKGROUND Imation
Corp. Imation or the Company, a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1996 as a result of the spin-off of substantially all of the businesses which comprised the data
storage and imaging systems groups of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company 3M. The Company develops, manufactures, and markets magnetic and optical removable data storage products and provides
data storage services to information technology systems users. Additionally, until the sale of the color proofing and color software business effective December 31, 2001 see Note 3, the Company was
an active participant in the graphic arts industry as a manufacturer and marketer of products and services for the capture, enhancement, management, and transmission of color images. The Company also
maintains a business that provides call center, help desk support, spare parts logistics, and field service to end-user customers through the Company relationships with Original
Equipment Manufacturers OEMs of wide format color and imaging equipment; provides repair service to large OEMs of wide-format color and imaging equipment; and is a systems integrator for
customers with wide-format engineering document imaging systems migrating from analog to digital. 
BASIS
OF PRESENTATION 
On
December 31, 2001, the Company closed on the sale of its worldwide color proofing and color software business. The results of operations for this business are included in continuing
operations within the Color Technologies business segment for all periods presented. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2001 excludes all assets and liabilities which were included in the sale. On
August 2, 1999, the Company closed on the sale of its worldwide Photo Color Systems business and its manufacturing facility in Ferrania, Italy. This sale completed the disposition of the Company
Medical Imaging and Photo Color Systems segment and, therefore, these operations are presented in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations for 1999. Unless
otherwise noted,
disclosures of revenues and expenses in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refer to continuing operations only. 
NOTE 2SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CONSOLIDATION.The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated. 
USE
OF ESTIMATES.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. FOREIGN
CURRENCY.Local currencies are considered the functional currencies outside the U.S., except for Imation Europe B.V., the Company European holding company, and
subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, where the U.S. dollar is considered the functional currency. Effective January 1, 2001, Imation Europe B.V. changed its functional currency to
the Euro. The impact of this change on the consolidated financial statements was not material. Generally, income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
year. For operations in local currency environments, assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates with cumulative translation adjustments included as a component of
shareholders' equity. For operations in which the U.S. dollar is considered the functional currency, certain financial statement amounts are translated at historical exchange rates, with all other
assets and liabilities translated at year-end exchange rates. These translation 
31  adjustments are reflected in the results of operations. Net foreign currency exchange impacts included in results of operations were not material in all periods presented. 
CONCENTRATIONS
OF CREDIT RISK.The Company sells a wide range of products and services to a diversified base of customers around the world and performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition, and therefore believes there is no material concentration of credit risk. 
CASH
EQUIVALENTS.Cash equivalents consist of temporary investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less. 
INVENTORIES.Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis. DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective January 1, 2000. The Company also adopted SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and
Certain Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, effective July 1, 2000. SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that all derivatives, including
foreign currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be recorded at fair value through operations. If a derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the underlying assets or liabilities through operations or
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders' equity until the underlying hedged item is recognized in operations. The ineffective portion of a derivative change in
fair value is to be immediately recognized in operations. These gains and losses generally are recognized as an adjustment to cost of goods sold for inventory-related hedge transactions, or as
adjustments to foreign currency transaction gains/losses included in non-operating expenses for foreign denominated payables- and receivables-related hedge transactions. Cash flows attributable to
these financial instruments are included with cash flows of the associated hedged items. OTHER
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.The Company other financial instruments consist principally of cash and equivalents, and short-term receivables and payables, for
which their current carrying amounts approximate fair market value. Investments primarily include venture capital investments accounted for on a cost basis. 
PROPERTY,
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Periodic reviews for impairment of the
carrying value of property, plant and equipment are made based on undiscounted expected future cash flows. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of are
removed from the related accounts and resulting gains or losses are reflected in the results of operations. 
Plant
and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated depreciable lives range from 15 to 40 years for
buildings and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. 
INTANGIBLE
ASSETS.Intangible assets consist primarily of capitalized software. The Company capitalizes certain external and internal costs related to the design and
implementation of internally developed software, along with related interest. Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from three to eight years. The
carrying amount of intangible assets is 
32  periodically reviewed to assess the remaining useful lives and the recoverability based on undiscounted expected future cash flows. In 2000, the Company shortened the useful life of the majority of
its capitalized software see Note 15. 
RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.In 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, which addresses accounting and financial reporting for business combinations. This statement is effective in its entirety for the Company on January 1, 2002. Also
in 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which addresses accounting and financial reporting for intangible assets
acquired individually or with a group of other assets, except for those acquired in a business combination. This statement is effective in its entirety for the Company on January 1, 2002. The Company
does not believe that adoption of these statements will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 
Also
in 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses
issues relating to the implementation of FASB Statement No. 121 FAS121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of, and develops a single accounting model, based on the framework established in FAS121, for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and
used or newly acquired. The Company will adopt this statement in 2002 and is in the process of determining the extent to which this statement will impact its results of operations or financial
position. 
REVENUE
RECOGNITION.In 2000, the Company changed its revenue recognition policy for product revenues, such that revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of
ownership pass, which is primarily upon delivery of goods to customers see Note 16. Revenue from services is recognized upon performance. Revenue from service contracts is deferred and recognized
over the life of the contracts as service is performed. 
RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS.Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. ADVERTISING
COSTS.Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred and totaled approximately $28 million, $28 million, and $35 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. 
INCOME
TAXES.The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under
the asset and liability method prescribed in SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. TREASURY
STOCK.The Company repurchases of shares of common stock are recorded as treasury stock and are presented as a reduction of shareholders' equity. When treasury
shares are reissued, the Company uses a last-in, first-out method and the excess of repurchase cost over reissuance price is treated as an adjustment to retained earnings
accumulated deficit. 
STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION.The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value approach under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Accordingly, compensation cost for employee stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of the Company common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. 
33  COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME.Comprehensive income loss for the Company includes net income loss, the effects of currency translation, unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges, and minimum pension liability adjustments. Comprehensive income loss for all periods presented
is included in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity. EARNINGS
PER SHARE.Basic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period adjusted for Employee Stock Ownership
Plan ESOP shares not allocated to employee accounts. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average basic shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding
stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of the weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for: Years Ended December 31,

2001 and 2000, options to purchase 46 million and 54 million shares, respectively, of the Company common stock were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
because the Company had net losses and to do so would have been antidilutive. As of December 31, 1999, the number of such antidilutive options excluded from the computation was immaterial. 
NOTE 3DIVESTITURES 
On December 31, 2001, the Company consummated the sale of its worldwide color proofing and color software business to Kodak Polychrome Graphics LLC and Kodak
Polychrome Graphics CompanyLTD collectively referred to as KPG. KPG acquired substantially all the assets and assumed substantially all the liabilities associated with this business. Under
the terms of the agreement, KPG paid the Company $50 million in cash on December 31, 2001. This amount is shown as proceeds from sale of businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the
year ended December 31, 2001. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $19 million $13 million after taxes net of related costs in restructuring and other in the Consolidated Statement
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. 
On
November 30, 1998, the Company sold its worldwide Medical Imaging Systems business the Medical Imaging Sale to Eastman Kodak Company Kodak. Excluded from the Medical Imaging Sale
was the Company medical imaging/photo color manufacturing facility in Ferrania, Italy the Ferrania Facility, at which the Company agreed to manufacture wet laser and x-ray film and
hardware pursuant to an exclusive supply agreement the Ferrania Supply Agreement with Kodak. In exchange for retaining the 
34  Ferrania Facility and pursuant to certain conditions, Kodak agreed to pay the Company up to $250 million at such time as it was sold. 
Under
the terms of the asset purchase agreement dated as of July 31, 1998 and amended and restated as of November 30, 1998 between the Company and Kodak, Kodak paid the Company $5322
million in cash prior to December 31, 1998. Of the $5322 million cash proceeds, the Company was restricted from using $1430 million until the first quarter of 1999; this amount is shown as a
component of
proceeds from sale of businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 1999. 
On
August 2, 1999, the Company closed on the sale of its worldwide Photo Color Systems business, together with the Ferrania Facility, the Ferrania Supply Agreement, and certain other
associated businesses, to Schroder Ventures, through Schroder Ventures' wholly owned affiliate, Ferrania Lux, S.A.R.L. The $589 million of proceeds from this sale are shown as a component of proceeds
from sale of businesses in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 1999. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a loss of $30 million, net of income
tax benefits of $71 million, in 1999. 
Kodak
has challenged the Company claim for the full $250 million as well as claims for other amounts which the Company believes are due from Kodak in connection with the Medical
Imaging Sale. The Company has retained cash, as reflected in its financial statements, which it collected on behalf of Kodak in an amount approximately equal to the disputed items. While the Company
cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these disputes, it believes its positions are supported by the applicable contractual terms. In
connection with the sale of the Medical Imaging and Photo Color Systems businesses, the Company received reimbursement for certain transition services and distribution agreements that
the Company had agreed to provide Kodak and Schroder Ventures. Reimbursements for these transition services are presented as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations. These transition services substantially ended as of December 31, 2000. 
As
a result of the sale of the Photo Color Systems business and the Ferrania Facility, the Company completed the disposition of its Medical Imaging and Photo Color Systems segment. As
such, the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations present the Photo Color Systems business as discontinued operations for 1999. Income from operations of the discontinued business includes
interest expense allocations based on the ratio of net assets of discontinued operations to consolidated net assets plus debt. 
The
results of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 were as follows:  In millions Net revenues 1247 Income before income taxes 93 Income tax provision 47 Income from operations of discontinued business, net of income taxes 46 Loss on disposal of discontinued business, net of income taxes 30 Total discontinued operations 16 35

NOTE 5RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES 
In 2001, the Company recorded $545 million of restructuring and other charges to reduce its administrative structure, improve the profitability of the remaining,
non-data storage businesses, and rationalize its data storage manufacturing. The charges include $290 million for employee separation programs related to a headcount reduction of
approximately 500 employees, of which approximately 40percent relate to administrative structure and 55 percent relate to the non-data storage businesses. The Company also recorded
a $20 million special charge reflecting inventory write-downs in cost of goods sold. During 2001, the Company made cash payments of $24 million related to the reduction of approximately 100
employees. The majority of the severance and other payments associated with this restructuring are expected to be completed in 2002.

2000, the Company recorded a $246 million restructuring charge to rationalize its manufacturing operations, streamline its organizational structure, and write-down
impaired assets. The charges include $159 million for employee separation programs related to a headcount reduction of approximately 430 employees. The reduction in employee positions affected all
business units and corporate staff, with approximately 60 percent of the headcount reductions due to rationalization of manufacturing within the Data Storage and Information management DSIM
business. The Company also recorded $102 million in special charges comprised of $79 million of inventory write-downs in cost of goods sold and $23 million of charges in selling, general and
administrative expense. In 2000, the Company also reversed $26 million of restructuring charges related to the 1997 and 1998 programs described below. This amount is reflected in the net
restructuring charges of $220 million in 2000. 
In
1997 and 1998, the Company recorded charges to restructure its worldwide operations in order to improve the Company competitive position, to focus resources on areas of strength and
on growth opportunities, to reduce costs and eliminate unnecessary structure, and to write down assets. The activities related to these programs were substantially completed as of December 31, 2001. 
During
2001, 2000, and 1999, the Company made cash payments of $130 million, $209 million, and $200 million, respectively, related to the 2000, 1998, and 1997 restructuring programs.
The remaining restructuring balances related to these programs consist of $07 million for severance and $26 million for other payments. The remaining activities associated with these programs are
expected to be completed in 2002. Since the inception of these restructuring programs through December 31, 2001, the Company has reduced
its headcount related to continuing operations by approximately 2,500, which includes both voluntary and involuntary employee reductions.

Of the aggregate net operating loss carryforwards, $242 million expire at various times between 2004 and 2020, and $308 million may be carried forward indefinitely. Certain foreign net operating
loss carryforwards are subject to adjustment by foreign tax authorities. The foreign tax credit carryforwards expire by 2006. 
The
future recoverability of the Company net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income, primarily in the U.S. The Company believes that it will
generate sufficient future taxable income to recover the Company recorded net deferred tax assets.

The
benefit provision for income taxes from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. income
tax rate 35percent because of the following items: In millions

of December 31, 2001, approximately $2194 million of earnings attributable to international subsidiaries were considered to be permanently invested. No provision has been made for
taxes that might be payable if these earnings were remitted to the U.S. It is not practical to determine the amount of incremental tax that might arise if these earnings were to be remitted. 
As
a result of income tax refunds, net cash received for income taxes was $122 million in 2001. Cash paid for income taxes, relating to both continuing and discontinued operations, was
$134 million and $200 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively. 
NOTE 7DEBT 
The Company had no outstanding long-term debt as of December 31, 2001 or 2000. 
The
Company has a Loan and Security Agreement the Loan Agreement with a group of banks. This Loan Agreement was set to expire on December 31, 2001; however, the agreement was amended
to extend the Loan Agreement by two years with essentially the same terms, and to reduce the size to $1000 million. The amended Loan Agreement expires December 31, 2003. The Loan Agreement provides
for revolving credit, including letters of credit, with borrowing availability based on eligible accounts receivable, inventory and manufacturing machinery and equipment not to exceed $1750 million.
The Loan Agreement provides for, at the option of the Company, borrowings at either a floating interest rate based on a defined prime rate or a fixed rate related to the London Interbank Offering Rate
LIBOR, plus a margin based on the Company interest expense coverage. The margins over a defined prime rate and LIBOR range from zero to 075 percent and 125 to 225 percent, respectively. Letter
of credit fees are equal to the LIBOR margins and a commitment fee of 0375 percent per annum is payable on the unused line. The Loan Agreement is collateralized by substantially all the domestic
assets of the Company, excluding the corporate campus land and buildings, and a pledge of 65 percent of the stock of certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries. Covenants include maintenance of a
minimum tangible net worth and borrowing base availability, with certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, sale of assets, mergers and consolidation, transactions with
affiliates, creation of liens, and certain other matters. Borrowing availability as of December 31, 2001 was $814 million. No borrowings were outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of December 31,
2001. 
No
borrowings were outstanding under the Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $188 million
and $40 million, respectively, in the U.S. 
39  Short-term
debt as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $128 million and $237 million, respectively, which consisted primarily of local borrowings by international
subsidiaries. These borrowings have original maturities of one year or less and have a weighted average interest rate of 22 percent and 47 percent as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As
of December 31, 2001, the Company had an additional $335 million available under credit facilities held by various subsidiaries outside the U.S. 
The
Company estimates that the fair value of its short-term debt approximates the carrying amount as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. The
Company interest expense for 2001, 2000, and 1999 was $14 million, $22 million, and $21 million, respectively. Cash paid for interest in these periods, relating to both
continuing and discontinued operations, was $17 million, $21 million, and $28 million, respectively. 
NOTE 8DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
The Company maintains a foreign currency exposure management policy that allows for the use of derivative instruments, principally foreign currency forward and
option contracts, to manage risks associated with exchange rate volatility. These contracts are entered into to fix the U.S. dollar amount of the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions.
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge items. This process
includes linking all derivatives to booked or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used
in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be
highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, with gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income loss recognized in current period
operations. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives. The
Company enters into foreign currency forward-exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure of its firm commitments to purchase and sell goods that qualify as fair-value
hedges. These forward-exchange contracts mature in twelve months or less. 
Beginning
January 1, 2001, substantially all of the Company intercompany sales to Europe are denominated in Euros. The Company purchased options as hedges of a portion of the
anticipated 2002 and 2001 sales that qualify as cash-flow hedges. These option contracts range in duration from one to twelve months. Hedge costs of $25 million were reclassified into
operations for the year ended December 31, 2001. Amounts reclassified into operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 were not significant. Upon
adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect-type loss adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to recognize the fair value of
foreign currency contracts designated as cash-flow hedging instruments. The adjustment did not have a significant impact on the Company financial position or results of operations at
adoption. The amount of accumulated net deferred gains on foreign currency cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income loss in shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2001 was $13
million, pre-tax, all of which is expected to reverse in 2002. 
As
of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the fair value of the Company foreign currency forward and option contracts outstanding was $35 million and $10 million, respectively. The estimated
fair market values were determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. 
40  The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counter-parties in foreign currency forward and option contracts, but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of
these counter-parties. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial
institutions as counter-parties. 
NOTE 9LEASES 
Rent expense under operating leases, which primarily relate to equipment and office space, amounted to $141 million, $139 million, and $121 million in 2001,
2000, and 1999, respectively. The following table sets forth the minimum rental payments under operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2001: In millions

The Company maintains a shareholder rights plan Rights Plan under which the Company has issued one preferred share purchase right Right for each common share
of the Company. If they become exercisable, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $125,
subject to adjustment. The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group Acquiring Person acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the Company outstanding common stock, except
that the Rights Plan excludes acquisitions by any Acquiring Person who becomes the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding as a result of a reduction in
the number of shares of common stock outstanding due to the repurchase of common stock by the Company unless and until such person, after becoming aware of such, acquires beneficial ownership of any
additional shares of common stock. The Rights expire on July 1, 2006 and may be redeemed earlier by the Board of Directors for $001 per Right. 
During
the first quarter of 1997, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 6 million shares of the Company common stock. During the first and second quarters
of 1997, approximately 25 million shares were repurchased. On January 26, 1999, the Company announced an incremental increase of 65 million shares to the remaining open share repurchase
authorization, to bring the total to 10 million shares. A minimal number of shares was repurchased during 2001. During 2000 and 1999, the Company repurchased approximately 24 million and 44 million
shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2001, the Company held 76 million shares of treasury stock acquired at an average price of $2246 per share.

44  NOTE 13EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS 
The Company sponsors a 401k retirement savings plan under which eligible U.S. employees may choose to save up to 15 percent of eligible compensation on a
pre-tax basis, subject to certain IRS limitations. The Company matches employee contributions 100 percent on the first three percent of eligible compensation and 25 percent on the next
three percent of eligible compensation. The Company also sponsors a variable compensation program, in which the Company may, at its option, contribute up to three percent of eligible employee
compensation to employees' 401k retirement accounts, depending upon Company performance. The
Company established an ESOP during 1996 as a cost-effective way of funding the employee retirement savings benefits noted above. The ESOP borrowed $500 million from the Company in
1996 and used the proceeds to purchase approximately 22 million shares of the Company common stock, with the ESOP shares pledged as collateral for the debt. The Company makes monthly contributions
to the ESOP to cover the debt service plus an additional amount so that the total contribution releases shares to satisfy the Company matching requirements. As the debt is repaid, shares are
released from collateral, and these shares are allocated to employee accounts as they are earned. The shares not yet allocated to employee accounts are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares allocated to employee accounts, and all such shares are considered outstanding for
the computation of earnings per share. 
The
ESOP shares as of December 31, 2001 and 2000 are as follows: 2001
2000 Released and allocated shares 1,886,599 1,630,759 Unallocated shares 289,288 545,128 Total original ESOP shares 2,175,887 2,175,887 Fair value of unallocated shares as of December31 6,242,835 8,449,000 Total
expense related to the ESOP was $57 million, $79 million, and $61million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. 
NOTE 14EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS 
The Company currently has stock options outstanding under the Imation 1996 Employee Stock Incentive Program the Employee Plan, the Imation 1996 Directors Stock
Compensation Program the Directors Plan, and the Imation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. The

years and generally become exercisable from one to five years after grant date. As a result of the approval and adoption of the Incentive Plan, no further shares are available for grant under the
Employee Plan. 
45  The Directors Plan was also approved and adopted by 3M, as the sole shareholder of the Company, and became effective on July 1, 1996. The total number of shares of common stock that may
be issued or awarded under the Directors Plan may not exceed 800,000. The outstanding options are non-qualified options with a term of ten years and generally become exercisable one year after grant
date. Grant prices are generally equal to the fair market value of the Company common stock at the date of grant. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, there were 349,917 shares and 394,071 shares
available for grant under the Directors Plan, respectively. 
The
Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by Imation shareholders on May 16, 2000, and became effective immediately. The total number of shares of common stock that may be issued or
awarded under the Incentive Plan may not exceed 4 million. All shares under the plan that are canceled or terminated will be available again for issuance pursuant to awards under the Incentive Plan.

Company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized for the stock option plans. If the fair value of options granted had been recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting periods in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123, pro forma pre-tax losses would 
46  have been $90 million higher $55million after taxes or $016 per basic and diluted share for 2001 and $103million higher $63million after taxes or $018 per basic and
diluted share for 2000, and pro forma pre-tax income would have been $58 million lower $36million after taxes or $010 per basic and diluted share for1999. 
The
weighted average fair values at date of grant for options granted by the Company, all of which had exercise prices equal to the market price on the grant date, were $918, $1380,
and $816 in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

During the last half of 2000, the Company abandoned certain components of its current computer software system at various dates through the end of first quarter
2001. Accordingly, the Company shortened the estimated useful life of the majority of its capitalized software such that this portion was fully amortized by the end of first quarter 2001. The Company
recorded $608 million in pre-tax charges in 2000, and an additional $57 million in pre-tax charges in the first quarter 2001 related to the amortization of this software
being abandoned. These were all non-cash charges. 
NOTE 16CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE 
During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company changed its revenue recognition policy with regard to product sales. The Company previous policy stated that
revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers. Essentially, the new policy recognizes that the risks and rewards of ownership in many transactions do not substantively transfer to
customers until the product has been delivered, regardless of whether or not legal title has transferred. These new policies are consistent with the guidance contained in Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which became effective in the fourth quarter of 2000. The
effect of this change in revenue recognition policy, as of January 1, 2000, has been reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of 2000. Previously reported 2000
quarters have been restated to reflect the change. This change did not have a significant effect on 2000 results. 
Unaudited
pro forma results assuming retroactive application of the change in accounting principle for 1999 net income and earnings per share are substantially the same as reported. NOTE 17COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The Company is the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of its business. All such matters are subject to many
uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. Consequently, as of December 31, 2001, the Company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or
financial impact that may be incurred by the Company with 
47  respect to these matters. While these matters, certain of which are described below, could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods, it is management opinion that after
final disposition, any monetary liability to the Company beyond that provided in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2001 would not be material to the Company financial position. 
On
May 10, 1999, Jazz Photo Corp. Jazz Photo served the Company and its affiliate, Imation S.p.A., with a civil complaint filed in New Jersey Superior Court. The complaint charges
breach of contract, breach of warranty, fraud, and racketeering activity in connection with the Company sale of allegedly defective film to Jazz Photo by its Photo Color Systems business which was
sold in 1999 see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the complaint, Jazz Photo seeks unspecified compensatory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, and equitable relief. The
Company disputes any liability to Jazz Photo and is vigorously defending the action. Over the course of 2001, discovery continued and the parties continued to litigate the scope of document production
and discovery that will be required in the action. 
On
October 1, 2001, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, charging Quantum Corporation with violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman
Antitrust Act, including price fixing and conspiracy to monopolize the production and sale of data storage tape compatible with Quantum digital linear tape DLT tape drives. The Company has amended
the complaint to include Hitachi Maxell,Ltd. as an additional defendant and to add Quantum attempt to monopolize the production and sale of data storage tape compatible with Quantum
S-DLT tape drives. The lawsuit specifically charges that Quantum has fixed prices on DLT-compatible tape, invited Imation to join an illegal tape cartel, inappropriately extended patents
on licensed DLT tape drives to tape media as a way to enforce its monopoly hold on the tape market, and misrepresented DLT-compatible tape as an open standard with competitive pricing. The complaint
seeks an injunction barring Quantum from further violations of antitrust law in this market and recovery of damages of at least $150 million. 
On
October 3, 2001, Quantum Corporation filed a lawsuit in the Superior State Court in California in Santa Clara County seeking to prohibit Imation from selling its digital linear tape
for use on Quantum DLT tape drives. The lawsuit accuses Imation of misappropriation of trade secrets, deceptive and misleading advertising, and unfair business practices. The Company disputes any
liability to Quantum and is vigorously defending the action. Quantum also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Imation from selling Black Watch Digital Linear Tape IV
cartridges. The court issued a preliminary injunction that allowed the Company to sell its Black Watch Digital Linear Tape IV cartridges but required that the Company pay Quantum a 30 percent royalty
on those revenues as set forth in the license agreement between the parties during the interim until the claims are resolved. The Company has filed an appeal of this decision disputing the
imposition of the royalty payment.
