NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1.
Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Principles
of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Intevac, Inc. and its subsidiaries Intevac or the Company
after elimination of inter-company balances and transactions.   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.   Cash,
Cash Equivalents and Investments   Intevac considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.
Available-for-sale
securities, consisting solely of Auction Rate Securities
ARS, are carried at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses recorded within other comprehensive income
loss as a separate component of stockholders equity.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be
other than temporary, if any, on
available-for-sale
securities are included in earnings.
Held-to-maturity
securities are carried at amortized cost. The cost of investment
securities sold is determined by the specific identification
method.   Fair
Value Measurement Definition and
Hierarchy   Intevac reports certain financial assets and liabilities at fair
value. Intevac measures fair value in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification ASC
820-10,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which
defines fair value as the price that would be received from
selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date.   Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of
the following three categories   Level1 Valuations based on quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   Level2 Valuations based on other than
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   Level3 Valuations based on inputs that
are generally unobservable and typically reflect
managements estimates of assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.   As of December31, 2009, financial assets measured
utilizing: 1Level1 inputs included money market
funds in the amount of $93million and U.S.Treasury
Bills in the amount of $60million which were valued based
on quoted market prices in active markets for identical
securities, and 2Level3 inputs in the amount of
$662million included long-term investments in ARS
consisting of securities collateralized by student loans which
were valued using a third-party valuation firm and management
applying internal analysis to the valuation see Note8.
At December31, 2009, Intevac did not have any financial
assets measured utilizing Level2 inputs. Also at
December31, 2009, Intevac did not have any liabilities
that were required to be measured at fair value.   Trade
Receivables and Doubtful Accounts   Intevac evaluates the collectibility of trade receivables on an
ongoing basis and provides reserves against potential losses
when appropriate. Management analyzes historical bad debts,
customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, changes in
customer payment tendencies and current economic trends when
evaluating the   
43 Table of Contents   adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Customer
accounts are written off against the allowance when the amount
is deemed uncollectible.   Included in trade receivables are unbilled receivables related
to government contracts of $21million and
$13million at December31, 2009 and
December31, 2008, respectively which includes $371,000 and
$329,000 of fee retention, respectively.   Inventories   Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined on an average cost basis.   Property,
Plant and Equipment   Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: computers and
software, 3years; machinery and equipment, 5years;
furniture, 7years; vehicles, 4years; and leasehold
improvements, remaining lease term.   Goodwill
and Purchased Intangible Assets   Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment
annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For goodwill,
Intevac performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step,
Intevac compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its
carrying value. Intevacs reporting units are consistent
with the reportable segments identified in Note14, based
on the manner in which Intevac operates its business and the
nature of those operations. Depending on the facts and
circumstances Intevac determines the fair value of each of its
reporting units based upon the most appropriate valuation
technique using the income approach, the market approach or a
combination thereof. The income and market approaches were
selected as management believes these approaches generally
provide the most reliable indications of fair value when the
value of the operations is more dependent on the ability to
generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the
production process. Under the income approach Intevac calculates
the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value
of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach
Intevac estimates the fair value based on market multiples of
revenue or earnings for comparable companies. Each valuation
technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered
when applying those techniques. The income approach closely
correlates to managements expectations of future results
but requires significant assumptions which can be highly
sensitive. The market approach is relatively straightforward to
measure, but it may be difficult to find directly comparable
companies in the marketplace. If the fair value of the reporting
unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to
that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is
performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to
the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit,
then Intevac would perform the second step of the impairment
test in order to determine the implied fair value of the
reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a
reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value,
Intevac would record an impairment loss equal to the difference.
Intevac conducted these impairment tests in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2009 and the results of these tests indicated that
Intevacs goodwill and purchased intangible asset with an
indefinite useful live were not impaired.   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Intevac recorded an
impairment charge of $105million for goodwill and
purchased technology intangible assets due to a decline in
market value of Intevacs common stock and lower revenue
expectations in light of current operating performance and
future operating expectations.   Intevacs methodology for allocating the purchase price
relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through
established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the
acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities
assumed. Intevac assigns assets acquired including goodwill
and liabilities assumed to a reporting unit as of the date of
acquisition. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are
tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual
tests in certain circumstances, and written down when impaired.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, based upon an interim
impairment analysis Intevac wrote off all $97million of
goodwill in its Equipment segment.   
44 Table of Contents   Purchased intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized
over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be
indefinite. Purchased intangible assets are carried at cost,
less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally one
to thirteen years using the straight line method.   Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to
be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of
recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment
loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible
assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the
fair value of the asset. When an impairment loss is recognized,
the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated
fair value. As a result of Intevacs projected undiscounted
future cash flows related to certain of its intangible assets
being less than the carrying value of those assets, Intevac
recorded an impairment charge of $808,000 in fiscal 2008. No
impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2009.   Income
Taxes   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted
tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book
and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely
than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized.   On a quarterly basis, Intevac provides for income taxes based
upon an annual effective income tax rate. The effective tax rate
is highly dependent upon the level of Intevacs projected
earnings, the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax
regulations governing each region, net operating loss
carryforwards, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness
of Intevacs tax planning strategies. Intevac carefully
monitors the changes in many factors and adjust its effective
income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from
the estimates, this could have a material effect on
Intevacs business, financial condition and results of
operations.   The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
inconsistent with Intevacs expectations could have a
material effect on Intevacs business, financial condition
and results of operations.   Intevac recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.   Sales
and Value Added Taxes   Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Revenue
Recognition   Intevac recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title and risk of
loss have passed to Intevacs customer or services have
been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Intevacs shipping
terms are customarily FOB shipping point or equivalent terms.
Intevacs revenue recognition policy generally results in
revenue recognition at the following points: 1for all
transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon
shipment, Intevac recognizes revenue upon shipment for all
products that have been demonstrated to meet product
specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue
associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred
based on the estimated fair value, and that revenue is
recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks;
2for products that have not been demonstrated to meet
product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized
at customer acceptance; and 3for arrangements containing
multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered
elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of
the deferred elements. In certain cases, technology upgrade
sales are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements usually
split between delivery of the parts and installation on   
45 Table of Contents   the customers systems. In these cases, Intevac recognizes
revenue for the fair market value of the parts upon shipment and
transfer of title, and recognizes revenue for the fair market
value of installation services when those services are
completed. Revenue related to sales of spare parts is generally
recognized upon shipment. Revenue related to services is
generally recognized upon completion of the services.   Intevac performs research and development work under various
government-sponsored research contracts. Revenue on
cost-plus-fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs
actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned.
Intevac considers fixed fees under cost-plus-fee contracts to be
earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in
performance of the contract. Revenue on fixed-price contracts is
generally recognized using the
percentage-of-completion
method of contract accounting. Intevac determines the percentage
completed based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in
relation to total estimated costs expected upon completion of
the contract. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a
contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a
provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the
period the loss is determined.   Advertising
Costs   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
were not material for all periods presented.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The functional currency of Intevacs foreign subsidiaries,
with the exception of Hong Kong, is the local currency of the
country in which the respective subsidiary operates. Hong
Kongs functional currency is the U.S.dollar. Assets
and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at
year-end exchange rates; revenues and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates during the year. The effect of foreign
currency translation adjustments are included in
stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. The effects of foreign currency transactions are
included in other income in the determination of net income. Net
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions were
$226,000, $31,000 and $62,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.   Comprehensive

Stock Plans   Intevac has equity-based compensation plans that provide for the
grant to employees of equity-based awards, including incentive
or non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares.
In addition, these plans provide for the grant of non-statutory
stock options to non-employee directors and consultants. Intevac
also has an employee stock purchase plan, which provides
Intevacs employees with the opportunity to purchase
Intevac common stock at a discount through payroll deductions.
See Note2 for a complete description of these plans and
their accounting treatment.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In January 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC issued Release
No33-9002,
Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting. The
final rule requires companies to provide their financial
statements and financial statement schedules to the SEC and on
their corporate websites in interactive data format using the   
46 Table of Contents   eXtensible Business Reporting Language XBRL. The
rule was adopted by the SEC to improve the ability of financial
statement users to access and analyze financial data. The SEC
adopted a phase-in schedule indicating when registrants must
furnish interactive data. Under this schedule, Intevac will be
required to submit filings with financial statement information
using XBRL commencing with its June25, 2011 quarterly
report on
Form10-Q.
Intevac is currently evaluating the impact of XBRL reporting on
its financial reporting process.   In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB amended revenue recognition guidance for
arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance eliminates
the residual method of revenue recognition and allows the use of
managements best estimate of selling price for individual
elements of an arrangement when vendor specific objective
evidence VSOE, vendor objective evidence
VOE or third-party evidence TPE is
unavailable. This guidance should be applied on a prospective
basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June15,
2010, with early adoption permitted. Full retrospective
application of the guidance is optional. Intevac is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements.   In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance which amends the scope
of existing software revenue recognition accounting. Tangible
products containing software components and non-software
components that function together to deliver the products
essential functionality would be scoped out of the accounting
guidance on software and accounted for based on other
appropriate revenue recognition guidance. This guidance should
be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements
entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on
or after June15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Full
retrospective application of the new guidance is optional. This
guidance must be adopted in the same period that Intevac adopts
the amended accounting for arrangements with multiple
deliverables described in the preceding paragraph. Intevac is
currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its
consolidated financial statements.   In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies and
provides additional disclosure requirements related to recurring
and non-recurring fair value measurements. Intevac must
implement these new requirements in its first quarter of fiscal
2010. Certain additional disclosures about purchases, sales,
issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in
Level3 fair value measures are not effective until fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2010. Other than
requiring additional disclosures, implementation of this new
guidance will not have a material impact on Intevacs
consolidated financial statements.

Equity-Based
Compensation   Intevac accounts for share-based awards in accordance with the
provisions of the revised accounting guidance which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards made to employees, consultants and
directors based upon the grant-date fair value of those awards.
The estimated fair value of Intevacs equity-based awards,
less expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards
service periods using the graded vesting attribution method.
During the years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
Intevac recognized equity-based compensation expense related to
stock options and shares issued pursuant to its ESPP of
$43million, $66million and $63million,
respectively.   Descriptions
of Plans   2004
Equity Incentive Plan   In 2004, the Board of Directors and Intevac stockholders
approved adoption of The 2004 Equity Incentive Plan the
2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan serves as the successor
equity incentive program to the 1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance
Plan the 1995 Plan. Upon adoption of the 2004
Plan, all remaining shares available for issuance under the 1995
Plan were transferred to the 2004 Plan.   The 2004 Plan is a broad-based, long-term retention program
intended to attract and retain qualified management and
employees, and align stockholder and employee interests. The
2004 Plan permits the grant of incentive or non-statutory stock
options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and performance shares. To date only stock
options have been issued pursuant to the 2004 Plan. Option
price, vesting period, and other terms are determined by the
administrator of the 2004 Plan, but the option price shall
generally not   
47 Table of Contents   be less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date
of grant. As of December31, 2009, 36million shares
of common stock were authorized for future issuance under the
2004 Plan. Options granted under the 2004 Plan are exercisable
upon vesting and vest over periods of up to five years. Options
currently expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
The 2004 Plan expires no later than March10, 2014.   During the year ended December31, 2009, Intevac granted
536,000 stock options pursuant to the 2004 Plan with an
estimated total grant-date fair value of $14million. Of
this amount, Intevac estimated that the equity-based
compensation for option grants that will be forfeited, and are
therefore not expected to vest, was $319,000. During the year
ended December31, 2008, Intevac granted 697,000 stock
options pursuant to the 2004 Plan with an estimated total
grant-date fair value of $43million, including
7,500shares granted to a consultant with a grant date fair
value of $50,000. Of this amount, Intevac estimated that the
equity-based compensation for option grants that will be
forfeited, and are therefore not expected to vest, was $904,000.
During the year ended December31, 2007, Intevac granted
750,000 stock options with an estimated total grant-date fair
value of $74million, including 3,000shares granted
to a consultant with a grant date fair value of $24,000. Of this
amount, Intevac estimated that the equity-based compensation for
option grants that will be forfeited, and are therefore not
expected to vest, was $16million.   2003
Employee Stock Purchase Plan   In 2003, Intevacs stockholders approved adoption of the
2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP, which
serves as the successor to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
originally adopted in 1995. Upon adoption of the ESPP, all
shares available for issuance under the prior plan were
transferred to the ESPP. The ESPP provides that eligible
employees may purchase Intevac common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning of the applicable offering period
or at the end of each applicable purchase interval. Offering
periods are generally two years in length, and consist of a
series of six-month purchase intervals. Eligible employees may
join the ESPP at the beginning of any six-month purchase
interval. Under the terms of the ESPP, employees can choose to
have up to 10% of their base earnings withheld to purchase
Intevac common stock. Under the ESPP, Intevac sold 240,000,
166,000 and 90,000shares to employees in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. As of December31, 2009,
491,000shares remained available for issuance under the
ESPP. During the years ended December31, 2009, 2008, and
2007 Intevac granted purchase rights with an estimated total
grant-date fair value of $328,000, $10million and
$20million, respectively.   The effect of recording equity-based compensation for the years
ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows in

respectively.   
48 Table of Contents   Stock
Options   The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price
of Intevacs stock on the date of grant. Most options are
scheduled to vest over four years and expire no later than ten
years after the grant date. The fair value of each option grant
is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating
the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. Intevacs employee
stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of publicly traded options. The weighted average
assumptions used in the model are outlined in the following
table   	
2009   2008   2007   Stock Options   Expected volatility   6717     6560     6667     Risk free interest rate   201     287     405     Expected term of options in years   447   447   449   Dividend yield   None   None   None   The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on
historical volatility of Intevacs stock price. The
risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on
U.S.Treasury Strips with an equivalent remaining term. The
expected life of employee stock options represents the
weighted-average period that the stock options are expected to
remain outstanding and was determined based on historical
experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the
contractual terms of the stock-based awards and vesting
schedules. The dividend yield assumption is based on
Intevacs history of not paying dividends and the
assumption of not paying dividends in the future.   The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock
options granted during the years ended December31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 was $257, $612 and $989 per share, respectively.   ESPP   The fair value of the employee stock purchase right is estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions   	
2009   2008   2007   Stock Purchase Rights   Expected volatility   8256     6265     6315     Risk free interest rate   085     168     394     Expected term of purchase rights in years   185   187   197   Dividend yield   None   None   None   The expected life of purchase rights is the period of time
remaining in the current offering period. The weighted-average
estimated fair value of employee stock purchase rights granted
pursuant to the ESPP during the years ended December31,
2009, 2008 and 2007 was $273, $540 and $823 per share,
respectively.

491,000shares available to be issued under the ESPP. As of
December31, 2009, Intevac had $306,000 of total
unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures
related to purchase rights that will be recognized over the
weighted average period of 05years.

Earnings
Per Share   Intevac calculates basic earnings per share EPS
using net income loss and the weighted-average number of
shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS
includes the effect from potential issuance of common stock
pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options.   The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted income loss per share

Potentially dilutive securities, consisting of shares issuable
upon exercise of employee stock options, are excluded from the
calculation of diluted EPS if their effect would be
anti-dilutive. The weighted average number of employee stock
options excluded from the twelve-month periods ended
December31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was 3,150,397, 2,760,874,
and 784,684 respectively.   
4.
Concentrations   Credit
Risk and Significant Customers   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash
equivalents, short- and long-term investments, and accounts
receivable. Intevac generally invests its excess cash in money
market funds, ARS and debt securities of the
U.S.government and its agencies. By policy, investments in
money market funds and ARS are rated AAA or better, and Intevac
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.   Intevacs accounts receivable tend to be concentrated in a
limited number of customers. At December31, 2009, two
customers accounted for 47% and 35%, respectively, of
Intevacs accounts receivable and in aggregate accounted
for 82% of net accounts receivable. At December31, 2008,
two customers accounted for 40% and 11%, respectively, of
Intevacs accounts receivable and in aggregate accounted
for 51% of net accounts receivable.   Intevacs largest customers tend to change from period to
period. Historically, a significant portion of Intevacs
revenues in any particular period have been attributable to
sales to a limited number of customers. In 2009, two customers
accounted for 38% and 17%, respectively, of consolidated net
revenues and in aggregate accounted for 55% of net revenues. In
2008, two customers accounted for 35% and 34%, respectively, of
consolidated net revenues and in aggregate accounted for 69% of
net revenues. In 2007, four customers accounted for 31%, 23   23% and 13%, respectively, of consolidated net revenues and in
aggregate accounted for 90% of net revenues. Intevac performs
credit evaluations of its customers financial condition
and generally requires deposits on system orders but does not
generally require collateral or other security to support
customer receivables.   Products   Disk manufacturing products contributed a significant portion of
Intevacs revenues in 2009, 2008, and 2007. Intevac expects
that the ability to maintain or expand its current levels of
revenues in the future will depend upon continuing market demand
for its products; its success in enhancing its existing systems
and developing and   
51 Table of Contents   manufacturing competitive disk manufacturing equipment, such as
the 200 Lean; Intevacs success in developing both military
and commercial products based on its low-light technology; and
its success in utilizing Intevacs expertise in complex
manufacturing equipment to develop new equipment products for
photovoltaic PV and semiconductor manufacturing.

impairment on an annual basis or more frequently upon the
occurrence of circumstances that indicate that goodwill and
indefinite life intangible assets may be impaired. Intevac
conducted these impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2009 and the results of these tests indicated that
Intevacs goodwill and purchased intangible asset with an
indefinite useful live were not impaired.   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company experienced a
significant decline in its stock price. As a result of the
decline in its stock price, the Companys market
capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of
its consolidated net assets. Based on the results of its
assessment of goodwill for impairment, Intevac determined that
the fair value of its Equipment reporting unit was less than the
carrying value and impairment existed. Therefore, Intevac
performed the second step of the impairment test to determine
the implied fair value of goodwill. The analysis indicated that
there would be no remaining implied value attributable to
goodwill in the Equipment reporting unit and accordingly,
Intevac wrote off all $97million of goodwill in its
Equipment reporting unit. The goodwill associated with the
Intevac Photonics reporting unit was not impaired.   Information regarding other acquisition-related intangible

53 Table of Contents   During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 Intevac performed
an impairment test on intangible assets and determined that
certain purchased technology assets in the Equipment and Intevac
Photonics segments were impaired due to lower revenue
expectations and future operating expectations. The
determination was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash
flows for these intangible assets, which were less than their
carrying values. As a result, Intevac recorded an impairment
charge of $808,000 in fiscal 2008, which represented the
difference between the estimated fair values of these intangible
assets as compared to their carrying fair values which were
determined based upon market conditions, the income approach
which utilized cash flow projections, and other factors.   Total amortization expense of purchased intangibles for the
years ended December31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $554,000,
$700,000 and $218,000 respectively. Future amortization expense
is expected to be $552,000 for 2010, $541,000 for 2011, $541,000
for 2012, $541,000 for 2013, $363,000 for 2014 and $879,000
thereafter. Intangible assets by segment as of December31,
2009 are as follows: Equipment; $24million and Intevac
Photonics; $11million.

Business
Combinations   On July14, 2008, Intevac acquired certain assets and
liabilities of OC Oerlikon Balzers Ltd.
Oerlikons magnetic media equipment business
for a purchase price of $151million in cash, net of cash
acquired. In addition Intevac agreed to pay contingent
consideration to Oerlikon in the form of a royalty on
Intevacs net revenue from commercial sales of certain
products. This agreement terminates on July13, 2011.
Intevac has made no payments to Oerlikon under this agreement
through December31, 2009. As part of the acquisition,
Intevac also entered into a settlement agreement with Oerlikon
related to a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Intevac
against Unaxis USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Oerlikon,
and all claims in the litigation were dismissed.   In connection with this acquisition, Intevac recorded goodwill
of $98million and intangible assets of $38million.
Of the $38million of acquired intangible assets,
$26million was assigned to customer relationships to be
amortized over 6 to 9years, $12million was
assigned to purchased technology to be amortized over 3 to
7years and $80,000 was assigned to acquired backlog to
be amortized over 1year. Future contingent payments will
also be allocated to goodwill.   On November9, 2007, Intevac acquired the assets and
certain liabilities of Creative Display Systems, LLC
CDS for a purchase price of $48million in
cash, net of cash acquired. The acquired business is a supplier
of high-performance micro-display products for near-eye and
portable applications in defense and commercial markets. In
connection with this acquisition, Intevac recorded goodwill of
$25million and intangible assets of $16million. Of
the $16million of acquired intangible assets, $890,000
was assigned to purchased technology to be amortized over
10years, $560,000 was assigned to customer relationships
to be amortized over 13years, $110,000 was assigned to
acquired backlog to be amortized over 1year, and $40,000
was assigned to covenants not to compete to be amortized over
3years.   On January31, 2007, Intevac acquired the assets and
certain liabilities of DeltaNu, LLC DeltaNu for a
purchase price of $58million of which $20million
was paid in cash at the close of the acquisition,
$20million was paid on January31, 2008 and
$20million was paid on January31, 2009, which was
in the form of a non interest-bearing note. Interest was
imputed, and the related note payable was recorded at a discount
in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquired
business is a supplier of small footprint and handheld Raman
spectrometry instruments. In connection with this acquisition,
Intevac recorded goodwill of $54million, an
indefinite-life tradename of $120,000 and amortizable intangible
assets of $280,000 which are comprised of customer
relationships, covenants not to compete and backlog to be
amortized over their respective useful lives of 1-2years.   The results of operations for the acquired businesses have been
included in Intevacs consolidated statements of operations
for the periods subsequent to their respective acquisition
dates. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented
because the effects of the acquisitions, individually and in
aggregate, were not material.

Financial
Instruments   Intevacs investment portfolio consists of cash, cash
equivalents and investments in ARS and debt securities of the
U.S.government and its agencies. Included in accounts
payable is $722,000 and $916,000 of book overdraft at
December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.   The table below presents the estimated fair value or amortized
principal amount and major security type for Intevacs
investments

utilizing Level1 inputs were valued based on quoted market
prices in active markets for identical securities and included
money market funds in the amount of $93million and
U.S.Treasury Bills in the amount of $60million.   As of December31, 2009, Intevacs investment
portfolio included $700million par value in ARS. All of
the ARS are student loan structured issues, where the loans have
been originated under the U.S.Department of
Educations Federal Family Education Loan Program. The
principal and interest are
97-98%
reinsured by the U.S.Department of Education and the
collateral ratios range from 102% to 115%. Securities with a par
value of $577 million are rated AAA/Aaa, securities with a par
value of $93million are rated AAA/A3 and a security with
a par value of $30million is rated AAA/Baa3. These
investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in
February 2008. The investments in ARS will not be accessible
until a successful auction occurs, they are restructured into a
more liquid security, a buyer is found outside of the auction
process, or the underlying securities have matured.   As of December31, 2009, there was insufficient observable
market information for the ARS held by Intevac to determine the
fair value. Therefore Level3 fair values were estimated
for these securities by incorporating assumptions that market
participants would use in their estimates of fair value. At
December31, 2009, the fair value of the ARS was estimated
at $662million based on a valuation by Houlihan
Smith Company, Inc. using discounted cash flow
models and management applying internal analysis to the
valuation. The estimates of future cash flows are based on
certain key assumptions, such as discount rates appropriate for
the type of asset and risk, which are significant unobservable
inputs. Some of these assumptions included credit quality,
collateralization, final stated maturity, estimates of the
probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final
maturity, redemptions of similar ARS, previous market activity
for the same investment security, impact due to extended periods
of maximum auction rates and valuation models. These securities
are classified as long-term assets, as management believes that
the ARS market will not become liquid within the next year.
Potentially, it could take until the final maturity of the
underlying notes ranging from 23years to 39years
to realize these investments recorded values.   Management believes that the impairment of the ARS investments
is temporary, primarily due to the government guarantee of the
underlying securities and Intevacs ability to hold these
securities for the foreseeable future. Management believes that
it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell
these securities before the recovery of their par amounts. A
temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being
recorded in the other comprehensive income component of
stockholders equity. Such an unrealized loss does not
reduce net income for the applicable accounting period, because
the loss is not viewed as
other-than-temporary.
The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and
other-than-temporary
include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions,
and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying
collateral. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
temporary include length of time and the extent to which the
investments fair value   
55 Table of Contents   has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and
near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events
which may influence the operations of the issuer, and
Intevacs intent and ability to retain the investment for a
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
of fair value. As of December31, 2009, management has no
reason to believe that any of the underlying issuers of
Intevacs ARS or their insurers are presently at risk or
that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing
Intevacs ARS has been impacted by the reduced liquidity of
these investments. As of December31, 2009, based on the
Level3 valuation performed, Intevac determined that there
was a temporary decline in fair value of its ARS of
$37million.   On March19, 2009, Intevac filed a statement of claim under
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority dispute resolution
process against Citigroup Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets,
Inc. collectively, Citigroup with respect to
alleged fraud and market manipulation by Citigroup related to
ARS. The statement of claim requests that Citigroup accept
Intevacs tender of its ARS at par value and that Intevac
receive compensatory, consequential and punitive damages and
costs and expenses. Citigroup responded denying Intevacs
claims. Intevac is currently in the discovery stage of this
matter. An arbitration date of May13, 2010 has been agreed
upon for commencement of the arbitration of this dispute. As of
December31, 2009, the total par amount of ARS held by
Intevac which are subject to the Citigroup claim amounted to
$558million.   The following table presents the changes in Level3
instruments measured on a recurring basis for the years ended
December31, 2009 and 2008. The majority of Intevacs

Equity
Investment   601
California Avenue LLC   In 1995, Intevac entered into a Limited Liability Company
Operating Agreement the Operating Agreement, with
601 California Avenue LLC the LLC, a California
limited liability company formed and owned by Intevac and
certain stockholders of Intevac. Under the Operating Agreement
Intevac transferred its leasehold interest in the site of its
discontinued night vision business in exchange for a Preferred
Share in the LLC with a face value of $39million. During
1996, the LLC formed a joint venture with Stanford University
the Stanford JV to develop and lease the property.
In December 2007, the Stanford JV sold the property, and LLC
redeemed Intevacs $39million Preferred Share.   Intevac accounted for the investment under the cost method and
originally recorded Intevacs investment in the LLC at
$2,431,000, which represented Intevacs historical carrying
value of the leasehold interest in the site. The Company
received dividends of $292,500 in 2007 from LLC. These dividends
and the $1,469,000 gain realized upon redemption of the
Preferred Share in December 2007 were included in other income
and expense.

Borrowing
Facility   On March5, 2008, Intevac entered into an agreement with
Citigroup for a secured revolving loan facility. This loan
facility may be terminated at the discretion of Citigroup and
amounts outstanding are payable on demand. It is secured by
Intevacs ARS held at Citigroup. Approximately
$185million of credit is currently available pursuant to
the loan facility. The interest rate on the loan facility is
prime minus 15percent. No amounts were outstanding under
this credit facility at December31, 2009.

difference related to Intevacs interest in a real estate
investment.   Intevac has not provided for U.S.federal income and
foreign withholding taxes on approximately $134million of
undistributed earnings from
non-U.S.operations
as of December31, 2009 because Intevac intends to reinvest
such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. If
Intevac were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits
may become available under current law to reduce the resulting
U.S.income tax liability. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is
not practicable. Intevac will remit the non-indefinitely
reinvested earnings, if any, of Intevacs
non-U.S.subsidiaries
where excess cash has accumulated and Intevac determines that it
is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash reasons.   Intevac enjoys a tax holiday in Singapore through the tax years
ending in 2015. The tax holiday provides a lower income tax rate
on certain classes of income and the agreement requires that
certain thresholds of business investment and employment levels
be met in Singapore in order to maintain this holiday. As a
result of this incentive, the impact of the tax holiday
decreased income taxes by $12million, $250,000 and
$321,000 in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The benefit of
the tax holiday on net income loss per share diluted was
approximately $006, $001 and $001 in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.   Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at
December31, 2009 and 2008 is $44million and
$28million, respectively of Federal income taxes
receivable which represents amounts available for carryback of
losses. As of December31, 2009, the Company had state NOL
carryforwards available to offset future state taxable income of
approximately $272million that expire between 2010 and
2029. In addition, the Company had various federal and state tax
credit carryforwards combined of approximately
$139million. Approximately $133million of the
credit carryforwards are available to offset future taxable
income and expire between 2026 and 2029. The remaining amount is
available indefinitely. Certain of these carryforwards, when
realized, will be credited to additional paid-in capital.   The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $782,000
as of December31, 2009, of which up to $382,000 would
affect Intevacs effective tax rate if realized. The
aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax
benefits were as follows   	
In thousands   Beginning balance as of December31, 2007     400   Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during
current period   140   Balance as of December31, 2008   540   Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during
current period   242   Balance as of at December31, 2009     782   The unrecognized tax benefits may decrease in the next twelve
months due to examinations by tax authorities. Intevac did not
accrue any interest or penalties related to these unrecognized
tax benefits because Intevac has other tax attributes which
would offset any potential taxes due.   Intevac is subject to income taxes in the U.S.federal
jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax
regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the
interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and
require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions,
Intevac is not subject to U.S.federal, state and local, or
international jurisdictions income tax examinations by tax
authorities for the years before 2004. The Company currently has
a California income tax examination for fiscal years ended 2005,
2006 and 2007. In 2009, the Internal Revenue Service conducted a
field review of the fiscal year 2008 tax return and the
examination is pending approval from the U.S.Joint
Committee on Taxation. Presently, there are no other active
income tax examinations in the jurisdictions where Intevac
operates.

Employee
Benefit Plans   Employee
Savings and Retirement Plan   In 1991, Intevac established a defined contribution retirement
plan with 401k plan features. The plan covers all United
States employees eighteen years and older. Employees may make
contributions by a percentage reduction in their salaries, not
to exceed the statutorily prescribed annual limit. Intevac made
cash contributions of $109,000 $541,000 and $481,000 for the
years ended December31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively. Employees may choose among several investment
options for their contributions and their share of
Intevacs contributions, and they are able to move funds
between investment options at any time. Intevacs common
stock is not one of the investment options. Administrative
expenses relating to the plan are insignificant.   Employee
Bonus Plans   Intevac has various employee bonus plans.A
profit-sharing plan provides for the distribution of a
percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially all of
Intevacs employees not eligible for other
performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of
compensation. Other plans award annual or quarterly bonuses to
Intevacs executives and key contributors based on the
achievement of profitability and other specific performance
criteria. There were no charges to expense under these plans for
the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008. Charges to
expense under these plans were $52million for the year
ended December31, 2007.

Commitments
and Contingencies   Leases   Intevac leases certain facilities under non-cancelable operating
leases that expire at various times up to February 2013. Certain
of Intevacs leases contain provisions for rental
adjustments, including a provision based on increases in the Bay
Area Consumer Price Index. Included in other long-term assets on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets is $843,000 of prepaid rent
related to the effective rent on Intevacs long-term lease
for Intevacs SantaClara facility. The facility
leases require Intevac to pay for all normal maintenance costs.
Gross rental expense was approximately $34million,
$32million, and $33million for the years ended
December31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Future
minimum lease payments at December31, 2009 totaled
$54million and were: $23million for fiscal 2010;
$22million for fiscal 2011; $788,000 for fiscal 2012; and
$104,000 for fiscal 2013.   Guarantees   Officer
and Director Indemnifications   As permitted or required under Delaware law and to the maximum
extent allowable under that law, Intevac has certain obligations
to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for
certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is,
or was serving, at Intevacs request in such capacity.
These indemnification obligations are valid as long as the
director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the
person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or
her conduct was unlawful. The maximum potential amount of future
payments Intevac could be required to make under these
indemnification obligations is unlimited; however, Intevac has a
director and officer insurance policy that mitigates
Intevacs exposure and enables Intevac to recover a portion
of any future amounts paid. As a result of Intevacs
insurance policy coverage, Intevac believes the estimated fair
value of these indemnification obligations is not material.   Other
Indemnifications   As is customary in Intevacs industry, many of
Intevacs contracts provide remedies to certain third
parties such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for
intellectual property claims related to the use of its products.
Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum
loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these
indemnifications have been immaterial.   
60 Table of Contents   Warranty   Intevac provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
is recognized. Intevacs warranty is per contract terms and
for its systems the warranty typically ranges between 12 and
24months from customer acceptance. For systems sold
through a distributor, Intevac offers a 3month warranty.
The remainder of any warranty period is the responsibility of
the distributor. During this warranty period any defective
non-consumable parts are replaced and installed at no charge to
the customer. The warranty period on consumable parts is limited
to their reasonable usable lives. Intevac uses estimated repair
or replacement costs along with its historical warranty
experience to determine its warranty obligation. Intevac
generally provides a twelve month warranty on its Intevac
Photonics products. The provision for the estimated future
costs of warranty is based upon historical cost and product
performance experience. Intevac exercises judgment in
determining the underlying estimates.   On the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the short-term portion of the
warranty provision is included in other accrued liabilities,
while the long-term portion is included in other long-term
liabilities. The expense associated with product warranties
issued or adjusted is included in cost of net revenues on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.   The following table displays the activity in the warranty

Matters   From time to time, Intevac receives notification from third
parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking
indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other
actions in connection with claims made against them. In
addition, from time to time, Intevac receives notification from
third parties claiming that Intevac may be or is infringing
their intellectual property or other rights. Intevac also is
subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both
asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of
business. Although the outcome of these claims and proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty, Intevac does not believe
that any of these other existing proceedings or claims will have
a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.   On March19, 2009, Intevac filed a statement of claim under
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority dispute resolution
process against Citigroup Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets,
Inc. collectively, Citigroup with respect to
alleged fraud and market manipulation by Citigroup related to
auction rate securities. The statement of claim requests that
Citigroup accept Intevacs tender of its auction rate
securities at par value and that Intevac receive compensatory,
consequential and punitive damages and costs and expenses.
Citigroup responded denying Intevacs claims. Intevac is
currently in the discovery stage of this matter. An arbitration
date of May13, 2010 has been agreed upon for commencement
of the arbitration of this dispute.

and Geographic Information   Intevacs two reportable segments are: Equipment and
Intevac Photonics. Effective in the second quarter of 2008,
Intevac renamed the Imaging Instrumentation segment to Intevac
Photonics. Intevacs chief operating decision-maker has
been identified as the President and CEO, who reviews operating
results to make decisions about allocating resources and
assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment

distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this
internal financial structure may result in changes to the
reportable segments disclosed.   Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate
financial results that are reviewed by Intevacs chief
operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains
closely related products that are unique to the particular
segment. Segment operating profit is determined based upon
internal performance measures used by the chief operating
decision-maker.   Intevac derives the segment results from its internal management
reporting system. The accounting policies Intevac uses to derive
reportable segment results are substantially the same as those
used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the
performance of each reportable segment based upon several
metrics, including orders, net revenues and operating income.
Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of,
and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.
Intevac manages certain operating expenses separately at the
corporate level. Intevac allocates certain of these corporate
expenses to the segments in an amount equal to 3% of net
revenues. Segment operating income excludes interest
income/expense and other financial charges and income taxes
according to how a particular reportable segments
management is measured. Management does not consider impairment
charges and unallocated costs in measuring the performance of
the reportable segments.   The Equipment segment designs, develops and markets
manufacturing equipment and solutions to the hard disk drive
industry and offers high-productivity technology solutions to
the PV and semiconductor industries. In 2009, the Equipment
segment began offering high-productivity thin film solar cell
manufacturing equipment to PV cell manufacturers. Historically,
the majority of Intevacs revenue has been derived from the
Equipment segment and Intevac expects that the majority of its
revenues for the next several years will continue to be derived
from the Equipment segment.   The Intevac Photonics segment develops compact, cost-effective,
high-sensitivity digital-optical products for the capture and
display of low-light images and the optical analysis of
materials. Intevac provides sensors, cameras and systems for
government applications such as night vision and long-range
target identification and for commercial applications in the
inspection, law enforcement, scientific and medical industries.   Information for each reportable segment for the years ended

Report on Assessment of Internal Controls Over Financial

of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Based on Intevacs managements evaluation with the
participation of Intevacs chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by
this report, Intevacs chief executive officer and chief
financial officer have concluded that Intevacs disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the
Exchange Act are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Intevac in reports that
Intevac files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms
and is accumulated and communicated to Intevacs
management, including Intevacs chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.   Managements
Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting for Intevac.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: ipertain to
the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the Company; iiprovide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Management with the participation of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of
the effectiveness of Intevacs internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that
Intevacs internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2009. Grant Thornton LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the
effectiveness of Intevacs internal control over financial
reporting and has issued a report on Intevacs internal
control over financial reporting, which is included in their
report on the following page.   Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, Intevacs internal control over financial reporting.   
65 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   Board of Directors and Stockholders   Intevac, Inc.   We have audited Intevac, Inc. a Delaware corporation and
subsidiaries collectively, the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, Intevac, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by COSO.   We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Intevac Inc. as of
December31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2009. Our
audits of the basic financial statements included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
a. Our report dated February26, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements and schedule.   /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP   SanJose, California   February26, 2010
