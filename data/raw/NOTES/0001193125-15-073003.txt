REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 
Managements Report on Financial Information and Procedures 
The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These financial statements
were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applying certain estimates and judgments as required. 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives
will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2014 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances and may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and
procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein. 
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 excluded the
nine acquisitions we completed in 2014. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in managements report on internal control over financial reporting, provided the
acquisition took place within twelve months of managements evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 97% of our consolidated assets at December31, 2014 and 40% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended
December31, 2014.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc.: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash
flows and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2014 and December31, 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on
our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded its 2014 acquisitions from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014 because these acquisitions were made by the Company through purchase business combinations during 2014. We have also excluded the Companys 2014 acquisitions
from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The 2014 acquisitions of the Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and have total assets and revenues which represent approximately 97% and
40%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31, 2014. /s/

regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and certain state public utility commissions. The Fiber Optic Licensing and Other segment also provides various telecommunication
infrastructure services on a limited and ancillary basis, primarily to Quantas customers in the electric power industry. 
Acquisitions 
During 2014, Quanta completed nine acquisitions, which enabled Quanta to further enhance its electric power and oil and gas infrastructure

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the accounts of Quanta Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which are also
referred to as its operating units. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of certain of Quantas investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, as discussed in the
following summary of significant accounting policies. Investments in affiliated entities in which Quanta does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which Quanta has significant influence, usually because Quanta holds a voting interest
of between 20% and 50%, are accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta Services,
Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Use of Estimates and Assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with USGAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in
determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during
the periods presented. Quanta reviews all

are based on Quantas beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial
statements. Estimates are primarily used in Quantas assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset
impairments, equity and other investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims and guarantees, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts
inclusive of contractual change orders and claims, revenue recognition for fiber optic licensing, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, as well as the provision for income taxes and the calculation of uncertain tax
positions. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $1905 million and $4888 million as of December31, 2014 and 2013. Cash consisting of
interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents, which are carried at
fair value. At December31, 2014 and 2013, cash equivalents were $1076 million and $2478 million and consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and are discussed further in Fair Value Measurements below. As of December31,
2014 and 2013, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $1272 million and $2367 million, and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were approximately $633 million and $2521 million. As of
December31, 2014 and 2013, cash and cash equivalents held by Quantas investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, were approximately $191 million and $189 million. Quanta has no rights
with respect to the joint ventures cash except as permitted pursuant to their respective partnership agreements. Current and
Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts
when collection of an account or note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and
estimates regarding, among other factors, the customers access to capital, the customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions, the ongoing relationship with the customer and uncertainties related to the
resolution of disputed matters. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent after 30days but does not generally include delinquent accounts in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been
outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances that have been outstanding for 90days or more, Quanta also includes accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in its analysis
of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Material changes in Quantas customers business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market conditions, could affect Quantas ability to collect amounts due from them.
As of December31, 2014 and 2013, Quanta had allowances for doubtful accounts on current receivables of approximately $62 million and $52 million. 
Long-term accounts receivable are included within other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Within this balance at
December31, 2013 was a long-term contract receivable previously recorded in the amount of approximately $165 million attributable to recognized contract price adjustments related to a change order from the Sunrise Powerlink project, an
electric power infrastructure services project completed in 2012 by PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc. PAR, a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, for San Diego Gas and Electric Company SDGE. This receivable was the subject of a recently
settled arbitration proceeding discussed further 
92 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
in Legal Proceedings Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration in Note 15. In December 2014, the parties reached an agreement to settle the arbitration under terms providing for a cash payment
by SDGE to PAR in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate PAR for substantially all of the unpaid portion of its costs incurred on the project.Accordingly, a provision of $1025 million was recognized in
2014 as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense, and the remaining balance of $65 million was reclassified to accounts receivable, leaving no balance remaining in other assets, net related to the Sunrise Powerlink project as of
December31, 2014. Payment was received in January 2015, and the arbitration was dismissedshortlythereafter. Should
customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and
losses in excess of current allowances provided. The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in
certain contracts are generally due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on Quantas experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are
expected to be collected within the next twelve months. Current retainage balances as of December31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $3073 million and $1945 million and were included in accounts receivable. Retainage balances with
settlement dates beyond the next twelve months were included in other assets, net, and as of December31, 2014 and 2013 were $196 million and $508 million. 
Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when revenues have been earned and recorded but
the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing for example, work completed one
month but not billed until the next month. These balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts.
At December31, 2014 and 2013, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were approximately $1655 million and $1792 million. 
Inventories 
Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary course of business, which are valued by Quanta at the lower of
cost or market as determined by using either the first-in, first-out FIFO method or the average costing method. Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet installed which are valued using the specific identification method.
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated salvage values, over
the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was
approximately $1581 million, $1341 million and $1203 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Quanta capitalizes costs associated with internally developed or constructed assets primarily associated with fiber optic licensing networks.
Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use assets, as well as payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who 
93 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
are directly associated with and devote time to placing the assets into service. Capitalization of such costs is recorded to construction work-in-process beginning when the preliminary project
stage is complete and ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose, at which point in time the asset is placed into service. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, approximately
$306 million and $324 million related to fiber optic licensing networks were recorded in construction work-in-process. These capitalized costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the economic useful life of the asset, beginning when the
asset is ready for its intended use. Accrued capital expenditures were $118 million and $06 million as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the impact of these items has been excluded from Quantas capital expenditures on its consolidated
statements of cash flows due to their non-cash nature. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred.
Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment,
the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
realizable. Although no such events occurred during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, if an evaluation is required, management would assess whether the carrying value of the asset group is recoverable by comparing the sum of the
undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group. If the asset is not recoverable, management compares the estimated fair value of the asset to the assets carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is
necessary. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its carrying value in the period incurred. 
Other Assets, Net 
Other assets, net consists primarily of long-term receivables, debt issuance costs, non-current inventory, equity and other investments,
refundable security deposits for leased properties and insurance claims in excess of deductibles that are due from Quantas insurers. Included in the long-term receivables balance at December31, 2013 was approximately $165 million related
to the Sunrise Powerlink project. In 2014, Quanta recorded $1025 million to provision for long-term contract receivable associated with the Sunrise Powerlink project receivable. The remaining balance of $65 million was reclassified to accounts
receivable in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of the settlement of the arbitration in December 2014 and collection of the receivable in January 2015. Accordingly, as of December31, 2014, there was no balance remaining in other assets,
net related to the Sunrise Powerlink project. For additional information on this receivable and the associated arbitration proceeding, see Legal Proceedings Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration in Note 15. 
Debt Issuance Costs 
Capitalized debt issuance costs related to Quantas credit facility and any other debt outstanding at a given balance sheet date are
included in other assets, net and are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the debt issuance costs, which Quanta believes approximates the effective interest rate method.
During 2013, Quanta incurred $32 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendment and restatement of its credit agreement and recorded $02 million of charges to interest expense for the write-off of a portion of the debt issuance costs
related to the prior facilities. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, capitalized debt issuance costs were $76 million, with accumulated amortization of $35 million 
94 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
and $24 million. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs was $11 million, $11 million and $09 million,
respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its historical acquisitions of companies. Upon acquisition, these companies have been either
combined into one of Quantas existing operating units or managed on a stand-alone basis as an individual operating unit. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is subject to an annual assessment for impairment, which Quanta
performs at the operating unit level for each operating unit that carries a balance of goodwill. Each of Quantas operating units is organized into one of three internal divisions: the Electric Power Division, the Oil and Gas Infrastructure
Division or the Fiber Optic Licensing Division. As most of the companies acquired by Quanta provide multiple types of services for multiple types of customers, these divisional designations are based on the predominant type of work performed by each
operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for
which discrete financial information is available. Quanta has determined that its individual operating units represent its reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments. 
Quanta has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step fair value-based
impairment test described below. If Quanta believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required.
Otherwise, no further testing is required. Quanta can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. Quanta can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed
directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. Qualitative indicators including deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, declining financial performance, or a sustained
decrease in share price, among other things, may trigger the need for annual or interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of the reporting units. 
Quantas goodwill impairment assessment is performed at year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate that
goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease in Quantas market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or loss of a significant customer, as well as the qualitative indicators referenced above, may
trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill for one or all of its reporting units. The first step of the two-step fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units with its carrying
value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of its
goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense. 
Quanta determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market
capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in managements opinion, this method currently results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value. Determining the
fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future
market conditions, among others. Quanta believes the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different
calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. 
95 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Under the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair value based on the estimated
future cash flows of each reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn.
Cash flow projections are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts typically a one-year model plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each
reporting unit using growth rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur, along with a terminal value derived from the reporting units earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. The EBITDA
multiples for each reporting unit are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data. Under the market multiple and market
capitalization approaches, Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting units projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical
calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly
transaction between market participants. The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting unit were used to determine
fair value under the three approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of Quantas reporting units at December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012:

For recently acquired reporting units, a step one impairment test may indicate an implied fair value that is
substantially similar to the reporting units carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication that managements estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively
consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2014, a two-step fair-value
based goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of Quantas reporting units, and no reporting units were evaluated solely on a qualitative basis. The analysis indicated that the implied fair value of each of Quantas reporting
units, other than recently acquired reporting units, was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated at any reporting unit. As discussed generally above, when
evaluating the 2014 step one impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market
conditions and the economic environment in which Quantas reporting units were operating. Additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions and, after giving
consideration to at least a 10% decrease in the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units, the 
96 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
results of the assessment at December31, 2014 did not change. However, circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the loss of a major customer or other factors
could impact the valuation of goodwill in future periods. The goodwill analysis performed for each reporting unit was based on estimates
and industry comparables obtained from the electric power, oil and gas and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The 15-year discounted cash flow model used for fiber optic licensing is based on the long-term nature of
the underlying fiber optic network licensing agreements. Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all
periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a held and used model. As stated previously, cash flows are derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts that have been evaluated by management. In
connection with the 2014 assessment, projected annual growth rates by reporting unit varied widely with ranges from 0% to 71% for reporting units in the Electric Power and the Oil and Gas Divisions and 4% to 12% for the reporting unit in the Fiber
Optic Licensing Division. Quantas intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements,
patented rights and developed technology, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the value-in-use
concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to
customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to Quantas business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta values backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based
upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method
of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset. 
Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible asset, or on a
straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of intangible
assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. 
Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
In the normal course of business, Quanta enters into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms and conditions. These
investments may include equity interests held by Quanta in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures, or other forms of equity participation. These investments may also include Quantas
participation in different financing structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project specific entities, or other strategic financing arrangements. Quanta determines
whether such investments involve a variable interest entity VIE based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then management determines if Quanta is the primary beneficiary of the entity and whether
or not consolidation of the VIE is 
97 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally have both ithe power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIEs economic
performance and iithe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is
consolidated and the other partys equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a non-controlling interest. In cases where Quanta determines that it has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an
unincorporated VIE e.g., a general partnership interest, such amounts are consolidated on a basis proportional to Quantas ownership interest in the unincorporated entity. 
Investments in entities of which Quanta is not the primary beneficiary, but over which Quanta has the ability to exercise significant
influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Quantas share of net income or losses from unconsolidated equity investments is included in equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated
statements of operations when applicable. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors
such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. Any impairment losses would be
recognized in other expense. Equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for Quantas proportionate share of the investees income, losses
and distributions. On December6, 2013, Quanta sold all of its equity ownership interest in Howard Midstream Energy Partners, LLC
HEP for proceeds of approximately $2209 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1127 million. HEP is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing midstream plant and pipeline assets in the oil and gas
industry. Quanta held an equity ownership interest of approximately 31% in HEP. Revenue Recognition 
Infrastructure Services Through its Electric Power Infrastructure Services and Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segments,
Quanta designs, installs and maintains networks for customers in the electric power and oil and gas industries. These services may be provided pursuant to master service agreements, repair and maintenance contracts and fixed price and non-fixed
price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly or time and materials basis or fixed price or lump sum basis, and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated
with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue as units are completed based on pricing established between Quanta
and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under cost-plus/hourly and time and materials type contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue on an input basis, as labor
hours are incurred and services are performed. Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion
method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of
progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed, hours expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those
indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Much of the material associated with Quantas work is owner-furnished and
98 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
is therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on professional knowledge and experience of Quantas engineers, project managers and financial
professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence managements assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts and therefore
Quantas profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. These factors are routinely evaluated on a project by
project basis throughout the project term, and the impact of corresponding revisions in managements estimates of contract value, contract cost and contract profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which the revisions are determined.
Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Quantas operating results for the year ended December31, 2014 and 2013
were impacted by less than 5% as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December31, 2013 and 2012. 
The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenues recognized in
excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed price contracts. 
Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts.
Quanta determines the probability that such costs will be recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost
of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. 
As of December31, 2014 and 2013, Quanta had approximately $1068 million and $755 million of change orders and/or claims that had been
included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. 
As of December31, 2013 and throughout most of 2014, Quanta also had previously recognized contract price adjustments related to a change
order from the Sunrise Powerlink project of approximately $165 million. In October 2013, PAR initiated arbitration proceedings against SDGE pursuant to a contractually agreed upon dispute resolution process to collect amounts due for this
project. In December 2014, Quanta and SDGE reached an agreement to settle the arbitration under terms providing for a cash payment by SDGE in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate Quanta/PAR for
substantially all of the unpaid portion of costs incurred by Quanta/PAR on the project. As a result, during the third and fourth quarters of 2014, Quanta recorded a provision in the aggregate amount of $1025 million against the recorded value of
this asset. See Legal ProceedingsSunrise Powerlink Arbitration in Note 15 for additional information. These aggregate
contract price adjustments represent managements best estimate of additional contract revenues which have been earned and which management believes are probable of collection. The amounts ultimately realized by Quanta upon final acceptance by
its customers could be higher or lower than such estimated amounts. 
99 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Fiber Optic Licensing The fiber optic licensing business constructs and
licenses the right to use fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms from five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those agreements, customers are
provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the expected length of the
agreements, including probable renewal periods. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $565 million and $488 million and were recognized as deferred
revenue, with $482 million and $402 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Minimum future licensing revenues expected to be recognized by Quanta pursuant to these agreements at December31, 2014 were
as follows in thousands:   Year Ending December 31 2015 90,549 2016 74,933 2017 62,348 2018 48,950 2019 32,775 Thereafter 124,739 
Fixed non-cancelable minimum licensing revenues 434,294 
Income Taxes 
Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or
liabilities are recovered or settled. Quanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which
future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these estimates, Quanta may not
realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated. Quanta records reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions in those
instances where Quanta considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain positions, Quanta assumes that
taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Quanta continually reviews exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. To the
extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and are classified in the provision for income taxes. 
As of December31, 2014, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions was $511 million, an increase
from December31, 2013 of $22 million. This increase in unrecognized tax benefits resulted from a $92 million increase due to tax positions expected to be taken for 2014 and a $24 million increase due to tax positions taken in prior years,
partially offset by a $94 million decrease due to the 
100 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
expiration of certain statute of limitations periods associated with the 2010 tax year. Quanta is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service IRS for calendar years 2011 and
2012 and remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2013 through 2014 as these statute of limitations periods have not yet expired. Additionally, certain subsidiaries are under examination by various U.S. state, Canadian and other foreign
tax authorities for multiple periods. Quanta believes it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $103 million as a result of settlement of these examinations or as a result of the
expiration of certain statute of limitations periods. The income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As
such, Quanta is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations and comprehensive income.
Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted earnings per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalents would be
antidilutive. Self-Insurance 
Quanta is insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims. Under these programs,
the deductibles for general liability and auto liability were $100 million per occurrence, the deductible for workers compensation was $50 million per occurrence, and the deductible for employers liability was $10 million per
occurrence for the 2014-2015 and the 2013-2014 policy years. For the 2012-2013 policy year, deductibles for general liability, auto liability and workers compensation were $50 million per occurrence, and the deductible for employers
liability was $10 million per occurrence. Quanta is generally self-insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible. Quanta also has employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective
bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $375,000 per claimant per year. Losses under all of these
insurance programs are accrued based upon Quantas estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult
to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of Quantas liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based
upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. Collective Bargaining Agreements
Some of Quantas operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain
of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The agreements require the operating units to pay specified
wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quantas multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the
collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
employee payrolls. The location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing
at that time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects. Therefore, Quanta is unable to accurately predict the union employee payroll and the amount of the resulting multi-employer pension plan contribution obligation for
future periods. Stock-Based Compensation 
Quanta recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock, restricted stock units RSUs and performance units to be settled in common stock
based on the fair value of the awards granted at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of restricted stock awards, RSUs and performance units to be settled in common stock is determined based on the number of shares or RSUs
or performance units granted and the closing price of Quantas common stock on the date of grant. An estimate of future forfeitures is required in determining the period expense. Quanta uses historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate;
however, these estimates are subject to change and may impact the value that will ultimately be realized as compensation expense. The resulting compensation expense from discretionary awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period, which is generally the vesting period, while compensation expense from performance-based awards is recognized using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Restricted stock awards, RSUs and performance units to
be settled in common stock are subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting. During the restriction period, holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such shares. The cash
flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for restricted stock, RSUs and performance units to be settled in common stock and stock options excess tax benefit are classified as financing cash flows.
Compensation expense associated with liability based awards, such as RSUs that are expected to be settled in cash, is recognized based on
a remeasurement of the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting period. RSUs to be settled in cash are intended to provide the holders with cash performance incentives that are substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity
ownership in Quanta. RSUs to be settled in cash typically vest in equal installments over a two-year or three-year period following the date of grant and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon
vesting of RSUs to be settled in cash, the holders receive for each vested RSU an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the vesting date of one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in the applicable award agreement. 
Functional Currency and Translation of Financial Statements 
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of Quantas operations, which are primarily located within the United States.
The functional currency for Quantas foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada and Australia, is typically the currency of the country in which the foreign operating unit is located. Generally, the currency in which the
operating unit transacts the majority of its activities, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency. The treatment of foreign currency translation gains or losses is dependent upon
managements determination of the functional currency of each operating unit, which involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the operating unit. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Quanta
translates the financial statements of its foreign operating units from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. Statements of operations, comprehensive income loss and cash flows are translated at average monthly rates, while balance sheets
are translated at month-end exchange rates. This results in translation gains or losses, which are included as a separate component of equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Gains and losses arising from
transactions which are not denominated in the operating units functional currencies are included within other income expense in the statements of operations. 
102 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Derivatives 
From time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts that qualify as derivatives in order to hedge the risks associated with
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain
transactions may not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting. For a hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy stated, along with
an explicit description of the methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness. The dates or periods for the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure must also
be documented. At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge must be deemed to be highly effective at minimizing the risk of the identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or losses of the derivative
to changes in the cash flows associated with the hedged item, and the forecasted transaction must be probable of occurring. For forward
contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta accounts for the change in fair value of the forward contracts directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Any ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized
in earnings in the period in which ineffectiveness occurs. For instance, if a forward contract is discontinued as a cash flow hedge because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified
time period, the related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss would be reclassified to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such determination is made. When a forecasted transaction
occurs, the portion of the accumulated gain or loss applicable to the forecasted transaction is reclassified from equity to earnings. Changes in fair value related to transactions that do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are
recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and are included in other income expense. Comprehensive Income 
Components of comprehensive income include all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from changes in Quantas capital
related accounts. Quanta records other comprehensive income loss, net of tax, for foreign currency translation adjustments related to its foreign operations and for other revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in comprehensive
income but excluded from net income. Litigation Costs and Reserves 
Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Costs
incurred for litigation are expensed as incurred. Further details are presented in Note15. Fair Value Measurements
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to
the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of variable rate debt also approximates fair value. For disclosure purposes, qualifying assets and liabilities are categorized into three broad levels based on the priority of the inputs
used to determine their fair values. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3. All of
Quantas cash equivalents were categorized as Level 1 assets at December31, 2014 and 2013, as all values were based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that Quanta has the ability to access. 
103 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In connection with Quantas acquisitions, identifiable intangible assets acquired
include goodwill, backlog, customer relationships, trade names, covenants not-to-compete, patented rights and developed technology. Quanta utilizes the fair value premise as the primary basis for its valuation procedures, which is a market-based
approach to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Quanta periodically engages the services of an independent valuation firm when a new
business is acquired to assist management with this valuation process, including assistance with the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the development of market-based valuation assumptions. Based on these considerations,
management utilizes various valuation methods, including an income approach, a market approach and a cost approach, to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired based on the appropriateness of each method in relation to the type of
asset being valued. The assumptions used in these valuation methods are analyzed and compared, where possible, to available market data, such as industry-based weighted average costs of capital and discount rates, trade name royalty rates, public
company valuation multiples and recent market acquisition multiples. The level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level Level 3. Quanta believes that these valuation methods appropriately represent the methods that
would be used by other market participants in determining fair value. Quanta uses fair value measurements on a routine basis in its
assessment of assets classified as goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used. In accordance with its annual impairment test during the quarter ended December31, 2014, the carrying amounts of such assets, including
goodwill, were compared to their fair values. The inputs used for fair value measurements for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used are the lowest level Level 3 inputs, and Quanta uses the assistance of third party
specialists to develop valuation assumptions. Quanta also uses fair value measurements in connection with the valuation of its
investments in private company equity interests and financing instruments. These valuations require significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets.
Typically, the initial costs of these investments are considered to represent fair market value, as such amounts are negotiated between willing market participants. On a quarterly basis, Quanta performs an evaluation of its investments to determine
if an other-than-temporary decline in the value of each investment has occurred and whether the recorded amount of each investment will be realizable. If an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment occurs, a fair value analysis
would be performed to determine the degree to which the investment was impaired and a corresponding charge to earnings would be recorded during the period. These types of fair market value assessments are similar to other nonrecurring fair value
measures used by Quanta, which include the use of significant judgment and available relevant market data. Such market data may include observations of the valuation of comparable companies, risk adjusted discount rates and an evaluation of the
expected performance of the underlying portfolio asset, including historical and projected levels of profitability or cash flows. In addition, a variety of additional factors may be reviewed by management, including, but not limited to,
contemporaneous financing and sales transactions with third parties, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment.  3.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: 
Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements 
On January1, 2014, Quanta adopted an update that provides guidance on the balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when
a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward exists as of the reporting date. The update is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2013.
The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on Quantas consolidated financial statements. 
104 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
In April 2014, the FASB issued an update that changes the requirement for reporting discontinued operations. A disposal of a component of an
entity or a group of components of an entity will be required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entitys operations and financial results when the
entity or group of components of an entity meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale or when it is disposed of by sale or other than by sale. The update also requires additional disclosures about discontinued operations, a disposal of an
individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements, and an entitys significant continuing involvement with a discontinued operation. The update is
effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2014, including interim periods within that year. Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been reported
in previously issued financial statements. Quanta adopted this guidance effective January1, 2015. This guidance will impact the disclosure and presentation of how Quanta reports any future disposals of components or groups of components of its
business. In May 2014, the FASB issued an update that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance as well as some cost
recognition guidance. The update requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. This update also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments,
information about contract balances and performance obligations, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. For public entities, the update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2016,
including interim periods within that year. The guidance can be applied on a full retrospective or modified retrospective basis whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of initially applying this update at the date of initial application, and
early adoption is not permitted. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements and is planning to adopt this guidance effective January1, 2017. 
In August2014, the FASB issued guidance to address the diversity in practice in determining when there is substantial doubt about an
entitys ability to continue as a going concern and when and how an entity must disclose certain relevant conditions and events.This update requires an entity to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the
aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued.If such conditions or events
exist, an entity should disclose that there is substantial doubt about the entitys ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued, along with
the principal conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, managements evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in relation to the entitys ability to meet its obligations and managements plans that are
intended to mitigate those conditions or events. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods ending after December15, 2016. This guidance will impact the disclosure and presentation of how Quanta reports any substantial doubt
about its ability to continue as a going concern, if such substantial doubt were to exist. Quanta will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2017. 
In February 2015, the FASB issued an update which amends existing consolidation guidance, including amending the guidance related to
determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity. The update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, although early adoption is permitted. The guidance may be applied using a modified retrospective
approach whereby the entity records a cumulative effect of adoption at the beginning of the fiscal year of initial application. A reporting entity may also

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis. Quanta is currently evaluating the potential impact of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 4.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS: 
On December3, 2012, Quanta sold substantially all of its domestic telecommunications infrastructure services
operations and related subsidiaries for net proceeds of approximately $2650 million. Quanta recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $180 million and a corresponding tax expense of approximately $322 million, which resulted in a loss on the
sale, net of tax, of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Quanta has presented the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of such telecommunications subsidiaries as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. The results of operations of these telecommunications subsidiaries were previously included primarily in the Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment. 
Summarized financial information for discontinued operations is shown below in thousands: Year EndedDecember31,2014 Year EndedDecember31,2013 Year EndedDecember31,2012 Revenues 493,233 Income loss from discontinued operations before taxes 1,014 46,576 Gain on disposal of discontinued operations before taxes 17,962 Provision benefit for income taxes 387 47,603 
Income loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes 627 16,935 
In connection with the sale of the telecommunications operations, Quanta remained liable for all income
related taxes and insured claims against the subsidiaries outstanding or arising as of December3, 2012. Additionally, Quanta accelerated the vesting of unvested shares of restricted stock held by certain employees of the disposed
telecommunications subsidiaries on December3, 2012, the closing date of the sale. Accordingly, Quanta recorded incremental expense related to this accelerated vesting of $37 million during the fourth quarter of 2012. This incremental expense
is included in income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2012. 
During the year ended December31, 2014, legal fees of $10 million were accrued related to an ongoing legal matter. See Legal
Proceedings Lorenzo Benton v. Telecom Network Specialists, Inc., et al. in Note 15 for additional information.  5.
ACQUISITIONS: 
2014 Acquisitions 
During 2014, Quanta completed nine acquisitions, which enabled Quanta to further enhance its electric power and oil and gas infrastructure
service offerings in the United States and Canada and expand its capabilities in Australia to include electric power infrastructure service offerings. These acquisitions included four electric power infrastructure services companies located in
Canada; two oil and gas infrastructure services businesses located in Canada; an electric power infrastructure services company located in Australia; a U.S. based general engineering and construction company specializing in hydrant fueling,
waterfront and utility construction for the U.S. Department of Defense that is generally included in Quantas Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services segment; 
106 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
and a geotechnical and geological engineering services company based in the United States that is generally included in Quantas Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. The aggregate
consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $2843 million in cash, 686,382 shares of Quanta common stock and 3,825,971 exchangeable shares of Canadian subsidiaries of Quanta that are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for
Quanta common stock. The exchangeable shares provide holders with rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends and other economic rights. In addition, Quanta issued one share of Series G preferred stock associated with
899,858 of the exchangeable shares, which generally votes on the same matters as Quanta common stock and is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of such exchangeable shares outstanding at that time. The exchangeable shares not
associated with preferred stock do not have voting rights. The aggregate value of the securities issued related to 2014 acquisitions on the respective closing or settlement dates of the acquisitions, totaled approximately $1345 million. As these
transactions were effective during 2014, the results of each acquired company have been included in Quantas consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. 
Quanta is in the process of finalizing its assessments of the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities related to the third and
fourth quarter 2014 acquisitions, and further adjustments to the purchase price allocations may occur. Quanta expects to complete the purchase accounting process as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the respective acquisition
dates. The aggregate purchase consideration related to the third and fourth quarter 2014 acquisitions was preliminarily allocated to acquired assets and assumed liabilities, which resulted in a preliminary allocation of approximately $1069 million
of net tangible assets, $1161 million of goodwill and $739 million of other intangible assets. 2013 Acquisitions 
During 2013, Quanta acquired six businesses, which enabled Quanta to further enhance its electric power infrastructure and oil and gas
infrastructure service offerings in the United States, Canada and Australia. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $3411 million in cash and 3,547,482 shares of Quanta common stock valued, as of the
respective dates of issuance, at approximately $889 million. The results for each company have been included in Quantas consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. 
2012 Acquisitions 
During 2012, Quanta acquired four businesses, which enabled Quanta to expand its electric power infrastructure services in Canada and its
electric power infrastructure services and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in the U.S. The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions consisted of approximately $575 million in cash, 1,927,113shares of Quanta common stock
valued at approximately $373 million, as of the respective dates of acquisition, and the repayment of $110 million in debt. The results for each company have been included in Quantas consolidated financial statements beginning on the
respective dates of acquisition.

The fair value of current assets acquired in 2014 included accounts receivable with a fair value of $1170
million. The fair value of current assets acquired in 2013 included accounts receivable with a fair value of $839 million. Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The 2014, 2013 and 2012 acquisitions strategically expanded Quantas Canadian, Australian and domestic
electric power and oil and gas service offerings, which Quanta believes contributes to the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with the 2014 acquisitions, goodwill of $715 million was recorded for reporting units included within
Quantas Electric Power Division and $1030 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas Oil and Gas Infrastructure Division on the dates of acquisition. In connection with the 2013 acquisitions, goodwill of $1125
million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas Electric Power Division and $1433 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas Oil and Gas Infrastructure Division on the dates of acquisition. In
connection with the 2012 acquisitions, goodwill of $575 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas Electric Power Division and $73 million was recorded for the reporting unit included within Quantas Oil and Gas
Infrastructure Division on the dates of acquisition. Goodwill of approximately $301 million and $2136 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes related to the businesses acquired in 2014 and 2013.

PER SHARE INFORMATION: 
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, and
diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalent
would be antidilutive. The amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 are illustrated below in thousands: Year Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Amounts Attributable to Common Stock Net income from continuing operations 297,341 401,921 289,694 Net income loss from discontinued operations 627 16,935

Credit Facility 
On October30, 2013, Quanta entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a $1325 billion
senior secured revolving credit facility maturing October30, 2018. The entire amount available may be used for revolving loans and letters of credit in U.S. dollars. Up to $4000 million may be used for revolving loans and letters of credit in
certain currencies other than U.S. dollars. Swing line loans are limited to $500 million in U.S. dollars, $300 million in Canadian dollars and $200 million in Australian dollars. In addition, subject to the conditions specified in the credit
agreement, Quanta has the option to increase the revolving commitments by up to $3000 million from time to time upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to be used to refinance
existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. As of December31, 2014,
Quanta had approximately $3367 million of outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, $2251 million of which was denominated in U.S. dollars and $1116 million of which was denominated in Australian or Canadian dollars, and $688 million of
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility, all of which was denominated in Canadian dollars. The remaining $9195 million was available for borrowings or issuing new letters of credit or bank guarantees. Information on borrowings under

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $152
million, $156 million and $93 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to foreign net operating loss carryforwards, state net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The net change in the total valuation
allowance for each of the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was a decrease of $04 million, an increase of $63 million and an increase of $05 million, respectively. The valuation allowance was established primarily as a result of
uncertainty in Quantas outlook as to future taxable income in particular tax jurisdictions. Quanta believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances. 
118 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
At December31, 2014, Quanta had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, the
tax effect of which was approximately $253 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows: 2015, $01 million; 2016, $00 million; 2017, $07 million; 2018, $01 million; 2019, $00 million and $244 million thereafter. A valuation allowance
of $139 million has been recorded against certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards. Through December31, 2014,
Quanta has not provided U.S.income taxes on approximately $3445 million of unremitted foreign earnings. If we were to repatriate cash that is indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., we could be subject to additional U.S income and foreign
withholding taxes. Because of the number and variability of assumptions required, it is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional U.S.tax liability that may result if Quanta decides to no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign
earnings outside the U.S. If Quantas intentions or U.S. tax laws change in the future, there may be a significant negative impact on the provision for income taxes and cash flows as a result of recording an incremental tax liability, in the
period such change occurs.

Balance at end of year 51,079 48,838 51,244 
For the year ended December31, 2014, the $94 million reduction was primarily due to the expiration of
certain federal and state statute of limitations periods for the 2010 tax year. For the year ended December31, 2013, the $115 million reduction was primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statute of limitations periods
for the 2009 tax year. For the year ended December31, 2012, the $120 million reduction was primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statute of limitations periods for the 2008 tax year.

Quanta classifies interest and penalties within the provision for income taxes. Quanta
recognized interest expense of $05 million, interest income of $03 million and interest income of $11 million in the provision for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
Quanta is currently under examination by the IRS for calendar years 2011 and 2012 and remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years
2013 through 2014 as these statute of limitations periods have not yet expired. Additionally, certain subsidiaries are under examination by various U.S. state, Canadian and other foreign tax authorities for multiple periods. Quantas Canadian
subsidiaries remain open to examination by the Canada Revenue Agency for tax years 2010 through 2014 as these statute of limitations periods have not yet expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does business to be a major tax
jurisdiction.  11.
EQUITY: 
Exchangeable Shares and Series F and Series G Preferred Stock 
In connection with certain Canadian acquisitions, the former owners of the acquired companies received exchangeable shares of certain Canadian
subsidiaries of Quanta, which may be exchanged at the option of the holders for Quanta common stock on a one-for-one basis. The holders of exchangeable shares can make an exchange only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange a minimum of
either 50,000 shares or, if less, the total number of remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the holder making the request. Additionally, in connection with two of such acquisitions, Quanta issued one share of Quanta SeriesF
preferred stock and one share of Quanta Series G preferred stock the Preferred Stock to voting trusts on behalf of the respective holders of the exchangeable shares issued in such acquisitions. Each share of Preferred Stock provides the holders of
such exchangeable shares voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at that time. 
The combination of the exchangeable shares and Preferred Stock gives the holders of such exchangeable shares rights equivalent to Quanta
common stockholders with respect to voting, dividends and other economic rights. The holders of exchangeable shares not associated with the Preferred Stock have rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends and other
economic rights but do not have voting rights. On March26, 2013, 409,110 exchangeable shares associated with the Preferred Stock were exchanged for Quanta common stock. As of December31, 2014, both shares of the Preferred Stock remained
outstanding and 7,325,971 exchangeable shares remained outstanding, of which 4,399,858 were associated with the Preferred Stock. 
Treasury Stock 
Under the stock incentive plans described in Note12, the tax withholding obligations of employees upon vesting of restricted stock awards
and RSUs settled in common stock are typically satisfied by Quanta making such tax payments and withholding a number of vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to the tax withholding obligation. For the settlement of these employee
tax liabilities, Quanta withheld 352,558shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December31, 2014, with a total market value of $123 million, 379,566shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December31,
2013 with a total market value of $121 million, and 370,007shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December31, 2012 with a total market value of $67 million. These shares and the related costs to acquire them were accounted
for as adjustments to the balance of treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate law, treasury stock is not counted for quorum purposes or entitled to vote. 
During the fourth quarter of 2013, Quantas board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to purchase, from
time to time through December31, 2016, up to $5000 million of its 
120 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
outstanding common stock. During the year ended December31, 2013, Quanta did not purchase any of its common stock under this program. During the year ended December31, 2014, Quanta
purchased approximately 30million shares of its common stock under this program at a cost of $935 million. The shares and the related cost to acquire them have been accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock. 
Non-controlling Interests 
Quanta holds investments in several joint ventures that provide infrastructure services under specific customer contracts. Typically, each
joint venture is owned equally by its members. Quanta has determined that certain of these joint ventures are variable interest entities, with Quanta providing the majority of the infrastructure services to the joint venture, which management
believes most significantly influences the economic performance of the joint venture. Management has concluded that Quanta is the primary beneficiary of each of these joint ventures and has accounted for each on a consolidated basis. The other
parties equity interests in these joint ventures have been accounted for as non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Income attributable to the other joint venture members in the amounts of $184 million, $194
million and $160 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, has been accounted for as a reduction of net income in deriving net income attributable to common stock. Equity in the consolidated assets and
liabilities of these joint ventures that is attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as non-controlling interests within total equity in the accompanying balance sheets. 
The carrying value of the investments held by Quanta in all of its variable interest entities was approximately $111 million and $71 million
at December31, 2014 and 2013. The carrying value of investments held by the non-controlling interests in these variable interest entities at December31, 2014 and 2013 was $111 million and $71 million. During the years ended
December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, distributions to non-controlling interests were $144 million, $176 million and $180 million. There were no other changes in equity as a result of transfers to/from the non-controlling interests during the
years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. See Note 15 for further disclosures related to Quantas joint venture arrangements.  12.
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION: 
Stock Incentive Plans 
On May19, 2011, Quantas stockholders approved the 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan provides for
the award of non-qualified stock options, incentive qualified stock options ISOs, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, stock bonus awards, performance compensation awards including performance units and cash bonus awards or any
combination of the foregoing. The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to provide participants with additional performance incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. Employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta or its
affiliates are eligible to participate in the 2011 Plan, as are prospective employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta who have agreed to serve Quanta in those capacities. An aggregate of 11,750,000 shares of Quanta common
stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Plan. Additionally, pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock
Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan, which was adopted on May24, 2007, Quanta may award restricted stock, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options to eligible employees, directors, and certain consultants and advisors. An aggregate
of 4,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Quanta also has a Restricted Stock Unit Plan the RSU Plan, pursuant to which RSUs may be awarded to certain employees and consultants of
Quantas Canadian operations. The 2011 Plan, the 2007 Plan and the RSU Plan, together with certain plans assumed by Quanta in
acquisitions, are referred to as the Plans.

The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Quanta.
The Compensation Committee has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the Plans, the authority to grant awards under the Plans, to construe and interpret the Plans and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions
necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plans. The Board also delegated to the Equity Grant Committee, a committee of the Board consisting of one or more directors, the authority to grant limited awards to eligible persons who are not
executive officers or non-employee directors. Restricted Stock and RSUs to be Settled in Common Stock 
During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, Quanta granted 14million, 15million and 13million shares of
restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock under the Plans with weighted average grant date fair values of $3509, $2937 and $2184 per share, respectively. The grant date fair value for awards of restricted stock and RSUs to be
settled in common stock is based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant. Restricted stock and RSU awards to be settled in common stock are subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until
vesting, which generally occurs in equal installments over a two-year or three-year period following the date of grant. During the restriction period, holders of restricted stock are entitled to vote and receive dividends on such shares. 
During the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, vesting activity consisted of 11million, 12million and
09million shares of restricted stock and RSUs settled in common stock with an approximate fair value at the time of vesting of $335 million, $328 million and $223 million, respectively. Vesting activity during the year ended
December31, 2013 included compensation cost of approximately $43 million associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and RSUs settled in common stock held by the former Executive Chairman of Quantas board of directors
upon his retirement in May 2013. A summary of the activity for restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock for the year ended
December31, 2014 is as follows shares in thousands:  Shares WeightedAverageGrantDateFair ValuePer share Unvested at January 1, 2014 2,358 2596 Granted 1,432 3509 Vested 1,138 3493 Forfeited 111 2958 
Unvested at December 31, 2014 2,541 3125 
As of December31, 2014, there was approximately $345 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested restricted stock and RSUs to be settled in common stock granted to both employees and non-employees. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 156 years. 
Performance Units to be Settled in Common Stock 
Performance units awarded pursuant to the Plans provide for the issuance of shares of common stock upon vesting. These performance units
cliff-vest at the end of a three-year performance period based on achievement of three-year financial targets and strategic goals on a 0% to 200% performance scale as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
122 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
During the year ended December31, 2014, Quanta granted 01million performance
units to be settled in common stock under the Plans with a weighted average grant date fair value of $3520 per share. No performance units were granted under the Plans during the years ended December31, 2013 or 2012.The grant date fair
value for awards of performance units to be settled in common stock is based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant applied to the total number of shares that Quanta anticipates will fully vest.This fair value is
expensed ratably over the vesting term.During the year ended December31, 2014, Quanta recognized $24 million in compensation expense associated with performance units to be settled in common stock.No performance units vested, and
no shares of common stock were distributed in connection with performance units during the year ended December31, 2014, as applicable performance periods had not yet concluded. 
RSUs to be Settled in Cash 
Certain RSUs granted by Quanta under the Plans are intended to provide plan participants with cash performance incentives that are
substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity ownership in Quanta. These RSUs to be settled in cash typically vest in equal installments over a two-year or three-year period following the date of grant and are subject to forfeiture
under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon vesting of these RSUs, the holders receive for each vested RSU an amount in cash equal to the fair market value on the vesting date of one share of Quanta common stock, as specified in
the applicable award agreement. Compensation expense related to RSUs to be settled in cash was $39 million, $31 million and $20
million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Such expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. RSUs that may be settled only in cash are not included in the calculation of earnings per share, and the
estimated earned value of such RSUs is classified as a liability. Quanta paid $31 million, $18 million and $17 million to settle liabilities related to cash-settled RSUs in the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Accrued liabilities for the estimated earned value of outstanding RSUs to be settled in cash were $29 million and $21 million at December31, 2014 and 2013.  13.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: 
Unions Multi-Employer Pension Plans 
Quanta contributes to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements with various
unions that represent certain of Quantas employees. Quantas multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and contributions are made to the
plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union employee payrolls. Quanta may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. The Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan
is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension
Plan Central States Plan following an amendment to the applicable collective bargaining agreement which eliminated their obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan. During the first quarter of 2014, Quanta recorded an adjustment to cost
of services to increase the recognized withdrawal liability. Additional information regarding this withdrawal, as well as the withdrawal from the Central States Plan of a company acquired by Quanta in the fourth quarter of 2013, is provided in
Collective Bargaining Agreements in Note 15.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 PPA also added special funding and operational rules
generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status based on multiple factors including, for example, the
plans funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or
rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or
may contribute in the future are in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be
estimated due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans.

The following table summarizes plan information relating to Quantas participation in
multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the status under the PPA of the plans and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan or contribution
surcharges. The most recent PPA zone status available in 2014 and 2013 relates to the plans fiscal year-end in 2013 and 2012. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2014. The PPA zone status is based on information that
Quanta received from the respective plans, as well as publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website, and is certified by the plans actuary. Although multiple factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone
status, plans in the red zone generally are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans are
classified as critical status, yellow zone plans are classified as endangered status and green zone plans are classified as neither endangered nor critical status. The Subject to Financial
Improvement/ Rehabilitation Plan column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan FIP or a rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of Quantas
collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject. Total contributions to these plans correspond to the number of union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and varies depending upon the location
and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources in connection with such projects. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans and in the aggregate for all other plans.  Fund  PlanNumber

In addition to the contributions made to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans noted above, Quanta also
contributed to multi-employer defined contribution or other benefit plans on behalf of certain union employees. Contributions to union multi-employer defined contribution or other benefit plans by Quanta were approximately $1290 million, $1044
million and $870 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. Total contributions made to these plans for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 correspond to the number of union employees employed at any given
time and the plans in which they participate and varies depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources in connection with such projects. 
Quanta 401k Plan 
Quanta maintains a 401k plan pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining agreement
may make contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each employees contribution up to 3% of that employees salary and 50% of each employees contribution between 3% and 6% of such
employees salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Contributions to non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were approximately $143 million, $118 million and $110 million for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan 
Quanta maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan pursuant to which non-employee directors and certain key employees, independent
contractors and consultants may defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation and/or settlement of their equity-based awards, subject to certain limitations.The plan provides for employer matching contributions for certain officers
and employees whose benefits under the 401k plan are limited by federal tax law.Quanta may also make discretionary employer contributions to the plan.Matching contributions and discretionary employer contributions are subject to a
vesting schedule, provided that vesting accelerates upon a change in control and the participants death or retirement.All matching and discretionary employer contributions, whether vested or not, are forfeited upon a participants
termination of employment for cause or upon the participant engaging in competition with Quanta or any of its affiliates. Contributions
to the deferred compensation plan by Quanta were approximately $03 million during the year ended December31, 2014. There were no contributions to the plan during the years ended December31, 2013 or 2012. At December31, 2014, $23
million was included in other long-term liabilities and $20 million was included in other long-term assets related to obligations under this plan and related company-owned life

insurance policies. Individuals participating in this plan receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout schedules or other events, as defined by the plan and
are also able to direct investments made on their behalf among investment alternatives permitted from time to time under the plan.  14.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: 
Certain of Quantas operating units have entered into related party lease arrangements for operational facilities,
typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease agreements generally have terms of up to five years and include renewal options. Related party lease expense for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was
approximately $87 million, $46 million and $42 million, respectively.  15.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
As described in Note11, Quanta holds investments in certain joint ventures with third parties for the purpose of providing infrastructure
services under certain customer contracts. Losses incurred by these joint ventures are generally shared equally by the joint venture members. However, each member of the joint venture typically is jointly and severally liable for all of the
obligations of the joint venture under the contract with the customer and therefore can be liable for full performance of the contract with the customer. In circumstances where Quantas participation in a joint venture qualifies as a general
partnership, the joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture including obligations owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead
to future claims against it for material amounts in connection with these joint and several liabilities. In the joint venture
arrangements entered into by Quanta, typically each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. It is
possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or perform obligations in excess of its share if the other joint venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead
to future claims against it for material amounts that would not be indemnified. During the fourth quarter of 2014, a limited partnership
in which Quanta is a partner, was selected for an engineering, procurement and construction EPC electric transmission project to construct a 500 kV transmission project consisting of approximately 500 kilometers of transmission line and two 500 kV
substations. Additionally, Quanta will provide turnkey EPC services for the entire project. As of December31, 2014, Quanta had outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates related to this project as

Additionally, as of December31, 2014, Quanta had outstanding capital commitments
associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates related to planned midstream infrastructure projects of approximately $101 million. Except for $08 million which was paid in the first quarter of 2015, Quanta is unable to determine the
exact timing of these capital commitments but anticipates them to be paid by June1, 2017. Leases 
Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases as discussed in
Note14. The terms of these agreements vary from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future minimum lease payments under these leases as of December31, 2014 in
thousands:  OperatingLeases Year Ending December 31 2015 79,441 2016 49,455 2017 39,462 2018 29,043 2019 14,716 Thereafter 23,470 
Total minimum lease payments 235,587 
Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately $1625 million, $1128 million and $923 million
for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Quanta has guaranteed the residual value on certain of its
equipment operating leases. Quanta has agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At December31, 2014, the maximum guaranteed residual
value was approximately $4342 million. Quanta believes that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no
assurance that significant payments will not be required in the future. Committed Capital Expenditures 
Quanta has committed capital for the expansion of its fiber optic network, although Quanta typically does not commit capital to new network
expansions until it has a committed licensing arrangement in place with at least one customer. The amounts of committed capital expenditures are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures
related to building the networks could vary materially from these estimates. As of December31, 2014, Quanta estimates these committed capital expenditures to be approximately $168 million for the year ended December31, 2015. Quanta also
committed capital for the expansion of its vehicle fleet in order to accommodate manufacturer lead times on certain types of vehicles. As of December31, 2014, production orders for approximately $56 million had been issued with delivery dates
expected to occur throughout 2015. Although Quanta has committed to purchase these vehicles at the time of their delivery, Quanta intends that these orders will be assigned to third party leasing companies and made available to Quanta under certain
of its master equipment lease agreements, thereby releasing Quanta from its capital commitments.

Legal Proceedings 
Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These
actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta discloses matters for which management
believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quantas consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature
of damages sought and the probability of success. Managements judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainties of litigation. 
Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration.On April21, 2010, PAR entered into a contract with SDGE to construct a 117-mile
electrical transmission line in Imperial and San Diego Counties, California, known as the Sunrise Powerlink project. Construction commenced on November 17, 2010, with commercial operations beginning on June 17, 2012. PAR alleged that during the
construction phase, SDGE directed multiple changes to the construction schedule that required us to significantly increase our resources to the project in order to meet SDGEs required completion date. Further, PAR contended that the
project experienced numerous impacts beyond our control such as access delays and restrictions, as well as problems with customer supplied materials to the project. Following completion of the project, PAR had multiple meetings with SDGE to
review project scope, costs and performance criteria in an attempt to resolve the amount owed to PAR. SDGE also conducted an audit of PARs records, which resulted in confirmation of PARs direct costs incurred in completing the
project, but not a resolution of the final amount owed to PAR. PAR previously recorded a long-term contract receivable in the amount of approximately $165 million in connection with contract price adjustments related to the Sunrise Powerlink
project. In October 2013, PAR initiated arbitration proceedings against SDGE alleging breach of contract and seeking compensation
for additional costs incurred at SDGEs direction to complete the project. SDGE filed a counterclaim for breach of contract seeking approximately $32 million for PARs alleged untimely performance. During the third quarter of
2014, Quanta evaluated the legal theories and strategies most advantageous to pursue relative to its position in the arbitration at the time, which resulted in a change in expected strategy for collecting the receivable. This change in approach
caused Quanta to revise its estimate of expected outcomes and to record an adjustment to the net realizable value of this long-term contract receivable. A provision of $525 million was recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2014 as a
charge to selling, general and administrative expense to reflect the impact of these changes in our assessment of the collectability of this long-term contract receivable. PAR subsequently amended its arbitration demand in October 2014 and asserted
a claim for damages in excess of $113 million including interest and other relief to which it was entitled.In December 2014, the parties reached an agreement to dismiss the arbitration.The settlement terms provided for a cash payment by
SDGE to PAR in the amount of $65 million, representing the final amount to compensate PAR for substantially all of the unpaid portion of PARs costs incurred on the project. As a result, an additional provision of $499 million was
recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2014 as a charge to selling, general and administrative expense to reflect the impact of this settlement.Payment was received in January 2015, and the arbitration was
dismissedshortlythereafter.

Lorenzo Benton v. Telecom Network Specialists, Inc., et al.In June 2006,
Plaintiff Lorenzo Benton filed a class action complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, alleging various wage and hour violations against Telecom Network Specialists TNS, a former subsidiary of
Quanta.Benton seeks to represent a class of workers that includes all persons who worked on TNS projects between June 2002 and the present, including individuals that TNS retained through 29 staffing agencies.An amended complaint was
filed in August 2007, naming two additional class representatives, one of whom has since settled directly with his employer.Plaintiffs motion for class certification was heard and denied in May 2012.Plaintiffs appealed the denial
of class certification, and in October 2013, the California Court of Appeal reversed the denial and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration.In November 2013, TNS filed a petition for review with the Supreme Court of
California, which was denied.The parties attended mediation in December 2014, however, there was no resolution. Accordingly, the deadline for Plaintiffs to file their motion for class certification in the remanded proceeding is March19,
2015. Plaintiffs seek approximately $16 million for class damages and $5 million in attorneys fees.Quanta retained any liability associated with this matter following its sale of TNS in December 2012. 
Additionally, in November 2007, TNS filed cross complaints for indemnity against the staffing agencies, which employed many of the individuals
in the putative class. In December 2012, the trial court heard cross-motions for summary judgment filed by TNS and the staffing agencies pertaining to TNSs demand for indemnity.The court denied TNSs motion and granted the motions
filed by the staffing agencies.TNS appealed the courts ruling.The appeal is fully briefed, but a date for oral argument has not been set. At this time, Quanta does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Arbitration. On
October1, 2010, Mears Group, Inc. Mears, a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta, filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce in London against the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago NGC. The request for
arbitration arose out of a contract between Mears and NGC for directional drilling services in connection with a shore approach of a natural gas pipeline. During pullback of the pipeline, a component on the drill rig operated by Mears failed, and
the pipeline was lodged downhole. Subsequent efforts to salvage the pipeline by NGC, Mears and other parties failed to dislodge the pipeline. NGC subsequently hired a separate contractor to complete reworks. 
Mears alleged breach of contract, among other things, and sought recovery for works performed, standby costs, demobilization costs, and other
expenses, totaling approximately $165 million, plus pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees and expenses. In addition, Mears argued that NGC failed to provide a contractually required builders all-risk insurance policy naming Mears as an
additional insured, which would have covered losses associated with a pullback failure. NGC counterclaimed in the arbitration, asserting that Mears breached the contract and performed negligently, and sought recovery for the costs of the salvage
operations, the cost of the reworks, as well as other costs, totaling approximately $795 million, plus pre-judgment interest and attorneys fees and expenses. 
The arbitration hearings were completed during the third quarter of 2012. On March20, 2014, the arbitration panel issued a decision
awarding NGC $173 million in damages plus interest and NGC attorneys fees of approximately $110 million. As a result, Mears was unsuccessful in recovering any amounts sought in its claim against NGC and wrote off approximately $105 million
of accounts receivable associated with the NGC contract, resulting in an aggregate $388 million charge to selling, general and administrative expenses in the three months ended March31, 2014 and in the year ended December31, 2014.
Quanta paid the $283 million in damages plus interest and NGC attorneys fees in April 2014.

SEC Notice.On March10, 2014, the SEC notified Quanta of an inquiry into
certain aspects of Quantas activities in certain foreign jurisdictions, including South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.The SEC also requested that Quanta take necessary steps to preserve and retain categories of relevant documents,
including those pertaining to Quantas U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance program.The SEC has not alleged any violations of law by Quanta or its employees.Quanta has complied with the preservation request and is
cooperating with the SEC. For additional information regarding other pending legal proceedings, see Collective Bargaining
Agreements in this Note 15. Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, including
amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of Quantas cash investments are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality financial
institutions. In accordance with Quantas investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to be high quality investments, which consist primarily of interest-bearing
demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is subject to any material risk
of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income Quanta receives from these investments. In addition, Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to its customers, which include electric
power, oil and gas companies, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States, Canada and Australia. Consequently, Quanta is subject to
potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States, Canada and Australia, which may be heightened as a result of uncertain economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent
years. However, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Historically, some of Quantas customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties
in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services Quanta has performed. 
As of December31, 2013, two customers accounted for approximately 15% and 11% of consolidated net position. The services provided to
these customers related primarily to Quantas Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment. Substantially all of the balance for the customer accounting for 11% of Quantas consolidated net position at December31, 2013 related to
the Sunrise Powerlink project, which had a long-term receivable balance related to a significant change order. This receivable was the subject of an arbitration proceeding that was dismissed in January 2015 pursuant to a December 2014 settlement
agreement. For additional information, see Current and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Revenue Recognition in Note 2 and Legal Proceedings Sunrise Powerlink Arbitration
within this Note 15. No other customers represented 10% or more of Quantas consolidated net position as of December31, 2013. No customers represented 10% or more of Quantas revenues for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013
and 2012 or 10% or more of Quantas consolidated net position as of December31, 2014. Self-Insurance 
As discussed in Note 2, Quanta is insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation
claims. As of December31, 2014 and 2013, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $1702 million and $1618 million, with $1308 million and $1226 million considered to be long-

term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December31, 2014 and 2013 were $91 million and $91 million, of which $08 million and
$07 million were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $83 million and $84 million were included in other assets, net. 
Letters of Credit 
Certain of Quantas vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its behalf, such as to
beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment to its subcontractors and vendors and to guarantee performance under its contracts.
Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, typically pursuant to Quantas credit facility. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if
the holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also be
required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future. 
As of December31, 2014, Quanta had $3367 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees under its credit facility to
secure its casualty insurance program and various contractual commitments. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2015. Upon maturity, it is expected that the majority of the
letters of credit related to the casualty insurance program will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods. Performance Bonds and
Parent Guarantees In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide performance bonds in connection with its contractual
commitments. Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these performance bonds. These performance bonds expire at various times ranging from mechanical completion of the related projects to a period extending beyond
contract completion in certain circumstances, and as such, a determination of maximum potential amounts outstanding requires the use of certain estimates and assumptions. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and
level of Quantas bonded operating activity. As of December31, 2014, the total amount of the outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately $28 billion. Quantas estimated maximum exposure as it relates to the value
of the bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each of its commitments under the performance bonds generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of its related contractual obligation. The
estimated cost to complete these bonded projects was approximately $701 million as of December31, 2014. Quanta, from time to time,
guarantees the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Quanta is
not aware of any material obligations for performance or payment asserted against it under any of these guarantees. Employment
Agreements Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide for compensation
and certain other benefits and for severance payments under certain circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that become effective upon a change of control of Quanta. Quanta may be obligated to pay certain amounts to such
employees upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the various employment agreements. 
132 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Collective Bargaining Agreements 
Some of Quantas operating units are parties to various collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain of their
employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. From time to time, Quanta is a party to grievance actions based on claims
arising out of the collective bargaining agreements. The agreements require the operating units to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee
benefit trusts. Quantas multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis
based on its union employee payrolls. The location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union
resources in connection with those projects. Therefore, Quanta is unable to accurately predict its union employee payroll and the amount of the resulting multi-employer pension plan contribution obligation for future periods. 
The PPA also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that
are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status based on multiple factors including, for example, the plans funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to
experience a minimum funding deficiency. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from
employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in endangered, seriously
endangered or critical status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated due to uncertainty of the future levels of work that require the
specific use of union employees covered by these plans, as well as the future contribution levels and possible surcharges on contributions applicable to these plans. 
Quanta may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension
plans. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the
employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a
contributing employers own retirees. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the reallocation of
liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its withdrawal liability. Other than as described below, Quanta is not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been incurred
as a result of a withdrawal by any of Quantas operating units from any multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. In the fourth
quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $326 million related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan the Central States Plan.
The partial withdrawal liability recognized by Quanta was based on estimates received from the Central States Plan during 2011 for a complete withdrawal by all Quanta companies participating in the Central States Plan. The withdrawal followed an
amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Teamsters that eliminated obligations to contribute to the Central States Plan, which is in critical status and is significantly underfunded as to its
vested benefit obligations. The amendment was negotiated by the Pipe Line Contractors Association PLCA on behalf of its members, which include the Quanta subsidiaries that withdrew from the Central States Plan. Quanta believed that
133 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
withdrawing from the Central States Plan in the fourth quarter of 2011 was advantageous because it limited Quantas exposure to increased liabilities from a future withdrawal if the
underfunded status of the Central States Plan deteriorates further. Quanta and other PLCA members now contribute to a different multi-employer pension plan on behalf of Teamsters employees. 
The Central States Plan asserted that the withdrawal of the PLCA members was not effective in 2011, although Quanta believed at that time that
a legally effective withdrawal had occurred during the fourth quarter of 2011. Although the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled that the withdrawal of the PLCA members was not effective in 2011, the
PLCA appealed the decision, and the outcome of that appeal remains uncertain. Certain other Quanta subsidiaries continued participation in the Central States Plan, and Quanta believes that it subsequently effected a complete withdrawal as of
December30, 2012. In December 2013, the Central States Plan filed separate lawsuits against two of Quantas subsidiaries. In
the first lawsuit, the Central States Plan alleged that a Quanta subsidiary elected to participate in the Central States Plan pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement under which it participates. The subsidiary argued that no such election
was made and that any payments made by the subsidiary to the Central States Plan were made in error. The parties recently reached an agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit, pursuant to which, among other things, the Central States Plan agreed
to return the payments made by the subsidiary. In the second lawsuit, the Central States Plan alleges that contributions made by another Quanta subsidiary to a new industry fund that was created after Quanta withdrew from the Central States Plan
should have been made to the Central States Plan. This arguably would extend the date of withdrawal for this subsidiary to 2014. Quanta has disputed these allegations on the basis that it has properly paid contributions to the new industry fund
based on the terms of the collective bargaining agreement under which it participates. In March 2014, one of the Quanta subsidiaries was
notified of a joint grievance committee decision relating to a separate grievance matter concluding that the Quanta subsidiary should have hired Teamsters under a specific collective bargaining agreement to perform certain jobs. This matter was
subsequently resolved with the Teamsters, effectively resulting in an award of wages and benefits including pension contributions to the two Teamsters employees under an alternate collective bargaining agreement that is not related to the Central
States Plan. In addition, in March 2014, the Central States Plan provided revised estimates indicating that the withdrawal liability based on certain withdrawal scenarios from 2011 through 2014 could range between $401 million and $554 million. In
July 2014, the Central States Plan provided Quanta with a Notice and Demand of partial withdrawal liability for certain Quanta entities in the amount of $396 million. Quanta continues to dispute the total withdrawal liability owed to the Central
States Plan. However, Quanta began to make monthly payments associated with this Notice and Demand in the third quarter of 2014 while the parties continue the related process to determine the final withdrawal liability. The amount owed upon
resolution of this matter will be reduced by these monthly payments made. The ultimate liability associated with the complete withdrawal
of Quantas subsidiaries from the Central States Plan will depend on various factors, including interpretations of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participated and whether exemptions from
withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. Based on the previous estimates of liability associated with a complete withdrawal from the Central States Plan, and allowing for the exclusion of amounts believed
by management to have been improperly included in such estimate, Quanta will seek to challenge and further negotiate the amount owed in connection with this matter. However, Quanta recorded an adjustment to cost of services during the three months
ended March31, 2014 to increase the recognized withdrawal liability to an amount within the range communicated to Quanta by the Central States Plan. Quanta believes that the range of reasonable possible loss associated with the Central States
Plan is up to $554 million. Given the unknown nature 
134 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of some of the factors mentioned above, the final withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that the amount owed upon final resolution
of these matters could be materially higher than the liability Quanta has recognized through December31, 2014. On October9,
2013, Quanta acquired a company that experienced a complete withdrawal from the Central States Plan prior to the date of acquisition. The Central States Plan issued a Notice and Demand dated March13, 2013 to the acquired company for a
withdrawal liability in the total amount of $69 million payable in installments. Based on legal arguments, the acquired company took the position that the amount of withdrawal liability payable to the Central States Plan as a result of its complete
withdrawal was $48 million, of which approximately $31 million remained outstanding as of December31, 2014. The acquired company and Quanta have taken steps to challenge the amount of the assessment by the Central States Plan; however,
payments in accordance with the terms of the Central States Plans demand letter are required to be made while the dispute is ongoing. Approximately $21 million of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account on October9, 2013
to fund any withdrawal obligation in excess of the $48 million initially demanded. Accordingly, the acquired companys withdrawal from the Central States Plan is not expected to have a material impact on Quantas financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. Indemnities 
Quanta generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts, as well as other specified liabilities, which may
subject Quanta to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. Quanta has also indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with Quantas previous acquisition
or disposition of certain companies. The indemnities under acquisition or disposition agreements are usually contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December31, 2014, except as otherwise set
forth above in Legal Proceedings, Quanta does not believe any material liabilities for claims exist against it in connection with any of these indemnity obligations. 
In the normal course of Quantas acquisition transactions, Quanta obtains rights to indemnification from the sellers or former owners of
acquired companies for certain risks, liabilities and obligations arising from their prior operations, such as performance, operational, safety, workforce or tax issues, some of which Quanta may not have discovered during due diligence. Quanta is in
the process of identifying certain pre-acquisition obligations associated with non-U.S. payroll taxes that may be due from a business acquired by Quanta in 2013. Quanta may seek recovery from the indemnity counterparties for any amounts that Quanta
may be required to pay in connection with such pre-acquisition matters. However, the indemnities may not cover all of Quantas exposure for such pre-acquisition matters, as the indemnities under acquisition agreements are usually contingent
upon Quanta incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds, and the indemnitors may be unwilling or unable to pay the amounts owed to Quanta.  16.
SEGMENT INFORMATION: 
Quanta presents its operations under three reportable segments: 1Electric Power Infrastructure Services,
2Oil and Gas Infrastructure Services and 3Fiber Optic Licensing and Other. This structure is generally based on the broad end-user markets for Quantas services. See Note 1 for additional information regarding Quantas
reportable segments. Quantas segment results are derived from the types of services provided across its operating units in each of
the end user markets described above. Quantas entrepreneurial business model allows each of its operating units to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services across end user markets. Quantas operating units
are organized into one of three internal divisions, namely, the Electric Power Division, the Oil 
135 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
and Gas Infrastructure Division and the Fiber Optic Licensing Division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable segments described above based on their operating
units predominant type of work. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is
gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of Quantas market strategies. These classifications of Quantas operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at
times require judgment on the part of management. Quantas operating units may perform joint infrastructure service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of network services under a single customer contract or
provide service across industries, for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric power and natural gas customers. 
In addition, Quantas integrated operations and common administrative support at each of its operating units require that certain
allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses, including depreciation, and general and administrative costs, be made to determine operating segment profitability. Corporate
costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible assets are not allocated. 
Summarized financial information for Quantas reportable segments is presented in the following table in thousands: Year Ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Revenues Electric Power Infrastructure 5,238,627 4,480,647 4,206,509 Oil and Gas Infrastructure 2,444,558 1,869,615 1,534,713 Fiber Optic Licensing and Other 168,065 172,580 179,047

Separate measures of Quantas assets and cash flows by reportable segment, including capital
expenditures, are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance. Quantas fixed assets, which are held at the operating unit level, include operating machinery, equipment and vehicles, as well as office equipment,
buildings and leasehold improvements, are used on an interchangeable basis across its reportable segments. As such, for reporting purposes, total depreciation expense is allocated each quarter among Quantas reportable segments based on the
ratio of each reportable segments revenue contribution to consolidated revenues.

Foreign Operations 
During 2014, 2013, and 2012, Quanta derived $189 billion, $131 billion and $8615 million, respectively, of its revenues from foreign
operations. Of Quantas foreign revenues, approximately 82%, 86% and 96% was earned in Canada during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, Quanta held property and equipment of $3729 million and
$1968 million in foreign countries, primarily Canada, as of December31, 2014 and 2013. The increases in foreign revenues and assets were partially due to the timing of the non-U.S. acquisitions described in Note 5. 17.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS: 
Acquisitions 
During the first quarter of 2015, Quanta has completed the acquisition of three companies. These acquisitions included an underground utility
distribution contractor that provides services to gas and electric utilities in Canada, a supplier and material procurement specialist for the power and utility industry in Canada and a company that specializes in the engineering, procurement,
construction, and commissioning of compression and surface facilities for the Australian high pressure gas industry. The aggregate consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $363 million in cash, subject to net working capital
adjustments. As these transactions were effective during the first quarter of 2015, the results will be included in Quantas consolidated financial statements beginning on the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions should enable
Quanta to further enhance its electric power and oil and gas infrastructure service offerings in Canada and Australia. Stock Repurchases
During the first quarter of 2015, Quanta repurchased approximately 67million shares of its common stock under its stock
repurchase program at a cost of $1820 million.
