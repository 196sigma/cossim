Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Included in our system of internal control are written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, the selection and training of qualified personnel and a program of financial and operations reviews by our professional staff of corporate auditors.Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the underlying transactions, including the acquisition and disposition of assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that our assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with managements and our directors authorization and are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our Financial Statements.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our evaluation was based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 1992 Framework COSO.Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2013. The conclusion of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer is based upon the recognition that there are inherent limitations in all systems of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein./s/ Philip K.

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONSOrganization and Nature of OperationsFounded in 1889, Chicago Bridge Iron Company N.V. CBI or the Company provides a wide range of services, including conceptual design, technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, modularization, construction, commissioning, maintenance, program management and environmental services to customers in the energy infrastructure market throughout the world, and is a provider of diversified government services. Our business is aligned into four principal operating groups: 1Engineering, Construction and Maintenance, 2Fabrication Services, 3Technology, and 4Government Solutions. Natural gas, petroleum, power and petrochemical projects for the worldwide energy and natural resource industries accounted for a majority of our revenue in 2013, 2012and 2011. See Note 18 for a description of our operating groups and related financial information2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Accounting and ConsolidationThese Consolidated Financial Statements Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP and include all wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities which we are required to consolidate, including those acquired as part of our acquisition of The Shaw Group, Inc. Shaw the Shaw Acquisition or the Acquisition, as further described in Note 4. See the Partnering Arrangements section of this footnote for further discussion of our consolidation policy for those entities that are not wholly-owned. Significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Inventory balances at December31, 2012have been reclassified from other current assets to conform to our December31, 2013presentation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the most significant estimates and judgments are associated with revenue recognition for our contracts, including the recognition of incentive fees and unapproved change orders and claims; determination of fair value with respect to acquired tangible and intangible net assets; recoverability assessments that must be periodically performed with respect to long-lived tangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation of deferred tax assets and financial instruments; the determination of liabilities related to self-insurance programs and income taxes; and consolidation determinations with respect to our partnering arrangements. If the underlying estimates and assumptions upon which our Financial Statements are based change in the future, actual amounts may differ from those included in the accompanying Financial Statements.Revenue RecognitionOur revenue is primarily derived from long-term contracts and is generally recognized using the percentage of completion POC method, primarily based on the percentage that actual costs-to-date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract. We follow the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Revenue Recognition Topic 605-35 for accounting policies relating to our use of the POC method, estimating costs, and revenue recognition, including the recognition of incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims, and combining and segmenting contracts. We primarily utilize the cost-to-cost approach to estimate POC as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. Under the cost-to-cost approach, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts. Significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor and subcontracts; labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontract and supplier progress; liquidated damages; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates. Our backlog generally consists of several hundred contracts, and although our results are impacted by changes in estimated project margins, in 2013 and for the past several years, such aggregate variations have not resulted in a material net impact to our income from operations. Individual projects with significant changes in estimated margins resulted in a net reduction to income from operations of approximately $15,000and $25,000for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our long-term contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis and the timing of revenue recognition may be impacted by the terms of such contracts. We use a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Fixed-price contracts, and hybrid contracts with a 51Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedmore significant fixed-price component, tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred, and accordingly, when revenue is recognized. Cost-reimbursable contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant cost-reimbursable component, generally provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work, and accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of revenue recognition. Contract revenue for our long-term contracts recognized under the POC method reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries for incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims. We recognize revenue associated with incentive fees when the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred, the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. Our recorded incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates. See Note 17 for additional discussion of our recorded unapproved change orders, claims, incentives and other contract recoveries.With respect to our engineering, procurement, and construction EPC services, our contracts are not segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, if each of the EPC components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire EPC contract. However, we segment an EPC contract if it includes technology or fabrication services and the technology or fabrication scope is independently negotiated and priced. In addition, an EPC contract including technology or fabrication services may be segmented if we satisfy the segmenting criteria in ASC 605-35. Revenue recorded in these situations is based on our prices and terms for similar services to third party customers. Segmenting a contract may result in different interim rates of profitability for each scope of service than if we had recognized revenue without segmenting. In some instances, we may combine contracts that are entered into in multiple phases, but are interdependent and include pricing considerations by us and the customer that are impacted by all phases of the project. Otherwise, if each phase is independent of the other and pricing considerations do not give effect to another phase, the contracts will not be combined.Cost of revenue for our long-term contracts includes direct contract costs, such as materials and labor, and indirect costs that are attributable to contract activity. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Cumulative costs and estimated earnings recognized to-date in excess of cumulative billings is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Balance Sheet as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Cumulative billings in excess of cumulative costs and estimated earnings recognized to-date is reported on the Balance Sheet as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. At December31, 2013and 2012, we had billings to customers on our long-term contracts of $16,113,591and $8,108,320, respectively, netted within costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and billings to customers of $25,436,810and $10,797,749, respectively, netted within billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Any uncollected billed revenue, including contract retentions, is reported as accounts receivable. At December31, 2013and 2012, accounts receivable included contract retentions of approximately $68,600and $37,200, respectively. Contract retentions due beyond one year were not significant at December31, 2013or 2012.Revenue for our service contracts that do not satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition under the POC method is recorded at the time services are performed. Revenue associated with incentive fees for these contracts is recognized when earned. Unbilled receivables for our service contracts are recorded within accounts receivable and were $79,979and $5,721at December31, 2013and 2012, respectively. Revenue for our pipe and steel fabrication and catalyst manufacturing contracts that are independent of an EPC contract, or for which we satisfy the segmentation criteria discussed above, is recognized upon shipment of the fabricated or manufactured units. During the fabrication or manufacturing process, all related direct and allocable indirect costs are capitalized as work in process inventory and such costs are recorded as cost of revenue at the time of shipment.Our billed and unbilled revenue may be exposed to potential credit risk if our customers should encounter financial difficulties, and we maintain reserves for specifically-identified potential uncollectible receivables. At December31, 2013and 2012, allowances for doubtful accounts were approximately $1,000and $1,300, respectively.Precontract CostsPrecontract costs are generally charged to cost of revenue as incurred, but, in certain cases their recognition may be deferred if specific probability criteria are met. We had no significant deferred precontract costs at December31, 2013or 2012.Research and DevelopmentExpenditures for research and development activities are charged to cost of revenue as incurred and were $27,071in 2013, $27,606in 2012and $27,548in 2011.Other Operating Expense Income, NetOther operating expense income, net, generally represents losses gains associated with the sale or disposition of property and equipment. 52Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedAcquisition and Integration Related CostsOur acquisition and integration related costs for 2013totaled $95,737, while acquisition-related costs for 2012totaled $11,000. Acquisition-related costs primarily included transaction costs, professional fees, and change-in-control and severance-related costs. Integration-related costs primarily related to facility consolidations and the associated accelerated lease costs for vacated facilities and personnel relocation costs.Depreciation ExpenseProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, including buildings and improvements 10to 40years and plant and field equipment 1to 15years. Renewals and betterments that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. Depreciation expense is primarily included within cost of revenue and was $118,915in 2013including $75,059associated with property and equipment acquired in the Shaw Acquisition, $43,808in 2012and $43,882in 2011. See Note 8 for disclosure of the components of property and equipment.Impairment of Long-Lived AssetsGoodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually at our reporting unit level, absent any indicators of impairment. Our Engineering, Construction and Maintenance operating group includes three reporting units, our Fabrication Services operating group includes two reporting units, and our Technology and Government Solutions operating groups each represent a reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of the beginning of that years fourth quarter. As part of our annual impairment assessment, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of our reporting units. We utilized an income approach discounted cash flow method to value our reporting units and test for impairment as we believe this is the most direct approach to incorporate the specific economic attributes and risk profiles of our reporting units into our valuation model. This is consistent with the methodology used for our annual impairment assessment in previous years. We generally do not utilize a market approach given the difficulty in identifying relevant market transactions and the volatility of markets from which transactions are derived. Based upon this quantitative assessment, no impairment charge was necessary during 2013, as the fair value of each of the reporting units acquired in 2013exceeded their respective net book value and the fair value of all other reporting units significantly exceeded their respective net book values. If, based on future assessments, our goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the impairment would result in a charge to earnings in the year of impairment.We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis with lives ranging from 2to 20years, absent any indicators of impairment. We review tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If a recoverability assessment is required, the estimated future cash flow associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if impairment exists. We noted no indicators of impairment in 2013or 2012. See Note 6 for further discussion regarding goodwill and other intangible assets.Earnings Per Share EPSBasic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to CBI by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities, consisting of restricted shares, performance shares where performance criteria have been met, stock options and directors deferred-fee shares. See Note 3 for calculations associated with basic and diluted EPS.Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents are considered to be all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less.InventoryInventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market and cost is determined using the first-in-first-out FIFO or weighted-average cost method. The cost of inventory includes acquisition costs, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred to bring the inventory to a current location and condition. An allowance for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, estimates of future sales expectations and salvage value. See Note 5 for additional disclosures associated with our inventory.Foreign CurrencyThe nature of our business activities involves the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations into our reporting currency are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income loss AOCI which is net of tax, where applicable. Foreign currency exchange gains losses are included within cost of revenue and were immaterial in 2013, 2012and 2011.Financial InstrumentsWe utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as described below:Foreign Currency Exchange Rate DerivativesWe do not engage in currency speculation; however, we do utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an on-going basis to hedge against certain foreign currency-related operating exposures. We generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures 53Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedand designate them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, gains and losses, exclusive of credit risk and forward points which represent the time-value component of the fair value of our derivative positions, are included in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. Changes in the fair value of 1 credit risk and forward points, 2 instruments deemed ineffective during the period, and 3 instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges are recognized within cost of revenue.Interest Rate DerivativesOn February 28, 2013, we entered into a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with $505,000of our $1,000,000unsecured term loan the Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through December31, 2013. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are included in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings.For those contracts designated as cash flow hedges, we document all relationships between the derivative instruments and associated hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific firm commitments or highly-probable forecasted transactions. We continually assess, at inception and on an on-going basis, the effectiveness of derivative instruments in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the designated hedged items. Hedge accounting designation is discontinued when 1it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item, including firm commitments or forecasted transactions, 2 the derivative is sold, terminated, exercised, or expires, 3it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, or 4we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. See Note 11 for additional discussion of our financial instruments.Income TaxesDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The final realization of deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions. We provide income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, in situations where we have and have not received tax assessments. Tax and associated interest reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide. We continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and, as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. See Note 16 for additional discussion of our income taxes. Partnering ArrangementsIn the ordinary course of business, we execute specific projects and conduct certain operations through joint venture, consortium and other collaborative arrangements collectively referred to as ventures. We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party customer; however, services may be performed directly by the ventures, or may be performed by us or our partners, or a combination thereof.Venture net assets consist primarily of cash, working capital and property and equipment, and assets may be restricted from being used to fund obligations outside of the venture. These ventures typically have limited third-party debt or have debt that is non-recourse in nature; however, they may provide for capital calls to fund operations or require participants in the venture to provide additional financial support, including advance payment or retention letters of credit.Each venture is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis as to whether it qualifies as a VIE under the consolidations guidance in ASC 810. A venture generally qualifies as a VIE when it 1 meets the definition of a legal entity, 2absorbs the operational risk of the projects being executed, creating a variable interest, and 3lacks sufficient capital investment from the partners, potentially resulting in the venture requiring additional subordinated financial support, if necessary, to finance its future activities.If at any time a venture qualifies as a VIE, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore, need to consolidate the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary if we have 1 the power to direct the economically significant activities of the VIE and 2 the right to receive benefits from, and obligation to absorb losses of, the VIE. If the venture is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, or we otherwise have the ability to control the venture, we consolidate the venture. If we are not determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, or only have the ability to significantly influence, rather than control the venture, we do not consolidate the venture. We account for unconsolidated ventures using the equity method or proportionate consolidation. At December31, 2013and 2012, we had no material proportionately consolidated ventures.

ACQUISITIONSShaw AcquisitionGeneralOn July30, 2012, we entered into a definitive agreement the Acquisition Agreement to acquire Shaw, whose operations include engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance, fabrication, modularization, consulting, remediation, and program management services for electric utilities, independent and merchant power producers, government agencies, multinational and national oil companies, and industrial companies. On February13, 2013 the Acquisition Closing Date, we completed the Shaw Acquisition for a gross purchase price of $3,340,070, comprised of $2,851,260in cash consideration and $488,810in equity consideration. The cash consideration was funded using $1,051,260from existing cash balances of CBI and Shaw on the Acquisition Closing Date, and the remainder was funded using debt financing, as further described in Note 10. Shaws unrestricted cash balance on the Acquisition Closing Date totaled $1,137,927, and accordingly, the cash portion of our purchase price, net of cash acquired, was $1,713,333and our total purchase price, net of cash acquired, was $2,202,143.At the Acquisition Closing Date, each issued and outstanding share of Shaw common stock, no par value other than any dissenting shares, treasury shares, or shares held by Shaw, CBI or their respective subsidiaries, was canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive i$4100in cash and iian amount of cash in Euros equal to the par value of 012883shares of CBI common stock, which cash was not actually paid, but was instead converted automatically into 012883shares of CBI common stock the Acquisition Consideration. Stock-settled and cash-settled equity-based awards relating to shares of Shaws common stock were either canceled and converted into the right to receive the Acquisition Consideration or the cash value thereof or were converted into comparable CBI awards on generally the same terms and conditions as prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. On the Acquisition Closing Date, we issued 8,893shares of CBI common stock and converted an equivalent of 1,362shares into CBI stock-settled equity-based awards. An equivalent of 473shares of CBI cash-settled equity-based awards were converted and recognized as a liability on our initial balance sheet within accrued and other non-current liabilities.From the Acquisition Closing Date through December31, 2013, revenue and income from operations associated with the Shaw Acquisition excluding acquisition and integration related costs and including intangibles amortization totaled approximately $4,010,100and $173,500, respectively. Additionally, as a result of the Shaw Acquisition, during 2013, we incurred approximately $78,200of financing related costs and $95,700of acquisition and integration related costs. Financing-55Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedrelated costs were recognized in interest expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations and included approximately $8,500of interest and fees incurred prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, and approximately $2,000of interest related to one-time commitments satisfied during the first quarter of 2013 see Note 10 for further discussion. Acquisition-related costs primarily included transaction costs, professional fees, and change-in-control and severance-related costs. Integration-related costs primarily related to facility consolidations and the associated accelerated lease costs for vacated facilities and personnel relocation costs.Purchase Price AllocationThe aggregate purchase price noted above has been allocated to the major categories of assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the Acquisition Closing Date, which were based, in part, upon outside appraisals for certain assets, including specifically-identified intangible assets and property and equipment. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, totaling $3,296,530, was recorded as goodwill.The following table summarizes our final purchase price allocation at the Acquisition Closing Date:Net tangible assets:Unrestricted  current assets615,804Property and equipment536,888Other non-current assets68,881Deferred income taxes, net 1543,479Westinghouse obligations, net 244,793Contracts in progress, net 32,317,471Accounts payable546,465Other current liabilities466,129Other non-current liabilities216,953Total net tangible assets416,660Intangible assets: 4Backlog and customer  intangible assets460,200Goodwill 53,296,530Total purchase price3,340,070Unrestricted cash acquired1,137,927Total purchase price, net of unrestricted cash acquired$2,202,1431Deferred Income TaxesDeferred income taxes represent deferred taxes recorded in connection with our purchase price allocation and include $736,490of deferred tax assets and $193,011of deferred tax liabilities2Westinghouse ObligationsWestinghouse obligations represent the net obligation we acquired associated with Shaws investment in Westinghouse and includes $1,380,086of bond obligations less $1,335,293of acquired restricted cash that was used to settle a portion of the bond obligation. See Note 10 for further discussion3Contracts in ProgressIncluded in contracts in progress is a margin fair value adjustment of approximately $745,500associated with acquired long-term contracts that were less than fair value at the Acquisition Closing Date. This margin fair value adjustment will be included in revenue on a POC basis as the applicable projects progress over approximately fiveto sixyears4Intangible AssetsAcquired intangible assets totaled $460,200and primarily consist of backlog, customer relationships and tradenames and are amortized on a straight-line basis. Backlog and customer relationships represent the fair value of existing contracts and the underlying customer relationships and have lives ranging from 2to 20years weighted average lives of approximately 16years. The fair value of acquired tradenames have lives ranging from 6to 10years weighted average lives of approximately 9years, while our other intangible assets, primarily consisting of the fair 56Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedvalue of technologies, have a life of 15years. Our total acquired intangible assets have weighted average lives of approximately 15years. During 2013, amortization for these intangible assets totaled approximately $42,0005GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and intangible assets.The factors contributing to our goodwill balance include the acquired established workforce and estimated future cost savings and revenue synergies associated with our combined operations. Of the $3,296,530of total goodwill recorded in conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition, approximately $44,200is deductible for tax purposes and is associated with the remaining portion of goodwill previously deductible by Shaw. See Note 6 for an allocation of acquired goodwill to each operating group.Significant changes in our purchase price allocation since our initial preliminary estimates reported in the first quarter 2013 were primarily related to $1,117,420of fair value adjustments associated with our acquired contracts, $41,051of increases in the fair value of property and equipment, $240,072of associated net adjustments to deferred taxes, and $58,300of increases in the fair value of intangible assets.Supplemental Pro Forma Financial InformationThe following pro forma condensed combined financial information the pro forma financial information gives effect to the acquisition of Shaw by CBI, accounted for as a business combination using the purchase method of accounting. CBIs fiscal year ends on December31, while Shaws ended on August31, prior to the Acquisition. To give effect to the Shaw Acquisition for pro forma financial information purposes, Shaws historical results were brought to within one month of CBIs interim results for the twelve month period ended December31, 2012, and included the twelve month period ended November 30, 2012. The pro forma financial information reflects the Shaw Acquisition and related events as if they occurred on January1, 2012, and gives effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Acquisition, factually supportable, and expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of CBI and Shaw following the Acquisition. The pro forma financial information includes adjustments to: 1exclude transaction costs, professional fees, and change-in-control and severance-related costs that were included in CBI and Shaws historical results and are not expected to be recurring; 2exclude the results of portions of the Shaw business that were not acquired by CBI or are not expected to have a continuing impact; 3include additional intangibles amortization and net interest expense associated with the Shaw Acquisition; and 4include the pro forma results of Shaw from January1, 2013 through the Acquisition Closing Date for the twelve month period ended December31, 2013. Adjustments, net of tax, included in the pro forma net income below that were of a non-recurring nature totaled approximately $73,300for 2013, reflecting the elimination of financing and acquisition and integration related costs. Non-recurring adjustments for the 2012period below totaled approximately $84,300, reflecting the exclusion of net income generated from portions of the Shaw business that were not acquired, as well as the elimination of acquisition and integration related costs. This pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had the pro forma events taken place on the dates indicated. Further, the pro forma financial information does not purport to project the future operating results of the combined company following the Acquisition.Year Ended December 31,20132012Pro forma  forma net income attributable to CBI $529,942$354,908Pro forma net income attributable to CBI per  AcquisitionsOn May 17, 2013, we acquired a coal gasification technology E-Gas for cash consideration of approximately $60,800. The E-Gas acquisition primarily consisted of process technology intangible assets that have an estimated life of 15years and are amortized on a straight-line basis. The impact of the acquisition was not material to our results and therefore, pro forma information has not been presented. We had no acquisitions in 2012or 201157Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued5.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLESGoodwillAt December31, 2013and 2012, our goodwill balances were $4,226,468and $926,711, respectively, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions. The change in goodwill by reporting segment for 2013and 2012was as follows:Engineering, Construction and MaintenanceFabrication ServicesTechnologyGovernment SolutionsTotalBalance at December 31,  currency  of tax goodwill in excess of book  at December 31,  Acquisition Note  currency  of tax goodwill in excess of book  at December 31,  discussed in Note 2, as part of our annual impairment assessment, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2013by comparing an estimate of discounted future cash flows to the net book value of each applicable reporting unit. Based upon this quantitative assessment, no impairment charge was necessary during 2013 as the fair value of each of the reporting units acquired in 2013exceeded their respective net book value and the fair value of all other reporting units significantly exceeded their respective net book values. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in charges to earnings.Other Intangible AssetsThe following table provides a summary of our acquired finite-lived intangible assets at December31, 2013and 2012, including weighted-average useful lives for each major intangible asset class and in total: December 31, 2013December 31,  intangible assets weighted average lifeBacklog and customer relationships 16  technologies 15  10  agreements 6  agreements 7  15 years  increase in intangibles during 2013primarily relates to approximately $460,200of intangibles acquired in connection with the Shaw Acquisition and approximately $60,800acquired in connection with our acquisition of E-Gas 58Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedboth as further discussed in Note 4, partially offset by amortization expense. Amortization expense for our intangibles existing at December31, 2013is anticipated to be approximately $67,400, $62,100, $55,700, $46,600and $45,000for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017and 2018, respectively7. PARTNERING ARRANGEMENTSAs discussed in Note 2, we account for our unconsolidated ventures primarily using the equity method of accounting. Further, we consolidate any venture that is determined to be a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary, or which we otherwise effectively control.Unconsolidated VenturesThe following is a summary description of our material unconsolidated ventures which have been accounted for using the equity method:Chevron-Lummus Global CLGWe have a venture with Chevron CBI50%, Chevron50%, which provides licenses, basic engineering services and catalyst supply for deep conversion e.g. hydrocracking, residual hydroprocessing and lubes processing. The venture is focused on converting/upgrading heavy/sour crude that is produced in the refinery process to more marketable products. As sufficient capital investments in CLG have been made by the venture partners, it does not qualify as a VIE. Additionally, we do not effectively control CLG and therefore do not consolidate the venture.NET Power LLC NET PowerWe have a commitment to invest cash and in-kind services in NET Power, a venture between CBI and various other parties, formed for the purpose of developing a new fossil fuel-based power generation technology and building a demonstration unit that is intended to produce cost-effective power with little-to-no carbon dioxide emissions. Our commitment totals $50,400and is contingent upon demonstration of various levels of feasibility of the NET Power technology and could result in up to a 50%interest in NET Power and provide for the exclusive right to engineer, procure and construct NET Power plants. At December31, 2013, we had cumulatively invested cash and in-kind services of approximately $7,200, including $4,500recognized prior to the Shaw Acquisition, and had an approximate 10%interest in NET Power. Cash and in-kind contributions subsequent to the Shaw Acquisition have been expensed within our equity earnings. We have no other material unconsolidated ventures. Dividends received from equity method joint ventures were $33,984, $20,286and $9,605during 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively.Consolidated Joint VenturesThe following is a summary description of the material joint ventures we consolidate due to their designation as VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary:CBI/KentzWe have a venture with Kentz CBI65%and Kentz35% to perform the structural, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation work on, and to provide commissioning support for, three Liquefied Natural Gas LNG trains, including associated utilities and a gas processing and compression plant, for the Gorgon LNG project, located on Barrow Island, Australia. Our CBI/Kentz project value is approximately $4,500,000.CBI/CloughWe have a venture with Clough CBI65%and Clough35% to perform the EPC work for a gas conditioning plant, nearby wellheads, and associated piping and infrastructure for the Papua New Guinea LNG project, located in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. Our CBI/Clough project value is approximately $2,000,000.CBI/AREVAWe have a venture with AREVA CBI70%, AREVA30% to design, license and construct a mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility in Aiken, South Carolina, which will be used to convert weapons-grade plutonium into fuel for nuclear power plants for the U.S. Department of Energy. Our CBI/AREVA project value is approximately $5,000,00059Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table presents summarized balance sheet information for our consolidated VIEs:December 31, 2013December31, 2012CBI/KentzCurrent assets$156,974$82,421Current  assets$122,179$145,666Current  Current assets$34,547$Current liabilities$98,478$All Other 1Current  assets$24,802$Total assets$108,172$24,536Current  ventures that we consolidate due to their designation as VIEs are not individually material and are therefore aggregated as All Other.The use of these ventures exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or to complete their obligations to us, the venture, or ultimately, our customer.

FACILITY REALIGNMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL LIABILITIESAt December31, 2013and 2012, we had a facility realignment liability related to the recognition of future operating lease expense for vacated facility capacity where we remain contractually obligated to a lessor. The liability was recognized within accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities, as applicable, based upon the anticipated timing of payment. Additionally, we had change-in-control obligations of approximately $37,000assumed in connection with the Shaw Acquisition that were paid in the third quarter 2013.

The New Revolving Facility has a borrowing sublimit of $675,000with financial letters of credit not to exceed $270,000 and certain financial covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of 300, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 175, and a minimum net worth level calculated as $1,717,648at December31, 2013. The New Revolving Facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets, liens, investments, type of business conducted, and mergers and acquisitions, and includes a trailing twelve-month limitation of $250,000for dividend payments and share repurchases if our leverage ratio exceeds 150unlimited if our leverage ratio is equal to or below 150, among other restrictions. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. 62Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe interest, letter of credit fee, and commitment fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event that we borrow funds under the facility, interest is assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin 05%at December31, 2013, or LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin 15%at December31, 2013. At December31, 2013, we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility, but had $230,388of outstanding letters of credit, providing $1,119,612of available capacity. Such letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance payments and performance guarantees, in lieu of retention on our contracts, or in certain cases, are issued in support of our insurance program. We also have a five-year, $650,000, committed and unsecured revolving credit facility the Second Revolving Facility with BofA, as administrative agent, and Credit Agricole, as syndication agent, which expires in February 2018. The Second Revolving Facility supplements our New Revolving Facility, has a $487,500borrowing sublimit, and was amended effective October 28, 2013 to include financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the New Revolving Facility. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, letter of credit fee, and commitment fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event we borrow funds under the facility, interest is assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin 05%at December31, 2013 or LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin 15%at December31, 2013. At December31, 2013, we had $115,000of outstanding borrowings and $76,533outstanding letters of credit under the facility, providing $458,467of available capacity. During 2013, our maximum outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were $516,529and the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 31%.Term LoansAt December31, 2013, we had $925,000remaining on our four-year, $1,000,000unsecured Term Loan with BofA as administrative agent, which was used to fund a portion of the Shaw Acquisition on the Acquisition Closing Date. Interest and principal under the Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin 15%at December31, 2013. However, on February 28, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge against $505,000of the $1,000,000Term Loan, which resulted in a weighted average interest rate of approximately 212%at December31, 2013, inclusive of the applicable floating margin. Future annual maturities for the Term Loan are $100,000, $100,000, $150,000and $575,000in 2014, 2015, 2016and 2017, respectively. The Term Loan was amended effective October 28, 2013 to include financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the New Revolving Facility. Senior NotesWe have a series of senior notes totaling $800,000in the aggregate Senior Notes, with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Incorporated, and Credit Agricole, as administrative agents, which were used to fund a portion of the Shaw Acquisition. The Senior Notes were funded into an escrow account on December28, 2012, and were restricted from use until the Acquisition Closing Date. Accordingly, the escrowed funds were recorded as restricted cash, and the Senior Notes were recorded as long-term debt, on our December31, 2012 Balance Sheet. The Senior Notes have financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the New Revolving Facility. The Senior Notes include Series A through D, which contain the following terms:Series AInterest due semi-annually at a fixed rate of 415%, with principal of $150,000due in December 2017Series BInterest due semi-annually at a fixed rate of 457%, with principal of $225,000due in December 2019Series CInterest due semi-annually at a fixed rate of 515%, with principal of $275,000due in December 2022Series DInterest due semi-annually at a fixed rate of 530%, with principal of $150,000due in December 2024Uncommitted FacilitiesWe also have various short-term, uncommitted revolving credit facilities across several geographic regions of approximately $1,980,749. These facilities are generally used to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance payments and performance guarantees, in lieu of retention on our contracts. At December31, 2013, we had $753,470of outstanding letters of credit under these facilities, providing $1,227,279of available capacity. In addition to providing letters of credit or bank guarantees, we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance. At December31, 2013, we had $667,457of outstanding surety bonds. Westinghouse BondsIn 2006, Shaw purchased a 20%equity interest in Westinghouse Electric Company WEC, the majority-owner of which is Toshiba Corporation Toshiba. Shaws total cost of the equity investment was approximately$1,100,000, which was financed through the Japanese private placement market by issuing 128,980,000Japanese Yen JPY equivalent to approximately $1,100,000at the time of issuance limited recourse bonds the Westinghouse Bonds. In conjunction with Shaws investment in Westinghouse, Shaw also entered into JPY-denominated put option agreements the Put Option that provided Shaw an option to sell its investment in Westinghouse to Toshiba for 967%of the original investment value approximately 124,724,000JPY or approximately $1,064,000. In October 2012, Shaw exercised the Put Option, which required Toshiba to fund approximately 124,724,000JPY approximately $1,309,000 into a JPY-denominated trust account for 63Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedpurposes of repaying the Westinghouse Bonds on their maturity date of March 15, 2013.

On March 15, 2013, the Westinghouse Bond holders were repaid from proceeds of the trust account and a payment by CBI for the remaining 33%shortfall of the principal amount approximately 4,256,000JPY or $44,800. The Westinghouse Bonds, and the associated cash funded by Toshiba into the trust account, were included in Shaws Acquisition Closing Date balance sheet. See Note 4 for further discussion of the purchase price allocation associated with the Shaw Acquisition.Compliance and OtherAt December31, 2013, we were in compliance with all of our restrictive and financial covenants, associated with our debt and revolving credit facilities. Capitalized interest was insignificant in 2013, 2012and 201111. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSForeign Currency Exchange Rate DerivativesOperating ExposuresAt December31, 2013, the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange-related operating exposures was approximately $131,800. These contracts vary in duration, maturing up to threeyears from period-end. We designate certain of these hedges as cash flow hedges and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. We exclude forward points, which are recognized as ineffectiveness within cost of revenue and are not material to our earnings, from our hedge assessment analysis.Interest Rate DerivativesInterest Rate ExposuresOn February 28, 2013, we entered into a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with $505,000of our $1,000,000Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through December31, 2013. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the hedge are recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings.Financial Instruments DisclosuresFair ValueFinancial instruments are required to be categorized within a valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows:Level 1Fair value is based upon quoted prices in active markets. Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy as they are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.Level 2Fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, as their basis, readily observable market parameters. Our derivative positions are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as they are valued using quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. These level 2 derivatives are valued utilizing an income approach, which discounts future cash flow based upon current market expectations and adjusts for credit risk.Level 3Fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, as their basis, significant unobservable market parameters. We did not have any Level 3 classifications at December31, 2013or 201264Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table presents the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, foreign currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives at December31, 2013and 2012, respectively, by valuation hierarchy and balance sheet classification:December 31, 2013December 31, 2012Level 1Level2Level3TotalLevel 1Level2Level3TotalAssetsCash and cash  cash800,000800,000Derivatives 1Other current  non-current assets4,7054,70555Total assets at fair  Accrued  non-current  liabilities at fair  are exposed to credit risk on our hedging instruments associated with potential counterparty non-performance, and the fair value of our derivatives reflects this credit risk. The total level 2 assets at fair value above represent the maximum loss that we would incur on our outstanding hedges if the applicable counterparties failed to perform according to the hedge contracts. To help mitigate counterparty credit risk, we transact only with counterparties that are rated as investment grade or higher and monitor all counterparties on a continuous basis.The carrying values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. At December31, 2013, the fair value of our Term Loan, based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity, approximated its carrying value as interest is based upon LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin. Our Senior Notes are categorized within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy and had a total fair value of approximately $753,700at December31, 2013, based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities. 65Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedDerivatives DisclosuresFair ValueThe following table presents the total fair value by underlying risk and balance sheet classification for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges at December31, 2013and 2012:Asset DerivativesLiability DerivativesFair ValueFair ValueBalance  2013December31, 2012Balance  2013December31, 2012Derivatives designated as cash flow hedgesInterest  currencyOther currentand  and  not designated as cash flow hedgesInterest rateOther currentand non-currentassets$$Accrued and  currencyOther currentand  and  fair  Netting ArrangementsOur derivatives are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association MNAs, which generally allow us and our counterparties to net settle, in a single net payable or receivable, obligations due on the same day, in the same currency and for the same type of derivative instrument.

The primary goal is to optimize the asset mix to fund future benefit obligations, while managing various risk factors and each plans investment return objectives.Our defined benefit plan assets in the U.S. are invested in a well-diversified portfolio of equities including U.S. large, mid and small-capitalization and international equities and fixed income securities including corporate and government bonds. Non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets are similarly invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity, fixed income and other securities.

Under our program in the U.S., certain eligible current and future retirees are covered by a defined fixed dollar benefit, under which our costs for each participant are fixed, based upon prior years of service of retired employees. Additionally, there is a closed group of U.S. retirees for which we assume some or all of the cost of coverage. For this group, health care cost trend rates are projected at annual rates ranging from 75%in 2014down 72Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedto 50%in 2018and beyond. Under the U.S. program, since 2011, new employees are not eligible for post-retirement medical benefits. During 2012, benefits under our former U.K. plan were terminated.Increasing decreasing the assumed health care cost trends by one percentage point for our U.S. program is estimated to increase decrease the total of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement health care cost for 2013and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December31, 2013, as  on total of service and interest cost$62$56Effect on postretirement benefit  Pension PlansWe contribute to certain union sponsored multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Benefits under these plans are generally based upon years of service and compensation levels. Under U.S. legislation regarding such pension plans, the risks of participation are different than single-employer pension plans as 1assets contributed to the plan by a company may be used to provide benefits to participants of other companies, 2if a participating company discontinues contributions to a plan, other participating companies may have to cover any unfunded liability that may exist, and 3a company is required to continue funding its proportionate share of a plans unfunded vested benefits in the event of withdrawal as defined by the legislation from a plan or plan termination.

We made contributions to our multi-employer plans of $102,025, $13,271and $12,170during 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, for these additional benefits, including $82,313in 2013associated with plans acquired in the Shaw Acquisition13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLeasesCertain facilities and equipment, including project-related field equipment, are rented under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2035. Rent expense for operating leases was $147,100including $64,805associated with operating leases acquired in the Shaw Acquisition, $76,880and $73,835in 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. Future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases having initial terms of one year or more are as  1$508,9591Approximately $16,000of minimum lease payments above are contractually recoverable through our cost-reimbursable projects.Certain lease agreements contain escalation provisions based upon specific future inflation indices which could impact the future minimum payments presented above. The costs related to leases with an initial term of less than one year have been reflected in rent expense but have been excluded from the future minimum payments presented above.Legal ProceedingsWe have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects, technology licenses, other services we provide, and other matters. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of projects, performance of equipment or technologies, design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by us. We do not believe that any of our pending contractual, employment-related personal injury or property damage claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. See Note 17 for additional discussion of claims associated with our projects.Asbestos LitigationWe are a defendant in lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed at various locations. We have never been a manufacturer, distributor or supplier of asbestos products. Over the past several decades and through December31, 2013, we have been named a defendant in lawsuits alleging exposure to 75Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedasbestos involving approximately 5,300plaintiffs and, of those claims, approximately 1,400claims were pending and 3,900have been closed through dismissals or settlements. Over the past several decades and through December31, 2013, the claims alleging exposure to asbestos that have been resolved have been dismissed or settled for an average settlement amount of approximately two thousanddollars per claim. We review each case on its own merits and make accruals based upon the probability of loss and our estimates of the amount of liability and related expenses, if any. We do not believe that any unresolved asserted claims will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow, and at December31, 2013, we had approximately $3,600accrued for liability and related expenses. With respect to unasserted asbestos claims, we cannot identify a population of potential claimants with sufficient certainty to determine the probability of a loss and to make a reasonable estimate of liability, if any. While we continue to pursue recovery for recognized and unrecognized contingent losses through insurance, indemnification arrangements or other sources, we are unable to quantify the amount, if any, that we may expect to recover because of the variability in coverage amounts, limitations and deductibles, or the viability of carriers, with respect to our insurance policies for the years in question.Environmental MattersOur operations are subject to extensive and changing U.S.federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws of other countries, that establish health and environmental quality standards. These standards, among others, relate to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes.In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, including those associated with acquired operations, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred.We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations and maintain insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We do not believe any environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. We do not anticipate we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or for the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during 2014or 2015.Letters of Credit/Bank Guarantees/Surety BondsIn the ordinary course of business, we may obtain surety bonds and letters of credit, which we provide to our customers to secure advance payment or our performance under our contracts, or in lieu of retention being withheld on our contracts. In the event of our non-performance under a contract and an advance being made by a bank pursuant to a draw on a letter of credit, the advance would become a borrowing under a credit facility and thus our direct obligation. Where a surety incurs such a loss, an indemnity agreement between the parties and us may require payment from our excess cash or a borrowing under our credit facilities. When a contract is completed, the contingent obligation terminates and the bonds or letters of credit are returned. At December31, 2013, we had provided $1,640,520of surety bonds and letters of credit to support our contracting activities in the ordinary course of business. This amount fluctuates based upon the mix and level of contracting activity.InsuranceWe have elected to retain portions of future losses, if any, through the use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to third-party liability and workers compensation. Liabilities in excess of these amounts are the responsibilities of an insurance carrier. To the extent we are self-insured for these exposures, reserves see Note 8 have been provided based upon our best estimates, with input from our legal and insurance advisors. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change in the near term. We believe that reasonably possible losses, if any, for these matters, to the extent not otherwise disclosed and net of recorded reserves, will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. At December31, 2013, we had outstanding surety bonds and letters of credit of $87,328relating to our insurance programs.Income TaxesWe provide income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, in situations where we have and have not received tax assessments. Tax and associated interest reserves are provided in those instances where we consider it more likely than not, that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide. We continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and, as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense, respectively76Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued14. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITYStock Held in TrustFrom time to time, we grant restricted shares to key employees under our Long-Term Incentive Plan see Note 15. Prior to 2010, restricted shares granted were transferred to a rabbi trust the Trust, and the shares remaining in the Trust were held until the vesting restrictions lapse, at which time the shares were released from the Trust and distributed to the applicable employees. Beginning in 2010, restricted shares were no longer transferred to the Trust upon grant, but instead are distributed directly to the applicable employees upon vesting. At December31, 2013, there were no restricted shares remaining in the Trust. Treasury StockUnder Dutch law and our Articles of Association, we may hold no more than 10%of our issued share capital at any time.AOCIAs noted in the New Accounting Standards section of Note 2, additional AOCI disclosures are required, including 1changes in AOCI balances by component and 2significant items reclassified from AOCI into earnings.

STOCK-SETTLED AND CASH-SETTLED EQUITY BASED PLANSGeneralUnder our Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan, we can issue shares to employees and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units RSUs or performance shares. This plan is administered by the Organization and Compensation Committee of our Board of Supervisory Directors, which selects those employees eligible to receive awards and determines the number of shares or options subject to each award, as well as the terms, conditions, performance measures, and other provisions of the award. Additionally, in conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition, we issued 8,893shares of CBI common stock, 1,362CBI stock-settled equity-based awards and 473cash-settled equity-based awards. As discussed in Note 4, at the Acquisition Closing Date, unvested and unexercised stock-settled equity-based awards including stock options and RSUs, and cash-settled equity-based awards including RSUs and stock appreciation rights SARs, relating to shares of Shaws common stock were either canceled and converted into the right to receive the Acquisition Consideration or the cash value thereof or were converted into comparable CBI stock-settled or cash-settled equity-based awards with generally the same terms and conditions as prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. Our cash-settled equity-based awards only relate to the unvested Shaw awards existing at the Acquisition Closing Date that were replaced with CBI equivalent awards. We had no additional cash-settled equity-based grants during 2013. A description of awards issued in conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition is further discussed within the award categories below. Compensation expense related to our Incentive Plan was $62,251including $8,650of expense associated with the Shaw Acquisition, $39,526and $33,969for 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. In addition, we recognized $10,975of expense within acquisition and integration related costs, primarily in the first quarter of 2013, as a result of accelerated vesting for terminated employees associated with the Shaw Acquisition. At December31, 2013, 6,030authorized shares remained available under the Incentive Plan for future stock option, restricted share or performance share grants.Under our employee stock purchase plan ESPP, employees may make quarterly purchases of shares at a discount through regular payroll deductions for up to 8%of their compensation. The shares are purchased at 85%of the closing price per share on the first trading day following the end of the calendar quarter. Compensation expense related to our ESPP, representing the difference between the fair value on the date of purchase and the price paid, was $2,188, $1,474and $1,329for 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013, 4,090authorized shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP.Total stock-based compensation expense for the Incentive Plan and ESPP was $64,439, $41,000and $35,298during 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. At December31, 2013, there was $63,901of unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based grants, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 15years.We receive a tax deduction during the period in which certain options are exercised, generally for the difference in the option exercise price and the price of the shares at the date of exercise intrinsic value. Additionally, we receive a tax deduction upon the vesting of RSUs and performance shares for the price of the shares at the date of vesting. The total recognized tax benefit based on our compensation expense was $25,123, $13,309and $11,331for 2013, 2012and 2011, respectively. The amount of tax deductions in excess of accumulated tax benefits recognized is reflected as a financing cash flow.Stock OptionsStock options are generally granted at the market value on the date of grant and expire after 10years. Options granted to employees generally vest over a period ranging from threeto sevenyears; however, Shaw stock options converted to CBI stock options in conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition continue to vest annually on a ratable basis over a four-year period from the original grant date. Total initial fair value for all option awards was determined based upon the calculated Black-Scholes fair value of each stock option at the date of grant the Acquisition Closing Date for converted Shaw stock options applied to the total number of options that were anticipated to fully vest. This fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated vesting period, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2013, all of which were Shaw stock options that were converted to CBI stock options in conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition, was $2005. There were nostock options granted during 2012, and the weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 2011was $2053. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during 2013, 2012and 2011was $23,546, $9,551and $13,789, respectively. From the exercise of stock options in 2013, we received net cash proceeds of $24,452and realized an actual income tax benefit of $7,72178Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedThe following table represents stock option activity for 2013:Number  ShareWeighted  options at beginning of  / Expired158$5951Outstanding options at end of year  options at end of year859$236543$51,0791We estimate that 1,026of these options will ultimately vest. These options have a weighted-average exercise price per share of $2481, a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 45years and a current aggregate intrinsic value of $59,860.Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the fair value of each option granted during 2013and 2011was estimated on the grant date based upon the following weighted-average assumptions:20132011Risk-free interest rate016%285%Expected dividend yield038%059%Expected  life in years56The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve on the grant date, expected dividend yield was based on dividend levels at the grant date, expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our stock, and the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. We also use historical information to estimate option exercises and forfeitures.RSUsOur Incentive Plan allows for the issuance of RSUs that may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed, which is generally over a four-year graded vesting period; however, unvested RSUs and certain cash units granted to Shaw employees subsequent to July 30, 2012, the date of the Acquisition Agreement, were converted to CBI RSUs at the Acquisition Closing Date and continue to vest over the three-year period from the original grant date. Total initial fair value for our RSUs was determined based upon the market price of our stock at the grant date the Acquisition Closing Date for Shaw awards converted to CBI RSUs applied to the total number of shares that we anticipate will fully vest. This fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable.

The total fair value of restricted shares that vested during 2013, 2012, and 2011was $32,041, $32,212and $25,208, respectively.Performance SharesOur Incentive Plan allows for the issuance of performance share awards that are subject to achievement of specific Company performance goals and generally vest over threeyears. Total initial fair value for these awards is determined based upon the market price of our stock at the grant date applied to the total number of shares that we anticipate will fully vest. This fair value is expensed ratably over the vesting term, subject to retirement eligibility expense acceleration, where applicable. As a result of performance conditions being met during 2013, we recognized $31,017of compensation expense. During 2013, 366performance shares were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $5740. During 2012, 301performance shares were granted with a weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of $4442.

During 2013, we distributed 667performance shares upon vesting and achievement of certain performance goals. The total fair value of performance shares that vested during 2013was $35,258.Cash-Settled Equity-Based AwardsIn conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition, we converted certain Shaw cash-settled equity-based awards into comparable CBI awards, with generally the same terms and conditions as prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, including 307unvested cash-settled RSUs and 166cash-settled SARs 62exercisable and 104unvested SARs, with weighted-average exercise prices of $3338and $3339, respectively and weighted-average remaining contractual lives of 75years. Cash-settled RSUs allow the holder to receive cash equal to the value of the underlying RSUs at pre-determined vesting dates and they vest over a three-year period from the original grant date. Cash-settled SARs allow the holder to receive cash equal to the difference between CBIs equivalent exercise price and the market value of our stock on the exercise date, and they vest over a four-year period from the original grant date and expire tenyears from the original grant date. Compensation cost for cash-settled RSUs and SARs is re-measured each reporting period and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. These awards are re-measured based on CBIs closing stock price on the last business day of each reporting period using a Black-Scholes valuation model.The following table presents cash-settled RSU activity for  FairValue per ShareNonvested Cash-Settled RSUsBalance at beginning of year$Granted 1307$5211Vested  at end of year137$52111All cash-settled RSUs granted during 2013were Shaw cash-settled RSUs that were converted to CBI cash-settled RSUs in conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition.

With respect to tax consequences of repatriating our foreign earnings, distributions from our European Union subsidiaries to their Netherlands parent companies are not subject to taxation. Further, for our non-European Union companies and their subsidiaries and our U.S. companies, to the extent taxes apply, the amount of permanently reinvested earnings becomes taxable upon repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or liquidation of the subsidiary. We have accrued taxes on undistributed earnings that we intend to repatriate and we intend to permanently reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings in their respective businesses and, accordingly, have accrued no taxes on such amounts. The determination of any deferred tax liability related to permanently reinvested earnings is not practicable. On a periodic and ongoing basis we evaluate our deferred tax assets DTAs and assess the appropriateness of our valuation allowances. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the DTAs. If, based on the weight of available evidence, our assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that a DTA will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance. Our assessments include, among other things, the value and quality of our backlog, evaluations of existing and anticipated market conditions, analysis of recent and historical operating results and projections of future results, strategic plans and alternatives for associated operations, as well as asset expiration dates, where applicable. At December 31, 2012, we had a recorded net operating loss NOL DTA for our operations in the United Kingdom U.K. of $21,900, net of a valuation allowance against $74,600of U.K. NOL DTAs for which we believed it was more likely than not that the NOLs would not be utilized. The U.K. NOL DTA was recorded in 2007 and 2008 and related to losses incurred 83Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedduring those years on two large fixed-price projects that were completed in the first quarter of 2010. Prior to 2013, the negative evidence with respect to the uncertainty of future earnings for our U.K. operations out-weighed the positive evidence of recent periods of profitability, and therefore, we previously had no release of valuation allowance since the U.K. NOL DTA was recorded. However, during 2013 our current year results for the U.K. significantly exceeded our previous expectations, due primarily to growth on existing projects, new awards for 2013, and better recovery of fixed overhead costs, such that in 2013 we fully utilized our recorded U.K. NOL DTA, and accordingly, a release of valuation allowance was required. In determining the amount of valuation allowance to release, we gave consideration to the aforementioned factors, and more specifically, the heavily weighted positive evidence of the sustained U.K. operating results, including recent operating results significantly exceeding 2013 plan expectations, and a stronger than previously anticipated backlog and outlook for our U.K. operations as derived from our annual fourth quarter planning process. Based on this assessment, and considering the indefinite-lived nature of the U.K. NOLs, we concluded that the positive evidence now out-weighed the negative evidence with respect to realization of the unrecorded U.K. NOL DTA and determined it was more likely than not that the unrecorded U.K. NOL DTA was realizable. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2013, our full valuation allowance related to the U.K. NOL DTA was reversed, resulting in a decrease in tax expense of $62,800. If the factors upon which we based our assessment of realizability of the U.K. NOL DTA differ materially from our expectations, including future operating results being lower than our current estimates, our future assessments could be impacted and result in an increase in valuation allowance and increase in tax expense. At December31, 2013, we had total Non-U.S. net operating losses NOLs of $453,200, including $293,600in the U.K. and $159,600in other jurisdictions. We believe it is more likely than not that $153,800of Non-U.S. NOLs in jurisdictions other than the U.K., will not be utilized and have placed a valuation allowance against these NOLs. Accordingly, at December31, 2013, our net deferred tax asset DTA associated with Non-U.S. NOLs was $62,300. Excluding NOLs having an indefinite carryforward, principally in the U.K., the Non-U.S. NOLs will expire from 2014to 2033. At December31, 2013, we had foreign tax credits FTCs and other tax credits of $53,400and $6,500, respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the credits will be realized within the carryforward period. At December31, 2013, we had U.S. Federal NOLs of $339,900. Of the U.S. Federal NOLs, $18,400were generated prior to 2013 and will expire in 2021. The remaining $321,500of U.S. Federal NOLs will expire in 2033. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the U.S. Federal NOLs will be utilized. Accordingly, at December31, 2013, our DTA associated with the U.S. Federal NOLs was $119,000. At December31, 2013, we had a DTA associated with U.S.-State NOLs of $58,800. We believe it is more likely than not that $54,500of the U.S.-State NOL DTA, will not be utilized and accordingly, a valuation allowance has been placed against these U.S.-State NOLs, of which approximately $47,600was recorded at the Acquisition Closing Date. The U.S.-State NOLs will expire from 2014to 2033.During 2013, our valuation allowance decreased by approximately $37,100, primarily due to an increase of approximately $47,600recorded at the Acquisition Closing Date related to the aforementioned U.S.-State NOL DTAs, and approximately $14,000primarly related to the establishment of valuation allowance for certain U.S.-State NOLs and NOLs for certain international operations, offset by the release of valuation allowance of $62,800and $28,200, related to the aforementioned U.K. NOL DTA and FTCs, respectively, and approximately $7,700related to changes in tax rates, the release of other valuation allowance and foreign exchange movements84Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ContinuedUnrecognized Income Tax BenefitsAt December31, 2013, our unrecognized income tax benefits totaled $14,281and we do not anticipate significant changes in this balance in the next twelve months. If these income tax benefits are ultimately recognized, $11,142would affect the effective tax rate as we are contractually indemnified for the remaining balances. The following is a reconciliation of our unrecognized income tax benefits for the years ended December31, 2013and 2012:Years Ended December 31,20132012Unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the year$5,169$7,374Increase as a result of:Shaw Acquisition6,445Tax positions taken during the current period3,3331,530Decreases as a result of:Tax positions taken during prior periodsLapse of applicable statute of limitations241Settlements with taxing  income tax benefits at the end of the year$14,281$5,169We have operations, and are subject to taxation, in various jurisdictions, including significant operations in the U.S., The Netherlands, Canada, the U.K., Australia, South America and the Middle East. Tax years remaining subject to examination by worldwide tax jurisdictions vary by country and legal entity, but are generally open for tax years ending after 2005. To the extent penalties and associated interest are assessed on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts are accrued and classified as a component of income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. For 2013and 2012, interest was not significant. However, in 2011, the net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits noted above resulted in a net reversal of associated accrued interest of approximately $3,900. For 2013, 2012, and 2011, penalties were not significant17. UNAPPROVED CHANGE ORDERS, CLAIMS, INCENTIVES AND OTHER CONTRACT RECOVERIES We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred, the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable, and we recognize revenue associated with incentive fees when the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. In addition, we include in contract price amounts contractually recoverable from our customers and consortium partners. Nuclear ProjectsWe have consortium agreements the Consortium Agreements with WEC under which we have contracted with twoseparate customers the Customer Contracts for the construction of twonuclear power plants in Georgia the Georgia Nuclear Project and South Carolina collectively with the Georgia Nuclear Project, the Nuclear Projects. The Nuclear Projects are reflected within our Engineering, Construction and Maintenance and Fabrication Services operating groups. Under the scope of work provided in each of the Consortium Agreements, WEC is primarily responsible for engineering and procurement activities associated with the nuclear island component of the Nuclear Projects, while we are responsible for engineering, procurement and fabrication for the balance of plant and substantially all of the construction activities for the Nuclear Projects. The Customer Contracts provide WEC and us contractual entitlement Customer Obligations for recovery of certain estimated costs in excess of contractually stipulated amounts. In addition to the aforementioned protections for us under the Customer Contracts, the Consortium Agreements also provide contractual entitlement for us to recover from WEC WEC Obligations certain estimated costs in excess of contractually stipulated amounts, to the extent not recoverable from our customers. Project price for the Nuclear Projects includes estimated amounts recoverable under the aforementioned Customer Obligations and WEC Obligations.We have unapproved change orders and claims with our customer for the Georgia Nuclear Project resulting from increased engineering, equipment supply, material and fabrication and construction costs resulting from regulatory-required design changes and delays in our customers obtaining the combined operating license COL for the project. Specifically, we have entered into a formal dispute resolution process on certain claims associated with the shield building, large structural modules and COL issuance delays. At December31, 2013, we had approximately $838,600included in project price related to the unapproved change orders and claims. To the extent we are unsuccessful recovering these amounts from our customer, the amounts are contractually recoverable under the aforementioned WEC Obligations. Through December 31, 2013, approximately $85,200had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative POC basis related to the amounts included in project price. Although we have not reached resolution with our customer for the aforementioned matters, at December31, 2013, we 85Table of ContentsChicago Bridge Iron Company N.V.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continuedhad received contractually required partial payments from our customer totaling approximately $96,500related to the unapproved change order and claim amounts. We believe the amounts included in project price related to the unapproved change orders and claims, and the Customer Obligations and WEC Obligations, are recoverable under the aforementioned provisions of our contractual arrangements and reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts. The Nuclear Projects have long construction durations and the cost estimates cover costs that will be incurred over several years. It is anticipated that these commercial matters may not be resolved in the near term. If we do not resolve these matters for the amounts recorded, or to the extent we are not successful in recovering amounts contractually due under the Customer Obligations or WEC Obligations, or to the extent there are future cost increases on the Nuclear Projects that we cannot recover under either the Customer Obligations or WEC Obligations, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.OtherWe had additional unapproved change orders and claims included in project price totaling approximately $97,000and $47,100at December31, 2013and 2012, respectively, related to other projects within our Engineering, Construction and Maintenance and Fabrication Services operating groups, and incentives of approximately $49,200at December31, 2013for projects in our Engineering, Construction and Maintenance and Government Solutions operating groups. Of these amounts, approximately $88,200had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative POC basis through December31, 2013. At December31, 2013, we also had receivables outstanding for one of our large cost reimbursable projects totaling approximately $127,500that are significantly past due. Although the amounts may not be received in the near term, the amounts are contractually due under the provisions of our contract. The aforementioned amounts recorded in project price and receivables reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows18. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATIONSegment InformationIn conjunction with the Shaw Acquisition, beginning in the first quarter of 2013, our management structure and internal and public segment reporting were aligned based upon the expanded services offered by the following fourdistinct operating groups, which represent our reportable segments:Engineering, Construction and MaintenanceEngineering, Construction and Maintenance provides engineering, procurement, and construction for major energy infrastructure facilities, as well as comprehensive and integrated maintenance services. This segment includes our Oil and Gas segment formerly our Project Engineering and Construction segment and Shaws former Power and Plant Services segments.
