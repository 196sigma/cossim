Item 8.Financial Statements and
Supplemental Data Our management is responsible for the information
and representations contained in this report. The financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
which we considered appropriate in the circumstances and include
some amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other
financial information in this report is consistent with these
financial statements. Our accounting systems include controls designed
to reasonably assure that assets are safeguarded from
unauthorized use or disposition and which provide for the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These systems are supplemented by the selection and
training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational
structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties. The Audit Committee is responsible for
recommending to the Board of Directors the appointment of the
independent accountants and reviews with the independent
accountants and management the scope and the results of the
annual examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control
system and other matters relating to our financial affairs as
they deem appropriate. 22 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Columbia Sportswear Company We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Columbia Sportswear Company and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Columbia Sportswear Company and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

statements. 27 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Note 1 Basis of Presentation and
Organization Nature
of the business Columbia Sportswear Company is a global leader in
the design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of active
outdoor apparel, including outerwear, sportswear, footwear, and
related accessories. Note 2 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Basis
of presentation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Columbia Sportswear Co. and all wholly-owned
subsidiaries, including GTS Inc., Columbia Sportswear Canada
Ltd., Columbia Sportswear Holdings, Ltd., Columbia Sportswear
Japan Ltd., Columbia Sportswear Germany GmbH, Columbia
Sportswear France SNC., Columbia Sportswear Company Ltd.,
Columbia Sportswear Korea, Sorel Corporation, Columbia
Sportswear S.A.S., Columbia Sportswear International A.G.,
Columbia Sportswear North America Inc., and Columbia Sportswear
Europe S.A.S., collectively, the Company. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. Certain reclassifications of amounts reported in
the prior period financial statements have been made to conform
to classifications used in the current period financial
statements. Dependence
on key suppliers The Companys products are produced by
independent manufacturers worldwide. For 2001 the Company
sourced approximately 97% by dollar volume of its products
outside the United States, principally in the Far East. Three
major factory groups accounted for approximately 17% of the
Companys total global production for 2001 and another
company produced substantially all of the zippers used in the
Companys products. From time to time, the Company has
experienced difficulty satisfying its raw material and finished
goods requirements. Although the Company believes that it could
identify and qualify additional factories to produce these
materials, the unavailability of some existing manufacturers for
supply of these materials could have a material adverse affect
on the Company. Cash
and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and
short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of acquisition. Accounts
receivable Accounts receivable have been reduced by an
allowance for doubtful accounts, which was $8,016,000 and
$5,826,000 in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The net charges to
this reserve were $1,341,000, $3,563,000 and $3,177,000 in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. 28 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Property,
plant, and equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation of machinery and equipment, furniture and
fixtures and amortization of leasehold improvements is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10years. Buildings are
depreciated using the straight-line method over 30years. The interest-carrying costs of capital assets
under construction are capitalized based on the Companys
weighted average borrowing rates. Capitalized interest was
$792,000, $145,000 and $281,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Intangibles
and other assets In September 2000, the Company acquired the Sorel
trademark rights, associated brand names and other related
intellectual property rights for $7,967,000 in cash. The
acquired intangible assets are being amortized over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over ten years.
The related accumulated amortization was $996,000 and $199,000
at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Impairment
of long-lived and intangible assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of
long-lived assets for possible impairment as events or changes
arise indicating that such assets should be reviewed. If an
asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured as the
amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair
value. Fair value is based on the best information available,
including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation
techniques. The Company has determined that its long-lived
assets as of December31, 2001 and 2000 are not impaired. Deferred
income taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary
differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for
financial and tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when it is estimated to be more
likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Revenue
Recognition Revenue for wholesale operations and licensing is
recognized at the time the merchandise is shipped to customers.
Retail store revenue is recognized at the time of sale.
Allowances for estimated returns are provided when sales are
recorded. Foreign
currency translation The assets and liabilities of the Companys
foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars
using the exchange rates in effect at period end, and the net
sales and expenses have been translated into U.S. dollars using
average exchange rates in effect during the period. The foreign
currency translation adjustments are included as a separate
component of shareholders equity and are not currently
adjusted for income taxes as they relate to indefinite net
investments in non-U.S. operations. Fair
value of financial instruments Based on borrowing rates currently available to
the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities,
the fair value of the Companys long-term debt approximates
the carrying value. Furthermore, the carrying value of all other
financial instruments potentially subject to valuation risk
principally consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable also approximate fair value
because of their short-term maturities. 29 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Advertising
costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising expense was $35,011,000, $27,343,000, and
$20,725,000 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000,
and 1999, respectively. Product
warranty Substantially all of the Companys products
carry lifetime limited warranty provisions for defects in
quality and workmanship. A reserve is established at the time of
sale to cover estimated warranty costs based on the
Companys history of warranty repairs and replacements.
Warranty expense was approximately $2,672,000, $3,325,000, and
$3,127,000 for the years ended December31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Recent
Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The statement
eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain intangible
assets with indefinite useful lives and instead sets forth
methods to periodically evaluate these assets for impairment.
SFAS No. 142 becomes effective for the Company beginning
January1, 2002. Management has evaluated the impact of the
adoption of SFAS No142 and has determined that this
standard will not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position or the results of operations. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. SFAS No144 establishes a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of and
replaces SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of, and APB Opinion No30, Reporting Results
of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business. The provisions of this statement
are effective beginning with fiscal years starting after
December15, 2001. Management has evaluated the impact of
the adoption of this standard and has determined that this
standard will not have a material impact on the Companys
financial position or the results of operations. Note 3 Inventories, Net Inventories consist of the following in

Credit Lines The Company has available an unsecured and
committed operating line of credit providing for borrowings in
an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding
1$50,000,000 during the period of July15 through
December15 of the calendar year, 2$25,000,000
during the period of December16 through February15
of the calendar year and 3$10,000,000 at all other
times. The maturity date of this agreement is June30,
2003. Interest, payable monthly, is computed at the banks
prime rate minus up to 205% per annum. The agreement also
includes a fixed rate option based on the LIBOR rate plus up to
65 basis points. There was no balance outstanding on this line
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000. The unsecured operating line
of credit requires the Company to comply with certain covenants
including a Capital Ratio, which limits indebtedness to tangible
net worth. As of December31, 2001, the Company was in
compliance with all of these covenants. If the Company defaults
on its payments, it is prohibited, subject to certain
exceptions, from making dividend payments or other distributions. The Company has arrangements in place to
facilitate the import and purchase of inventory through the
issuance of sight letters of credit. The arrangements consist of
an unsecured and uncommitted revolving line of credit of
$25,000,000 and a $75,000,000 import line of credit to issue
documentary letters of credit on a sight basis and renewed on an
annual basis. The combined limit under this agreement is
$100,000,000. The revolving line accrues interest at the
banks prime rate minus 2% per annum. The revolving line
also has a fixed rate option based on the banks cost of
funds plus 45 basis points. There was no balance outstanding on
this line as of December31, 2001 and 2000. At
December31, 2001, the Company had $42,360,000 of firm
purchase orders placed under this facility. The Company also has available an unsecured and
uncommitted $100,000,000 import letter of credit line subject to
annual renewal. At December31, 2001, the Company had
$46,844,000 of firm purchase orders placed under this facility. The Company is party to certain Buying Agency
Agreements that serve to facilitate the short-term financing and
importation of goods. Domestically, the Company has allowed
these agreements to expire during fiscal year 2001, however,
these import and related financing services will continue to be
provided to the Company through March31, 2002. Although
these agreements will expire domestically, the Companys
Canadian subsidiary will continue to utilize its agreements to
finance the purchase of goods outside of the U.S. The Canadian
subsidiary has an available line of credit under this Buying
Agency Agreement of C$19,000,000 US$11,935,000 at
December31, 2001. Borrowings bear interest at 35 basis

the acquisition of a domestic distribution center. The loan
matures in September 2003 and bears interest at 876%. In connection with capital projects, the Company
entered into a note purchase agreement. Pursuant to the note
purchase agreement, the Company issued senior promissory notes
in the aggregate principal amount of $25million, bearing
an interest rate of 668% and maturing August11, 2008.
Proceeds from the notes were used to finance the expansion of
the Companys distribution center in Portland, Oregon. The
Senior Promissory Notes require the Company to comply with
certain ratios related to indebtedness to earnings 32 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDA and tangible net worth. As of
December31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants. In June 2001, the Companys Japanese
subsidiary borrowed 550,000million Japanese yen
US$4,177,000 at December31, 2001, bearing an interest
rate of 173% at December31, 2001, for general working
capital requirements. Principal and interest are paid
semi-annually during the period July 2001 through June 2006. Principal payments due on these notes as of
December31, 2001 were as follows in thousands Year Ending December 31 2002 4,775 2003 4,682 2004 4,406 2005 4,407 2006 4,407 Thereafter 7,145 29,822 Note 8 Shareholders
Equity The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000
shares of common stock. At December31, 2001 and 2000,
39,282,921 and 38,564,171 shares of common stock were issued and
outstanding. On June9, 1999, the shareholders of the
Company approved the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
ESPP. 750,000 shares of common stock are
authorized for issuance under the ESPP, which allows qualified
employees of the Company to purchase shares on a quarterly basis
up to fifteen percent of their respective compensation. The
purchase price of the shares is equal to eighty five percent of
the lesser of the closing price of the Companys common
stock on the first or last trading day of the respective
quarter. As of December31, 2001 and 2000, 120,685 and
72,125 shares of common stock had been issued under the ESPP. Share amounts above have been restated to reflect
the three-for-two stock split that was distributed on
June4, 2001, to all shareholders of record at the close of
business on May17, 2001. Note 9 Income Taxes The Company applies an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in the Companys financial
statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax
consequences, the Company generally considers all expected
future events other than enactment of changes in the tax laws or
rates. Deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences
between assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are recorded
against net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
the asset will not be realized. Undistributed earnings of the Companys
Canadian subsidiary amounted to approximately $17,400,000 on
December31, 2001. If those earnings were distributed in
the form of dividends or otherwise, a portion would be subject
to both U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is
anticipated that the U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding
taxes would be substantially offset by the corresponding foreign
tax credits resulting from such a distribution. The Companys income taxes payable for
federal and state purposes have been reduced and the current tax
expense increased, by the tax benefits associated with
dispositions of employee stock options. The Company receives an
income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair
market value of the 33 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued stock issued at the time of exercise and the
option price, tax effected. These benefits were credited

Plan The Company has a 401k profit-sharing plan,
which covers substantially all employees with more than ninety
days of service. The Company may elect to make discretionary
matching and/or non-matching contributions. All contributions to
the plan are determined by the Board of Directors and totaled
$2,582,000, $2,106,000, and $1,860,000 for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Note 11 Participation Share
Agreement Effective December 1990, the Company adopted a
Participation Share Agreement the Participation
Plan with a key employee. The Participation Plan provided
for the grant of participation shares equivalent to 10% of the
Company, which were to be awarded at various dates through
January 2000. Shares awarded were subjected to vesting at a rate
of 20% per year. The original Participation Plan granted the
employee deferred compensation in the appreciation of a defined
per-share book value of the Company since January 1987 and
contained an anti-dilutive provision. Effective December31, 1996, the original
Participation Plan was terminated and a Deferred Compensation
Conversion Agreement the Agreement was entered
into. Under the Agreement, the participation shares, whether or
not vested or awarded under the Participation Plan, were
converted to 2,700,653 shares of common stock. As of
December31, 2001, of the converted shares, 352,250 shares
of common stock awarded were subject to vesting through December
2004. The total value of the share conversion was
$15,693,000, of which $6,320,000 was unvested as of
December31, 1996. The unvested portion was recorded as a
reduction in shareholders equity and will be amortized to
compensation expense through December 2004 as shares are earned.
Compensation expense related to the Participation Plan and the
1996 conversion totaled $682,000, $682,000, and $970,000 for the
years ended December31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Note 12 Commitments and
Contingencies The Company leases certain operating facilities
from related parties of the Company. Total rent expense,
including month-to-month rentals, for these leases amounted to
$381,000, $408,000 and $339,000 for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Rent expense was $2,568,000, $2,464,000 and
$2,303,000 for non-related party leases during the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The approximate future minimum payments on all

legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, management
believes that disposition of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. 35 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Prior to its initial public offering of common
stock on April1, 1998, the Company elected to be treated
as an S corporation under provision of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. Accordingly, payment of federal and most
state taxes on income earned in the United States was the
responsibility of the shareholders rather than the Company. In
connection with the initial public offering the Company
terminated its S corporation status and entered into
a tax indemnification agreement with each of its shareholders,
including Gertrude Boyle, TimothyP. Boyle, Sarah Bany, Don
Santorufo and certain trusts. The agreements provide that the
Company will indemnify and hold harmless each of these
shareholders for federal, state, local or foreign income tax
liabilities and costs relating thereto, resulting from any
adjustment to the Companys income that is the result of an
increase or change in character of the Companys income
during the period it was treated as an S
corporation. The agreements also provide that if there is a
determination that the Company was not an S
corporation prior to the Offerings, the shareholders will pay to
the Company certain refunds actually received by them as a
result of the determination. Note 13 Stock Incentive
Plan The Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the
Plan provides for issuance of up to 5,400,000
shares of the Companys Common Stock of which 1,826,823
shares were available for future stock option grants under the
Plan at December31, 2001. Options granted prior to 2001
generally become exercisable ratably over a five-year period
beginning from the date of grant and expire ten years from the
date of grant. Options granted in 2001 generally become
exercisable over a period of four years beginning one year after
the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of the
grant. The following table summarizes the stock option

$14,994,000, $10,163,000 and $2,417,000, respectively, which
would be amortized on a pro forma basis over the vesting period
of the options. The weighted average fair value of options
granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $2046, $988 and $534
per share, respectively. If the Company had accounted for the Plan in

Share SFAS No128, Earnings per Share
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per
share EPS. Basic EPS is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. 38 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued There were no adjustments to net income in
computing diluted earnings per share for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. A reconciliation of the

diluted earnings per share is as follows in thousands, except

three-for-two stock split that was distributed on June4,
2001, to all shareholders of record at the close of business on
May17, 2001. Options to purchase an additional 34,000, 16,000,
and 667,000 shares of common stock were outstanding at
December31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, but were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because their effect would be anti-dilutive. Note 16 Financial Risk Management
and Derivatives Our foreign currency risk management objective is
to protect cash flows resulting from sales, purchases and other
costs from the impact of exchange rate movements. The Company
manages a portion of these exposures with short-term strategies
after giving consideration to market conditions, contractual
agreements, anticipated sale and purchase transactions, and
other factors. Firmly committed and anticipated transactions and
the related receivables and payables may be hedged with forward
exchange contracts or purchased options. Premiums paid on
purchased options are included in prepaid expenses and are
recognized in earnings ratably over the life of the option.
Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and
purchased option contracts, and cross-currency swap transactions
are recognized in cost of goods sold or selling, general and
administrative expenses as offsets of gains and losses resulting
from the underlying hedged transactions. Hedge effectiveness is
determined by evaluating whether gains and losses on hedges will
offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures. This
evaluation is performed at inception of the hedge and
periodically over the life of the hedge. At December31, 2001 and 2000, the Company
had approximately $53,974,000 and $47,201,000 notionalin
forward exchange contracts. The net derivative gain
lossincluded in the Companys liabilities and
deferred in other comprehensive income was $844,000 and
$1,615,000 at December31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The counterparties to derivative transactions are
major financial institutions with high investment grade credit
ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Companys
exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit
risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such
contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as
contracted and is immaterial to any one institution at
December31, 2001 and 2000. To manage this risk, the
Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines,
which are continually monitored and reported to Senior
Management according to prescribed guidelines. As a result, the
Company considers the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. 39 Table of Contents COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
