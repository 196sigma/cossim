35 Table of Contents We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our consolidated
financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of
future performance. The operating results of many software
companies reflect seasonal trends, and our business, financial
condition and results of operations may be affected by such
trends in the future. These trends may include higher revenues
in the fourth quarter as many customers complete annual
budgetary cycles and lower revenues in the first quarter and
summer months when many businesses experience lower sales,
particularly in the European market. The consolidated financial statements required by this item are
submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report on
Form10-K. See .

Controls and Procedures Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form10-K are
certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, which are required in accordance with
Rule13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. This section includes information concerning our
internal control over financial reporting and the evaluations
referred to in those certifications.  of this Annual
Report on Form10-K sets forth the report of KPMG LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, regarding its
audit of our internal control over financial reporting and of
managements assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting set forth below in this section. This
section should be read in conjunction with the certifications
and the report of KPMG LLP for a more complete understanding of
the topics presented. Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation as of December31, 2004, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended were sufficiently effective to ensure
that the information required to be disclosed in this Annual
Report on Form10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commissions rules and instructions for
Form10-K. There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2004 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect our internal control over financial reporting. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will
prevent all errors or fraud. An internal control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of
fraud, if any, within Interwoven, Inc. have been detected. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over our financial reporting as
defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. Management assessed the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring 36 Table of Contents Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
framework, management has concluded that our internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December31,
2004. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG
LLP, has issued an audit report on its assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting, which is included
herein. Item 9B.Other
Information None. PARTIII Certain information required by PartIII is omitted from
this Annual Report on Form10-K since we will file a

Stockholders to be held on June2, 2005, pursuant to
