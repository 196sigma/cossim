NOTE 1. BACKGROUND
On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark Corporation Kimberly-Clark
distributed all of the outstanding common stock of Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc. the Distribution to its stockholders, through a tax-free
spin-off of its U.S., French and Canadian business operations that manufacture
and sell tobacco-related papers and other specialty paper products the
Businesses. Effective at the close of business on November 30, 1995, the
Company became an independent, publicly owned company as a result of the
Distribution.
In order to effectuate the spin-off of the Businesses, on August 21, 1995
and July 31, 1995, respectively, Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. SWM
and Schweitzer-Mauduit Canada, Inc. SM-Canada were incorporated and
nominally capitalized. Prior to the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark transferred to
SWM the Transfer i the assets and liabilities of its U.S.-based specialty
products business; ii all of the issued and outstanding shares of SM-Canada
and of Schweitzer-Mauduit France, S.A.R.L., a French corporation SMF; and
iii 72 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of LTR Industries, S.A., a
French corporation LTRI. After the Transfer, the Company consisted of the
operating assets and liabilities of Kimberly-Clark U.S. specialty products
business and investments in SM-Canada 100 percent owned, SMF 100 percent
owned and LTRI 72 percent owned. SMF, directly or indirectly, then owned 100
percent of two principal French operating subsidiaries, Papeteries de Mauduit
S.A. PdM and Papeteries de Malaucene S.A. PdMal, and a French holding
company, Schweitzer-Mauduit Enterprises S.A. SM-Enterprises. The Transfer
was accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that in pooling of
interests accounting as the entities were all under common control. As used
herein, the Company means SWM, SWM and its several subsidiaries or, as
determined by the context, one or more or its several subsidiaries.
During 1997, the Company established and nominally capitalized
Schweitzer-Mauduit Spain, S.L. SM-Spain, a 100 percent owned holding company
organized under the Spanish holding company regime.
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS
On February 2, 1998, SM-Spain paid approximately $620 in cash for 9997
percent ownership interest in Companhia Industrial de Papel Pirahy Pirahy, a
specialty paper manufacturer located near Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In connection
with the acquisition of Pirahy, the Company modified its existing credit
agreement to provide a $200 term loan to SM-Spain. SM-Spain borrowed the
remaining funds for the transaction from SMF, which in turn utilized its
existing cash balances and borrowings from its revolving credit facilities.
Subsequently, Pirahy was renamed Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil, S.A. SWM-B.
On February 11, 1998, SM-Enterprises paid 372 million French francs
approximately $61 in cash and assumed approximately $58 in existing net debt
for all of the outstanding shares of Ingefico, S.A. and 971 percent of the
outstanding shares of its pulp and specialty paper manufacturing subsidiaries,
Groupe SAPAM S.A. Groupe SAPAM and Papeteries de la Moulasse S.A., located
in St. Girons, France. Subsequently, SM-Enterprises acquired all the remaining
shares of Groupe SAPAM for $02 in cash. SM-Enterprises and Ingefico, S.A. were
then merged into Groupe SAPAM. Papeteries de la Moulasse S.A. was renamed
Papeteries de St. Girons S.A. PdStG.

The above acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities have been
recorded at their estimated fair values as of the respective dates of the
acquisitions. In conjunction with the acquisitions, liabilities were assumed as
follows:
Fair value of assets  $ 957
Less: Cash paid for the   683
Direct costs   20
Liabilities  $ 254
The operating results of the newly-acquired companies are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Income beginning February 1, 1998. Unaudited
consolidated pro forma net sales, net income, basic earnings per share and
diluted earnings per share, assuming the acquisitions had occurred at the
beginning of 1997, would have been $5704, $442, $276 and $271, respectively.
Unaudited consolidated pro forma net sales and net income for 1998 would have
been $5559 and $311, respectively. Unaudited consolidated pro forma basic and
diluted earnings per share for 1998 would have been $194 and $192, the same as
the Company audited consolidated basic and diluted earnings per share.
NOTE 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
amounts of revenues and expenses reported for the periods. Actual results could
differ from these estimates. These financial statements are presented on a
consolidated basis and include the accounts of SWM and all its majority-owned
subsidiaries. All material intercompany and interdivisional transactions are
eliminated.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are generally recognized upon shipment of the product to the
customer.
Foreign Currency Translation
The income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars
at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods. The balance sheets of
these entities are translated at period-end exchange rates, and the differences
from historical exchange rates are reflected in a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income as unrealized foreign currency
translation adjustments. Foreign currency gains and losses arising from
settlement of transactions in non-local currencies and remeasurement of
non-local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in
other income, net.
Earnings Per Share
Basic net income per common share is computed based on net income divided
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The average number
of common shares used in the calculation of basic net income per common share
for 1998, 1997 and 1996 were 16,018,700, 16,059,900 and 16,052,100,
respectively. Diluted net income per common share is computed based on net
income divided by the weighted average number of common and potential common
shares outstanding. The average number of common and potential common shares
used in the calculation of diluted net income per common share for 1998, 1997
and 1996 were 16,161,300, 16,338,600 and 16,216,900, respectively. The only
potential common shares are those related to stock options outstanding during
the respective years.

U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash, time deposits, and readily
marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less. The
recorded amount reported in the balance sheet approximates fair value.
Inventories
Most U.S. inventories are valued at cost on the Last-In, First-Out LIFO
method. The balance of the U.S. inventories and inventories of entities outside
the U.S. are valued at the lower of cost, using the First-In, First-Out FIFO
and weighted average methods, or market.
Property and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciable property is
depreciated on the straight-line method for accounting purposes. When property
is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet, and any gain or loss on the
transaction is included in income. The depreciable lives for the principal asset
categories are as follows:
ASSET CATEGORY                      DEPRECIABLE LIFE
-                                                  
Machinery and  5 to 20 years
20 to 40 years
Building  Lesser of 20 years or
remaining life of the
relevant building or
lease
Capitalized Software Costs
The Company accounts for costs incurred in connection with software
developed for internal use in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use issued in March 1998 by the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The Company
capitalizes certain purchases of software and software design and installation
costs in connection with major projects for software development for internal
use. These costs are included in Deferred Charges and Other Assets on the
consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on the straight line method for
accounting purposes over the estimated useful life not to exceed seven years.
Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user training, system
start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Environmental Spending
Environmental spending is capitalized if such spending qualifies as
property, plant and equipment, substantially increases the economic value or
extends the useful life of an asset. All other such spending is expensed as
incurred. Environmental spending relating to an existing condition caused by
past operations is expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental
assessments or remedial efforts are probable, and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a
feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action.
Impairment of Assets
The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of
long-lived assets based on its expectation of future profitability and
undiscounted cash flow of the related operations. These factors, along
37
38
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
with management plans with respect to the operations, are considered in
assessing the recoverability of property and purchased intangibles.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes have been
provided on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities by applying enacted tax rates in effect for the years in
which the differences are expected to reverse.
In France, prior to the Distribution, SMF, PdM, PdMal and SMF other
French subsidiaries unrelated to the tobacco-related and specialty papers
businesses were included in the consolidated income tax group of SMF, while LTRI
separately filed its own income tax returns. Those other SMF subsidiaries were
merged together, and the shares of the merged entity were distributed to
Kimberly-Clark prior to the Distribution. SMF remained part of SWM to permit PdM
and PdMal to utilize income tax loss carryforwards previously generated by those
other French operations. Subsequent to the Distribution, those other French
subsidiaries were no longer included in the consolidated income tax group of
SMF, and LTRI continues to separately file its own income tax returns.
Stock Compensation
Compensation cost for stock options is measured based on the intrinsic
value method under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees See
Note 8. Payments in the form of shares of the Company made to third parties,
including the Company outside Directors, are recorded at fair value based on
the market value of the Company common stock at the time of payment.
New Accounting Standard
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which will require that all derivative
financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet. SFAS No. 133 will be effective no later than for the Company
first quarter of 2000. The Company is evaluating the effects of this new
statement and when to implement the new requirements.

NOTE 5. DEBT
In 1995, the Company, SMF and PdM Industries S.N.C. PdM Industries, a
subsidiary owned 99 percent by PdM and one percent by SMF, entered into an
unsecured credit agreement the Credit Agreement with a group of banks to
provide term and revolving loans totaling 375 million French francs or
approximately $67 at December 31, 1998 and $63 at December 31, 1997 to SMF and
PdM Industries the French Credit Facility and term and revolving loans
totaling $400 to the Company the U.S. Credit Facility and, together with the
French Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities. The French Credit Facility
consists of a term loan to SMF in the amount of 250 million French francs or
approximately $45 at December 31, 1998 and $42 at December 31, 1997 the
French Term Loan Facility and a renewable 364-day revolving credit facility
available to both SMF and PdM Industries in an amount of up to 125 million
French francs or approximately $22 at December 31, 1998 and $21 at December 31,
1997 the French Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the French
Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company. The U.S. Credit Facility consists
of a term loan to the Company in the amount of $250 the U.S. Term Loan
Facility, and, together with the French Term Loan Facility, the Term Loan
Facilities and a renewable 364-day revolving credit facility available to the
Company in an amount of up to $150 the U.S. Revolving Credit Facility and,
together with the French Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit
Facilities. In connection with the Distribution, the Company made cash
distributions to Kimberly-Clark

principally financed by borrowings of the full amounts by SWM and SMF under the
U.S. and French Term Loan Facilities, respectively.
In February 1998, the Company completed the Brazilian and French
acquisitions see Note 2. In anticipation of these acquisitions, the Company
modified its then existing Credit Agreement. The terms of the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement entered into on January 30, 1998 were substantially
the same as the prior Credit Agreement, except that it i provided an
additional $200 term loan to SM-Spain adding it to the Term Loan Facilities,
ii extended the maturities of the Term Loan Facilities by approximately two
years, and iii renewed the Revolving Credit Facilities. During January 1999,
the Revolving Credit Facilities were renewed with an expiration date of January
28, 2000. Loans under each of the Term Loan Facilities are payable in three
equal semi-annual installments beginning in January 2002.
The interest rates under the Term Loan Facilities are based, at the
election of the Company, on either a the sum of i either 0375 percent per
annum or 0300 percent per annum the Applicable Margin, determined by
reference to the Company Leverage Ratio as defined in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement plus ii the London interbank offered rate
LIBOR, or b an alternate base rate. Beginning January 29, 1999, the
interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facilities are based, at the election
of the Company, on either a the sum of i 045 percent per annum plus ii
LIBOR, or b an alternate base rate.
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains representations and
warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and covenants and
provisions that, among other things, require the Company maintain certain
defined financial ratios a minimum Tangible Net Worth, a maximum Leverage Ratio
and a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, all as defined in the Amended and
Restated Credit Agreement. Events of default under the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement include, among other things, termination of the Company
supply agreement with Philip Morris without entry into one or more suitable
replacement agreements.
The Company selectively enters into interest rate hedge agreements with
respect to its variable rate long-term borrowings under the Credit Facilities to
manage its exposure to interest rate increases when it is practical and cost
effective to do so. The weighted average effective interest rates on the Term
Loan Facilities for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were 51
percent, 47 percent and 52 percent, respectively.
At both December 31, 1998 and 1997, long-term debt other than the Term Loan
Facilities primarily consisted of obligations of the French operations related
to government mandated profit sharing. These amounts bear interest at the five
year treasury note rate in France 60 percent at both December 31, 1998 and
1997 and are generally payable in the fifth year subsequent to the year the
profit sharing is accrued.

At December 31, 1998, the U.S. and the French operations of the Company
together had approximately $37 of Revolving Credit Facilities available, of
which approximately $26 was unused. These facilities permit borrowing at
competitive interest rates and are available for general corporate purposes.
Beginning January 29, 1999, the Company pays commitment fees on the unused
portion of these Revolving Credit Facilities at an annual rate of 15 percent
and may cancel the facilities without penalty at any time prior to their
expiration at January 28, 2000.
The Company also had other bank credit facilities available totaling
approximately $19, of which $03 was outstanding at December 31, 1998. No
commitment fees are paid on the unused portion of these facilities.
At December 31, 1998 and 1997, the estimated fair value of the Company
long-term debt and short-term debt approximated the carrying amount. These fair
values were based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt or on
current rates offered to the Company for obligations with the same maturities.

Provision for income taxes. $173   321%  $286   360%  $260   372%
The provision for income taxes in 1998 included the benefit of a reduction
in the valuation allowance recorded against certain French deferred income tax
assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards NOLs. This adjustment
reduced the deferred provision for income taxes by $52. The reduction in the
valuation allowance was recorded because of continued earnings and projected
future earnings at the French businesses that utilize the NOLs, reducing the
uncertainty that these NOLs will be fully utilized in the future.
The provision for income taxes in 1997 was impacted by an increase in the
effective statutory income tax rate enacted in France in November 1997 from
3667 percent to 4167 percent for 1997 and 1998, retroactive to January 1,
1997, and to 400 percent for 1999. The unfavorable effect on current taxes of
the tax rate increase, including a retroactive adjustment for the eleven-month
period ended November 30, 1997, was offset by the favorable effect on the
deferred provision for income taxes due to the increased value of the tax
benefits to be recognized from the NOLs retained by SMF estimated to be realized
during 1997, 1998 and 1999, the periods of the higher income tax rates. The
impact in 1997 attributable to deferred tax assets, net of liabilities, was a
favorable $20 on the deferred provision for income taxes. Also impacting the
1997 provision for income taxes was the enactment in France in 1997 of a law
that eliminated taxation of a provision for the fluctuating value of raw
materials that had been included in French deferred taxes. Cancellation of this
deferred tax liability reduced the provision for income taxes by $21.
The Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or plans to repatriate such earnings
only when tax effective to do so. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and
state income taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in
the form of dividends, loans to the U.S. parent, or otherwise, the Company could
be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax
credits and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. Determination
of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practicable
because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

Amount at December 31, 1998. $1658   $609  $128  $481
Under current tax laws governing the tax jurisdictions in which the Company
has NOLs, certain NOLs in France expire five years subsequent to the year
generated while others carry forward indefinitely, NOLs in Brazil carry forward
indefinitely and NOLs in Spain expire seven years subsequent to the year
generated. Of the $1658 of NOLs still available at December 31, 1998, $286 and
$25 will expire in 1999 and 2005, respectively, if not utilized against taxable
income of the respective jurisdiction. The remaining $1347 of NOLs have no
expiration date. The Company intends to elect to include newly-acquired PdStG in
the SMF consolidated tax group beginning January 1, 1999. After the 1998
adjustment of the French valuation allowance, establishment of a valuation
allowance to reduce the noncurrent deferred income tax asset related to the
Spanish NOLs and currency exchange rate changes during the year, valuation
allowances totaled $128 as of December 31, 1998, reducing the related net
deferred tax asset to an amount which is estimated to be realized through
utilization of the NOLs prior to their expiration. Although realization is not
assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred
tax asset will be realized. However, that amount could change if, among other
considerations, estimates of future taxable income, or income tax regulations or
interpretations, change during the carryforward periods.
Along with numerous other companies and banks in France, PdM is subject to
a tax claim with respect to its purchase of certain bonds in 1988 which were
represented by the two selling banks as carrying specific tax benefits. The
French taxing authority is challenging the use by PdM of those benefits. The tax
claim against PdM by the French taxing authority is $19 as of December 31,
1998, including penalties for abuse of the law and late payment. A court
decision has held that another purchaser of the bonds was not liable for abuse
of the law, thus eliminating the abuse of law portion of the claim. The
amount of penalties related to abuse of the law included in the tax claim
against PdM is approximately $08. If the same decision were applied to the tax
claim against PdM, PdM exposure as of December 31, 1998 would be reduced to
approximately $11. The Company is vigorously defending the claim based on the
merits and has filed claims against each bank on the basis of their
misrepresentation of certain facts. The Company claim against one of the banks
was rejected by a trial court in 1996 and the Company appealed this decision. In
1997, the case against the other bank was stayed until the claim filed by the
French taxing authority against PdM has been resolved. A reserve of $10 was
established for this tax claim against PdM during 1997. Based on information
45

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED

currently available, there exists a reasonable possibility of an unfavorable
outcome for this claim. Since the claim relates to a period prior to PdM joining
the consolidated tax group, any unfavorable outcome could not be offset with the
NOLs of the SMF consolidated tax group.
NOTE 7. POSTRETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS
North American Pension Benefits
In connection with the Distribution, retirees of the Company U.S. and
Canadian businesses prior to the Distribution remained participants of their
respective Kimberly-Clark plans. Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company and
its subsidiary in Canada established defined benefit retirement plans covering
substantially all full-time employees. Retirement benefits are based on years of
service and generally on the average compensation earned in the highest five of
the last 15 years of service. Employees as of the date of the Distribution
retained credit for prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark. The
Company funding policy is to contribute assets that, at a minimum, fully fund
the accumulated benefit obligation, subject to regulatory and tax deductibility
limits. Under the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark was required to transfer a
proportionate share of assets of its plans related to the employees who
transferred to the Company in the Distribution. The plan assets for the U.S. and
Canadian plans were transferred during 1997 from the Kimberly-Clark plans, in
which the employees had participated prior to the Distribution, to the Company
plans upon receiving favorable determination letters from the Internal Revenue
Service and Revenue Canada, respectively, qualifying the Company plans. Plan
assets are invested in a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of equity
and debt securities.
The components of net pension expense for U.S. employees for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were as follows:
1998  1997  1996
Service  $ 23  $ 21  $ 23

The assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets for purposes of
pension expense recognition for the U.S. employee plans was 100 percent for
each of the years 1998, 1997, and 1996. Transition adjustments for these plans
are being amortized on the straight-line method over 14 to 18 years. The
discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation and
accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. employee pension plans were 675
percent and 725 percent at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The
assumed long-term rates of compensation increases used to determine the
projected benefit obligations for these plans were 40 percent for both December
31, 1998 and 1997.

and $26 and $14, respectively, as of December 31, 1997. This particular plan
is unfunded and therefore has no plan assets.
French Pension Benefits
In France, employees are covered under a government administered program.
In addition, the Company French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans
which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to employees who retire from the
Company. The Company French operations also sponsor a supplemental executive
pension plan which is designed to provide a retirement benefit equal to between
50 and 65 percent of final earnings, depending upon years of service, after
considering other government and Company sponsored retirement plans. Plan assets
are principally invested in the general asset portfolio of a French insurance
company.
The Company net pension expense for the French pension plans was $16 11 and $10 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. The assumed long-term rates of return on pension assets for
purposes of pension expense recognition for the French plans were 70 percent
for 1998 and 80 percent for 1997 and 1996. Transition adjustments for these
plans are being amortized on the straight-line method over 19 to 20 years. The
discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation and
accumulated benefit obligation for the French plans were 60 percent and 80
percent at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The assumed long-term rates
of compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligation for
these plans were approximately 25 percent and 40 percent at December 31, 1998
and 1997, respectively.
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value of plan assets for the French pension plans were $154, $80 and $40,
respectively, as of December 31, 1998, and $103, $44 and

liability for the French plans was $45 and $17 at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.
Brazilian Pension Benefits
In Brazil, employees are covered under a government administered program.
Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits
In connection with the Distribution, retirees of the Company U.S. and
Canadian businesses prior to the Distribution remained participants of their
respective Kimberly-Clark plans. Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company and
its subsidiary in Canada established unfunded health care and life insurance
benefit plans which will cover substantially all future retirees of the Company.
Eligibility for benefits under the Company plans is based on years of service
and age at retirement. Employees as of the date of the Distribution retained
credit for prior service while employees of Kimberly-Clark. The Company plans
are noncontributory for certain long service employees when they retire, but are
contributory for most other future retirees.
The components of U.S. employee postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit costs were as follows for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996:

obligation at December 31, 1997, a 775 percent annual increase in the per
capita cost of health care benefits was assumed for 1998. The rate was assumed
to decrease to 55 percent in 2000 and remain at that level thereafter. Discount
rates of 675 percent and 725 percent were used to determine the postretirement
benefit obligations at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
A one-percentage point increase or decrease in the healthcare cost trend
rate would have a nominal effect on the total of the service and interest cost
components of the postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1998. A one
percentage point increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the
total postretirement benefit obligation by $01 at December 31, 1998. Likewise,
a one percentage point decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate would decrease
the total postretirement benefit obligation by $01 at December 31, 1998.
Other Benefits
Substantially all U.S. employees have been given the opportunity to
participate in voluntary investment plans. Under the plans, the Company matches
a portion of employee contributions. The Company cost under the plans
reflected in each of the accompanying consolidated income statements for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $10. At December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, 500,000 shares of the Company Common Stock were reserved for
issuance under these plans, none of which had been issued as of December 31,
1998. The shares may, at the Company option, be used by the Company to satisfy
the Company liability for its matching contributions.
NOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Company Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to
100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $10 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock, par value $10 per share. Each share of presently
outstanding Common Stock and each share of Common Stock issued after the date of
this report will have attached to it, one right to purchase from the Company one
one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of a series of Preferred Stock designated as
the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock the Series A Preferred
Stock a Right. Each Right entitles a shareholder to purchase from the
Company one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock at
a price of $65 per one one-hundredth 1/100 of a share, subject to certain
anti-dilution adjustments. The Rights, however, become exercisable only at such
time as a person or group acquires, or commences a public tender or exchange
offer for, 15 percent or more of the Company Common Stock. The Rights have
certain anti-takeover effects since they may cause substantial dilution to a
person or group that attempts to acquire the Company on terms not approved by
the Company Board of Directors. The Rights should not interfere with any
merger or other business combination approved by the Board of Directors since
they may be redeemed by the Company at $01 per Right at any time until a person
or group has obtained beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting
stock. The Rights will expire at the close of business on October 1, 2005,
unless redeemed earlier by the Company.
The Series A Preferred Stock will be non-redeemable and, unless otherwise
provided in connection with the creation of a subsequent series of preferred
stock, will be subordinate to any other series of the Company preferred stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive when, as and
if declared, a quarterly dividend in an amount equal to the greater of $1 per
share or 100 times the cash dividends declared on the Company Common Stock. In
addition, the Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to 100 times any non-cash
dividends other than dividends payable in shares of Common Stock or a
subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock declared on the Common
Stock, in like kind. In the event of a liquidation, the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a liquidation payment in an amount
equal to the greater of $100 per share or 100 times the payment made per share
of Common Stock. Each share of
49

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
Series A Preferred Stock will have 100 votes, voting together with the Common
Stock. In the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which
common shares are exchanged, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be
entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per share of Common Stock. The
rights of the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends, liquidation and voting
are protected by antidilution provisions.
The Company Equity Participation Plan the Plan provides that eligible
employees may be granted stock options which, when exercised, give the recipient
the right to purchase the Company Common Stock at a price no less than the
fair market value as defined in the Plan of such stock at grant date.
Options awarded under the Plan only become exercisable after specified periods
of employment after the grant thereof 30 percent after the first year, 30
percent after the second year and the remaining 40 percent after the third
year. Generally, such options expire ten years subsequent to the date of grant.
SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation defines a fair value
based method of accounting for stock compensation, including stock options, to
employees. This statement provides entities a choice of recognizing related
compensation expense by adopting the fair value method or to measure
compensation using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25. The Company has elected to continue to measure
compensation cost for stock options based on the intrinsic value method under
APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Payments in the form of
shares of the Company made to third parties, including the Company outside
Directors, are recorded at fair value based on the market value of the Company
common stock at the time of payment. Under APB No. 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
SFAS No. 123 requires presentation of pro forma net income and earnings per
share as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the
fair value method of that statement. For purposes of the pro forma disclosures,
the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the vesting
period. Under the fair value method, the Company net income and earnings per
share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below:
1998  1997  1996
Net Income:
As  $310  $453  $387
Pro  $298  $443  $374
Basic net income per share:
As  $194  $282  $241
Pro  $186  $276  $233
Diluted net income per share:
As  $192  $277  $238
Pro  $184  $271  $231
The valuation under SFAS No. 123 was based on the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the market value of the stock equal to the exercise price, an
estimated volatility over the ten year option term of 24 percent for the 1998
awards, 30 percent for the 1997 awards and 32 percent for the 1996 awards, a
risk-free rate of return based upon the zero coupon government bond yield, and
an assumed quarterly dividend of $015 per share. At both December 31, 1998 and
1997, 1,500,000 shares of the Company Common Stock were reserved under the
Plan. At December 31, 1998 and 1997, there were 608,040 and 724,000 shares
available for future awards.

NOTE 9. FOREIGN CURRENCY
Foreign currency losses have arisen from settlement of transactions in
non-local currencies and the remeasurement of non-local currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities into the currency of the country in which the
operation is domiciled. Such losses included in other income, net were nominal
in 1998, 1997 and 1996.
Foreign currency risks arise from transactions and commitments denominated
in non-local currencies. These transactions and commitments may include the
purchase of inventories or property, plant and equipment, the sale of products
and the repayment of loans.
Management selectively hedges the Company foreign currency risks when it
is practical and cost effective to do so. The instruments are purchased from
well-known money center banks, insurance companies or government agencies
counterparties. Usually the contracts extend for no more than 12 months,
although their contractual term has been as long as 18 months. Credit risks with
respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be
hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the
contracts, are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties.
Gains and losses on instruments that hedge firm commitments are deferred
and included in the basis of the underlying hedged items. Premiums paid for
options are amortized ratably over the life of the option. All other gains and
losses are included in period income or expense based on the period-end market
price of the instrument.

At December 31, 1998, there were outstanding forward contracts, which were
held for purposes other than trading, maturing at various dates in 1999, to
purchase $40 of various foreign currencies. These contracts have not given rise
to any significant net deferred gains or losses as of December 31, 1998.
NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS
Operating Leases
Future minimum obligations under non-cancelable operating leases having an
initial or remaining term in excess of one year as of December 31, 1998 are less
than $1 annually over the next five years. Rental expense under operating leases
was $51, $40 and $39 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
Other Commitments
During 1998, PdM entered into a ten year agreement with one of its vendors
in connection with PdM purchases of calcium carbonate, a raw material used in
the manufacturing of some paper products. The vendor has agreed to construct and
operate an on-site plant at the Quimperle, France mill. The cost to construct
the necessary building and equipment will be approximately $7. PdM has agreed to
annual minimum purchase commitments at prices which will vary according to
quantities consumed. If PdM buys less than the minimum purchase commitments, the
vendor can terminate the contract and require PdM to pay to the vendor the then
net book value of the building and equipment, determined using a straight-line
method of depreciation over the life of the agreement.
Similarly, a vendor of SWM-B operates a calcium carbonate plant on-site at
the Pirahy, Brazil mill. Under that agreement, which will expire in 2006, the
net raw material prices vary according to the quantities produced, however,
SWM-B is committed to pay at least the monthly fixed costs of the calcium
carbonate plant which are less than $01 per month.
Under each of the above agreements, the net raw material prices expected to
be paid are less than the net prices at which the raw material could otherwise
be purchased, and thus the commitments are not expected to result in losses.
Additionally, PdM and SWM-B current levels of calcium carbonate usage far
exceed their respective contractual minimum commitments.
The Company has entered into certain other contracts for the purchase of
certain raw materials. Minimum purchase commitments, at current prices, are
approximately $07 in 1999. These purchase commitments are not expected to
result in losses.
The Company has also entered into certain contracts for the purchase of
equipment and related costs in connection with its ongoing capital projects.
These commitments at December 31, 1998 totaled approximately $86.
SWM-B has arrangements with local financial institutions through which
certain customers selected by SWM-B that desire extended payment terms can
obtain financing directly with such financial institutions. SWM-B negotiates the
terms of the financing and, upon agreement by all parties, SWM-B receives
immediate payment from the financial institution upon the sale of the related
product. Under these arrangements, SWM-B retains an unrecorded commitment to the
financial institutions in the event the customer defaults. SWM-B has total
arrangements available as of December 31, 1998 of approximately $91, of which
approximately $27 was being utilized.

NOTE 11. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Under the terms of the Distribution, the Company assumed liability for and
agreed to indemnify Kimberly-Clark from litigation arising out of the operation
of the Businesses, including the following cases:
- A purported class action, defining a class of plaintiffs who allegedly
sustained injuries as a result of being exposed to tobacco smoke and
respirable asbestos fibers, and three individual actions have been filed
in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia in 1998 against
several tobacco companies, tobacco industry trade associations and
consultants, tobacco wholesalers and cigarette component manufacturers,
including Kimberly-Clark and LTRI. The class representative and each
individual plaintiff, respectively, seek compensatory damages of $2 to
$3, punitive damages of $3 and, for class members, compensatory and
punitive damages in an unspecified amount. Cleo Huffman, Denny L.
Parsons, Linda Morris and Sinette Newkirk, the named plaintiffs in these
actions, filed their respective complaints on February 13, 1998, February
27, 1998, March 13, 1998 and July 22, 1998. The complaints allege several
theories of liability against the defendants including negligence,
product liability, misrepresentation, breach of warranty, conspiracy and
other theories of liability. The Company has filed motions to dismiss
that are currently pending in each of these cases.
- In September 1998, Luanne Jividen and Jerry Jividen filed a complaint in
the Circuit Court of Mason County, West Virginia against several tobacco
companies, industry trade associations and consultants, tobacco
wholesalers and cigarette component manufacturers, including
Kimberly-Clark and LTRI, seeking equitable relief, $1 in compensatory
damages and $3 in punitive damages for mental suffering, physical injury
and loss of consortium allegedly sustained as a result of Ms. Jividen
contracting breast cancer as a result of her addiction to smoking
Marlboro and other brands of cigarettes. The fourteen count complaint
sets forth several theories of liability including willful and negligent
misrepresentation, violations of state consumer protection laws, breach
of express and implied warranties, intentional infliction of emotional
distress, product liability, conspiracy, sale of an unreasonably
dangerous product and accomplice liability.
- In October 1998, Edward J. Sweeney, Stephen R. Micarek and Lisa A. Figura
filed, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, on
behalf of themselves and certain residents of Pennsylvania, a purported
class action against several tobacco companies, industry trade
associations and consultants, tobacco wholesalers and retailers and
cigarette component manufacturers, including Kimberly-Clark, seeking
equitable relief and punitive damages for the class in an unspecified
amount. The class consists of those Pennsylvania residents who,
commencing before age 18... purchased, smoked... and continue to
smoke cigarettes manufactured, marketed and sold by defendants. The five
count complaint alleges that the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs
under a number of theories, including product liability, consumer fraud,
breach of special duty, negligence and civil conspiracy. Among other
things, the complaint alleges that nicotine is an addictive substance,
that the tobacco companies, by using reconstituted tobacco and other
additives, are able to control the precise amount and/or the
bioavailability of nicotine in their cigarettes and that LTRI, formerly a
subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark, specializes in the tobacco reconstitution
process and in helping tobacco companies control the nicotine in their
cigarettes. The defendants have sought to remove the case to the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Plaintiff
motion to remand the case to state court is pending.
As a component supplier, the Company believes that Kimberly-Clark has
meritorious defenses to each of these cases. LTRI also has meritorious defenses
to each of the cases in which it has been named as a defendant and will seek to
be dismissed from such actions on the grounds that it is not subject to the
personal jurisdiction of the West Virginia courts and also on the grounds that
it did not sell its products in the United States. Due to the uncertainties of
litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these cases and is
53
54
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss which could
result from an unfavorable outcome of these actions. These cases will be
vigorously defended.
During 1998, Kimberly-Clark was voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice, from
a purported tobacco class action brought by James E. McCune in 1997 in the
Circuit Court of Kanawha County, West Virginia, and, in December 1998, the
federal district court in Utah dismissed Kimberly-Clark, with prejudice, from a
tobacco class action brought by three union health and welfare funds.
Also, the Company is involved in certain other legal actions and claims
arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that such
litigation and claims will be resolved without a material effect on the
Company consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 12. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company operations are subject to federal, state and local laws,
regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental matters. The nature
of the Company operations expose it to the risk of claims with respect to
environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or
liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. Based on the
Company experience to date, the Company believes that its future cost of
compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure
to liability for environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company financial condition or results of operations. However, future
events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown
contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company
including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or
other waste generators may give rise to additional costs which could have a
material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or results of
operations.
Prior to the Distribution, Kimberly-Clark was named a potentially
responsible party PRP under the provisions of the U.S. Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA, or analogous
state statutes, in connection with two waste disposal sites utilized by the
Company Spotswood, New Jersey mill. Prior to the Distribution, the Spotswood
mill also responded to an information request by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection and Energy NJDEP with respect to another landfill
site allegedly used by the Spotswood mill. The Company has assumed
Kimberly-Clark liabilities at each of these sites but does not believe that
any of these proceedings will result in the imposition of monetary sanctions or
have a material adverse effect on the Company business or financial condition.
The Company also assumed responsibility to administer a consent order
between Kimberly-Clark and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection MDEP governing the post-closure care of the Willow Hill Landfill
in Lee, Massachusetts. The Company is obligated to maintain the integrity of the
cover and to sample groundwater by means of monitoring wells, in addition to
other long-term maintenance responsibilities for this former non-hazardous waste
disposal facility. Under the terms of a January 24, 1997 Administrative Consent
Order with MDEP, as amended Consent Order, the Company was required to
reduce concentrations of landfill gases at the landfill property line to
specified levels by September 15, 1998. The Company has met the specified levels
at 22 of 26 gas monitoring wells, but four monitoring wells have not yet
attained such levels at 30 feet below ground level. Since such noncompliance
does not create a safety risk, the Company has applied to MDEP to modify the
Consent Order so that gas concentration measurements are restricted to 20 feet
below ground level and monitoring frequency is reduced to twice per month.
Pending a decision on the Company request to modify the Consent Order, the
Company must continue to monitor gas concentrations at the property line as
specified in the Consent Order. Although the literal terms of the Consent Order
could subject the Company to penalties for failing to meet the September 15,
1998 deadline, the Company does not expect the imposition of penalties based on
the absence of a safety risk and current progress toward full compliance. The
estimated cost of the remaining corrective action and annual operating expenses
54
55
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
U.S. $ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
expected to be incurred under the Consent Order, without the modifications
requested by the Company, is $02, which amount has been accrued as of December
31, 1998.
On December 7, 1998, the Company Lee mills received a Notice of
Enforcement Conference concerning self-reported exceedances of its National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit limit on biological oxygen demand
BOD for four consecutive months June 1998 through September 1998. Company
representatives presented an action plan to MDEP that the Company believes will
prevent future exceedances of its BOD limits. MDEP proposed that the Company
enter into an Administrative Consent Order With Penalty that would detail the
corrective actions to be taken, a timeline for implementation and stipulated
penalties for any future, as well as past, violations. MDEP has proposed a total
penalty of fifteen thousand dollars for past exceedances of the BOD limits. The
Company does not believe that the cost of any corrective action or the amount of
any administrative penalties will have a material adverse effect on the
Company business or financial condition.
Certain of the Company facilities comprising the Lee mills and the
Spotswood mill were subject to Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
and were, therefore, required to apply for Operating Permits under that title.
The Columbia mill and the Niagara mill portions of the Lee mills received
final Title V Operating Permits on April 21, 1998 and May 4, 1998, respectively.
On February 4, 1999, the Spotswood mill filed an amended Operating Permit
Application in response to NJDEP Notice of Administrative Incompleteness
issued to the mill. No material capital expenditures or operating expenses are
expected to be incurred by the U.S. business as a result of this permitting
process.
The Company U.S. operations were not impacted by the first phase of the
revised U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA Cluster Rules.
Subsequent phases of the Cluster Rules could impact the Company U.S.
facilities; however, the potential impact cannot be estimated until after the
EPA proposes applicable requirements, if any.
The Company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and
otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at the Company
facilities in the United States, France, Brazil and Canada. For these purposes,
the Company incurred total capital expenditures of $17 in 1998, and anticipates
that it will incur approximately $2 to $4 annually in 1999 and 2000. The major
projects included in these estimates include upgrading wastewater treatment
facilities at various locations and installation of ink solvent treatment
equipment in France. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to
reduce the Company ability to invest in capacity expansion, quality
improvements, capital replacements, productivity improvements, or cost
containment projects, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Company financial condition or results of operations.
NOTE 13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHY
Business Segment Reporting
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. Information presented herein is in
accordance with this new disclosure standard and closely aligns with geographic
information presented by the Company in previous years.
The Company is operated and managed based on the geographical location of
its manufacturing operations: the U.S., France and Brazil. These business
segments manufacture and sell cigarette, tipping and plug wrap papers, used to
wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco products, and paper
products used in cigarette packaging, primarily to the tobacco industry. While
the products are comparable in each segment, they vary based on the
technological capabilities of each of the manufacturing operations and the
respective markets and customers served. Sales by a segment into markets
primarily served by a different

segment occur where specific product needs cannot be cost effectively met by the
manufacturing operations in that segment.
Tobacco industry products comprised 90 percent of the Company
consolidated net sales in 1998, and 94 percent in 1997 and 1996. The Company
non-tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products, certain of which
represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine operations.
Consolidated Operations by Segment
For purposes of the segment disclosure in the following tables, the term
United States includes operations in the U.S. and Canada. The Canadian
operations only produce flax fiber used as raw material in the U.S. operations.
The Company Brazilian operations acquired on February 2, 1998 and the
operations of the French business acquired on February 11, 1998 are included in
the Company consolidated financial statements since the beginning of February
1998.
Intercompany sales of products between segments are made at market prices
and are referred to as intersegment items. Expense amounts not associated with
segments are referred to as unallocated items. Assets reported by segment
represent assets which are directly used and an allocated portion of jointly
used assets. These assets include receivables from other segments and are
included in eliminations.

1 Substantially all of the Company net sales to Latin America were to
customers in Brazil in each of the periods presented.
NOTE 14. MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Two of the Company customers have accounted for a significant portion of
the Company net sales in one or more of the last several years, and the loss
of one or both such customers, or a significant reduction in one or both of
these customers' purchases, could have a material adverse effect on the
Company results of operations. Net sales to Philip Morris Incorporated
Philip Morris, together with its affiliates and designated converters,
accounted for approximately 28 percent, 36 percent and 35 percent, of total
consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. As a result of the acquisition of the Brazilian business in 1998,
a substantial portion of whose sales are to a subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries
PLC BAT, net sales to BAT, together with its affiliates and designated
converters, increased to approximately 14 percent of consolidated net sales for
the year ended December 31, 1998. For periods prior to 1998, BAT was a
significant customer, but accounted for less than ten percent of the Company
consolidated net sales. Each of the Company segments reported sales to these
customers for each of the respective periods reported above.
The Company had sales to the minority shareholder of LTRI of $168, $140
and $184 in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The Company consolidated accounts receivable at December 31, 1998 and
1997 included balances from Philip Morris and BAT, together with their
respective affiliates and designated converters. The percentage of these
customers' balances of consolidated accounts receivable is approximately the
same as their respective percentages of consolidated net sales. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations on all of its customers' financial condition
and generally does not require collateral or other security to support customer
receivables.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Schweitzer-Mauduit International,
Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity, and cash flow for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997
and 1996. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Schweitzer-Mauduit
International, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. is responsible for
conducting all aspects of the business, including the preparation of the
financial statements in this Annual Report. The financial statements have been
prepared using generally accepted accounting principles considered appropriate
in the circumstances to present fairly the Company consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows on a consistent basis. Management
also has prepared the other information in this Annual Report and is responsible
for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements.
As can be expected in a complex and dynamic business environment, some
financial statement amounts are based on management estimates and judgments.
Even though estimates and judgments are used, measures have been taken to
provide reasonable assurance of the integrity and reliability of the financial
information contained in this Annual Report. These measures include an effective
control-oriented environment in which a company-wide internal control program
plays an important role, an Audit Committee of the Board of Directors which
oversees the financial reporting process, and independent audits. As part of
that responsibility, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors
the selection of the Company independent public accountants, Deloitte & Touche
LLP.
One characteristic of a control-oriented environment is a system of
internal control over financial reporting and over safeguarding of assets
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition, designed to provide
reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding
preparation of reliable published financial statements and such asset
safeguarding. The system is supported with written policies and procedures and
contains self-monitoring mechanisms. Appropriate actions are taken by management
to correct deficiencies as they are identified. All internal control systems
have inherent limitations, including the possibility of circumvention and
overriding of controls, and therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance as
to financial statement preparation and such asset safeguarding. Management
believes the Company system of internal control maintains an appropriate
cost-benefit relationship.
The Company has also adopted a code of conduct which, among other things,
contains policies for conducting business affairs in a lawful and ethical manner
in each country in which it does business, for avoiding potential conflicts of
interest, and for preserving confidentiality of information and business ideas.
Internal controls have been implemented to provide reasonable assurance that the
code of conduct is followed.
The financial statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP. During
their audits, the independent auditors were given unrestricted access to all
financial records and related data. Management believes that all representations
made to the independent auditors during their audits were valid and appropriate.
During the audits conducted by the independent auditors, management
received minor recommendations to strengthen or modify internal controls in
response to developments and changes. Management has adopted, or is in the
process of adopting, all recommendations which are cost-effective.
