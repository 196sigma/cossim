Item5:
Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures As required by Rule13a-15b of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, FormFactor management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K, of the
effectiveness of FormFactors disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15e.
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that as of December27, 2003,
FormFactors disclosure controls and procedures were
effective for ensuring that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that FormFactor files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Internal Control over Financial
Reporting As required by Rule13a-15d of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, FormFactor management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, also conducted an evaluation of FormFactors
internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f to determine whether any
changes in FormFactors internal control over financial
reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of 2003 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, FormFactors internal control over financial
reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such
change during the fourth fiscal quarter. Limitations on Effectiveness of
Controls It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system
will be met. The design of any control system is based, in part,
upon the benefits of the control system relative to its costs.
Control systems can be circumvented by the individual acts of
some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the control. In addition, over time,
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In addition, the design of any control system is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events. 40 Table of Contents PARTIII
