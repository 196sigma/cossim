The accompanying notes are an integral part
of these consolidated financial statements. 38 RUSH ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION
AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises, Inc. the Company was incorporated in June 1996
under the laws of the State of Texas. The Company, founded in 1965, now
operates a Heavy-Duty Truck segment and a Construction Equipment segment. The
Heavy-Duty Truck segment operates a regional network of 38 truck centers that
provide an integrated one-stop source for the trucking needs of its customers,
including retail sales of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks; parts,
service and body shop facilities; and financial services, including assisting
in the financing of new and used truck purchases, insurance products and truck
leasing and rentals. The Companys truck centers are located in areas on or
near major highways in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The Construction Equipment segment, formed during
1997, operates a John Deere equipment center in Houston, Texas. A portion of
this segment, that operated five John Deere Equipment Centers in Michigan, was
discontinued during 2002 see Note 3. Dealership operations include the retail
sale of new and used equipment, aftermarket parts and service facilities,
equipment rentals and the financing of new and used equipment see Note 19. In February 2003, the Company acquired the common stock of Orange
County Truck and Trailers, Inc. Orange County, a Peterbilt dealer in
central Florida. The acquisition provided Rush with the right to sell Peterbilt
trucks and parts from three new locations in central Florida, including
Orlando, Haines City, and Tampa. The transaction was valued at approximately
$54 million, with the purchase price paid in cash. In April 2003, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of
Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc., which consisted of a dealership in Mobile, Alabama.
Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc.s primary line of business is the sale of new
Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks, parts and service. The transaction was
valued at approximately $14 million, with the purchase price paid in cash. As part of the Companys corporate reorganization in connection with
its initial public offering Offering in June 1996, the Company acquired, as
a wholly owned subsidiary, a managing general agent the MGA to manage all
of the operations of Associated Acceptance, Inc. AA. W. Marvin Rush, the
sole shareholder of AA, is prohibited from the sale or transfer of the capital
stock of AA under the MGA agreement, except as designated by the Company.
Therefore, the financial position and operations of AA have been included as
part of the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations
for all periods presented. Effective at the close of business on July 9, 2002 the Record Date,
pursuant to action taken by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting of the
Company held July 9, 2002, and described in the Proxy Statement dated May 15,
2002, the Board of Directors of the Company reclassified the outstanding common
stock, $001 par value per share the Old Common Stock, as Class B Common
Stock, $001 par value per share the Class B Common Stock, and declared a
stock dividend of one share of a new Class A Common Stock, $01 par value per
share the Class A Common Stock, for each share of Class B Common Stock held
by shareholders of record on the Record Date. Each share of Class A Common
Stock ranks substantially equal to each share of Class B Common Stock with
respect to receipt of any dividends or distributions declared on shares of
common stock and the right to receive proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of
the Company after payment of the Companys indebtedness and liquidation
preference payments to holders of preferred shares. However, holders of Class A
Common Stock have 1/20th of one vote per share on all matters
requiring a shareholder vote, while holders of Class B Common Stock have one
vote per share on all matters requiring a shareholder vote. The Companys stock
trades on The NASDAQ National Market under the
symbols RUSHA and RUSHB. Prior to the reclassification and stock dividend, the
Company had 7,002,044 shares of Old Common Stock outstanding. Additionally, all
stock option information in Note 13 has been adjusted to reflect the above
transaction for all periods presented. The adjustment caused each option
outstanding prior to July 9, 2002 to become an option to 39 purchase Class A Common Stock and an option to purchase Class B Common
Stock, each with an exercise price of 50% of the exercise price of the option
originally granted. All significant interdivision and intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period
balances have been reclassified for comparative purposes. 2. SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined
by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment
inventory and by the first-in, first-out method for tires, parts and
accessories. An allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will
exceed net realizable value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the
improvement, or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Provision for
depreciation of property and equipment is calculated primarily on a
straight-line basis. The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the
active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest,
when incurred, is added to the cost of underlying assets and is amortized over
the estimated useful life of such assets. The Company did not incur any
capitalized interest related to major capital projects in the periods
presented. The cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization and estimated useful
lives are summarized as follows in thousands

40 Allowance for Doubtful Receivables and Repossession Losses The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and
repossession losses after considering historical loss experience and other
factors that might affect the collection of accounts receivable and the ability
of customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the
Company. Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions of
approximately $425million as of December 31, 2003 and $436million
as of December 31, 2004. During 2003 and 2004, the Company acquired goodwill
related to acquisitions of $43 million and $11 million, respectively. Other
assets also include a long-term deferred tax asset of $04 million and notes
receivable of $10 million at December 31, 2004. The Company recognizes
interest income on notes receivable monthly as earned. Accumulated amortization
of other assets at December31, 2003 was approximately $46 million. At
December 31, 2004, accumulated amortization of other assets was approximately
$47 million. The Company annually assesses the appropriateness of the asset
valuations of other assets and the related amortization period as applicable. Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142, addresses financial accounting and
reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and supersedes APB
Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 addresses how intangible assets
that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those
acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial
statements upon their acquisition. SFAS 142 also addresses how goodwill and
other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially
recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of SFAS 142 became effective
January 1, 2002. The Company has completed its impairment review for goodwill
related to continuing operations at December 31, 2004 and recorded no
impairment charges in its financial statements. However, the Company is exposed
to the possibility that changes in market conditions could result in
significant impairment charges in the future, thus resulting in a potential
increase in earnings volatility. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS109.
SFAS109 requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in a
companys financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently
enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected
to reverse. Revenue Recognition Policies Income on the sale of vehicles and construction equipment
collectively, unit is recognized when the seller and customer execute a
purchase contract, delivery has occurred and there are no significant
uncertainties related to financing or collectibility. Finance income related to
the sale of a unit is recognized over the period of the respective finance
contract, based on the effective interest rate method, if the finance contract
is retained by the Company. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, no finance contracts
were retained for any significant length of time by the Company but were
generally sold, with limited recourse, to certain finance companies concurrent
with the sale of the related unit. Gain or loss is recognized by the Company
upon the sale of such finance contracts to the finance companies, net of a
provision for estimated repossession losses and early repayment penalties.
Lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or
rental agreement. Parts and services revenue is earned at the time the Company
sells the parts to its customers or at the time the Company completes the
service work order related to service provided to the customers unit. Payments
received on prepaid maintenance plans are deferred as a component of accrued
expenses and recognized as income when the maintenance is performed. 41 Cost of Sales For the Companys new and used truck and
construction equipment operations and its parts operations, cost of sales
consists primarily of the Companys actual purchase price, less manufacturers
incentives, for new and used trucks and construction equipment and parts. For
the Companys service and body shop operations, technician labor cost is the
primary component of cost of sales. For the Companys rental and leasing
operations, cost of sales consists primarily of depreciation and interest
expense on the portion of the lease and rental fleet owned by the Company, rent
and interest expense on the portion of the lease and rental fleet leased by the
Company, and the maintenance cost of the lease and rental fleet. There are no
costs of sales associated with the Companys finance and insurance revenue or
other revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of
incentive-based compensation for sales, finance and general management
personnel, salaries for administrative personnel and expenses for rent, marketing,
insurance, utilities, shipping and handling costs and other general operating
purposes. Stock Options In October 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS123, was
issued. SFAS123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for
employee stock options or similar equity instruments and encourages all
entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock
compensation plans. Under the fair value based method, compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized
over the service period of the award, which is usually the vesting period.
However, SFAS123 also allows entities to continue to measure compensation
costs for employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB25. Because the Company elected to continue to
follow APB 25, SFAS123 requires disclosure of pro forma net income and
earnings per share as if the new fair value accounting method were adopted. If the Company had adopted the fair value
accounting method under SFAS123, the Companys net income and earnings
per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below in
thousands, except per share amounts

option pricing model with a risk-free interest rate of 60%for 2002, a
range of 365% to 42% for 2003, and a range of 314% to 384% for 2004,
volatility factor range of 1792 to 1877 for 2002, a range of 433 to 471 for
2003, and a range of 299 to 499 for 2004, a dividend yield of 0%, and an
expected option life of seven years for 2002, 2003 and 2004. Advertising Costs The Company charges advertising costs to expense as incurred.
Advertising and marketing expense related to operations was $13 million for
fiscal year 2002, $14 million for fiscal year 2003, and $15 million for
fiscal year 2004. Advertising and marketing expense is included in selling,
general and administrative expense. Statement of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money
market instruments. The Company considers any temporary investments that mature
in three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents for reporting
cash flows. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In
January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities FIN 46, and in December 2003 issued a revised
interpretation FIN 46R. FIN 46 and FIN 46R address the accounting for, and
disclosure of, investments in variable interest entities. The Company adopted
FIN 46 and FIN 46R, which did not have a material impact on our financial
position or results of operations. In
April 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, Amendment
of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 149.
This statement amends SFAS 133 to provide clarification on the financial
accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and
requires contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a
comparable basis. The Company adopted SFAS 149 for all contracts entered into
or modified after June 30, 2003 and it did not have a material impact on our
financial condition or results of operations. On
May 15, 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity SFAS 150. The statement established standards for classifying and
measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations
of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150
must be applied immediately to instruments entered into or modified after May
31, 2003. The Company adopted SFAS 150 and it did not have a material impact on
our financial position or results of operations. On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R, which is a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS
123R supersedes APB 25 and
amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS
123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer
an alternative. SFAS 123R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early
adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not
yet been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS 123R on July 1, 2005. As currently permitted by SFAS 123, the Company accounts for
share-based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and
generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options.
Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123Rs fair value method will have a
significant impact on our result of operations, but it is not expected to have
a significant impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adopting
of SFAS 123R on our future results of operations cannot be predicted at this
time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the
future. However, had we adopted SFAS 123R in prior periods, the impact would
have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described 43 in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS 123R also requires the benefits
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as
a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under
current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and
increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption of SFAS 123R.
While the Company cannot accurately estimate what those amounts will be in the
future because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise
stock options, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods
for such excess tax deductions were $0 in 2003 and $34 million in 2004. 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On November 12, 2002, the Company announced that it would sell its
Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores as a result of continuing
deterioration in the Michigan construction equipment market and its location in
regards to the Companys other operations and its plans for future expansion.
The sale of the Michigan construction equipment stores was substantially
complete at December 31, 2002. Prior to the sale, the Michigan construction
equipment stores were part of the Companys Construction Equipment segment. The
Construction Equipment segment has been restated for all periods presented to
exclude the Michigan stores. On November 12, 2002 the Company decided to discontinue its Retail
segment, which operated three farm and ranch retail stores in Seguin, Hockley
and Denton, Texas. The Company decided that the Retail segment did not fit into
its long-term plans of growing its core heavy-duty truck and construction
equipment businesses. The Denton store was closed in December 2002; the Hockley
store began liquidating inventory during November 2002 and completed the
liquidation on March 9, 2003. The Company sold the Seguin store and the Hockley
real estate in the fourth quarter of 2004. As a result of these actions, the
Retail segment will no longer be reported as a separate business segment. As a result of these decisions, the Company recognized nonrecurring and
unusual charges, net of income tax benefits, of $83 million $058 per diluted
share in the fourth quarter of 2002. The $83 million in charges recorded in
the fourth quarter of 2002 included charges, net of income tax benefits, of
approximately $25 million related to the Michigan John Deere construction
equipment stores sold during December 2002. The remaining $58 million in
charges relate to the closing, liquidation and pending sale of Retail segment
stores described above. These charges are included in discontinued operations
in the Companys consolidated statements of income in accordance with SFAS 144.
In addition, the results of operations of these businesses have been classified
as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income
for all periods presented. Similarly, certain assets of these businesses have
been separately identified in the consolidated balance sheet as being held for
sale. The Company sold these assets in the fourth quarter of 2004. In
accordance with SFAS 144, depreciation and amortization expense were not
recorded with respect to the assets of these businesses. Net sales and earnings
loss before income taxes related to the discontinued businesses were as

Included in the $41 million Michigan construction equipment stores
charge for 2002 was a goodwill impairment of $22 million, a loss on the
disposal of inventory of $15 million, $07 million expense for early
termination benefits, and a gain on the sale of fixed assets of $03 million.
The remaining charges are related to costs associated with infrastructure
reduction, including professional fees and facilities. No further charges
related to the disposition were incurred during 2003. Included in the $90 million DD charge for 2002 was a $51 million
loss for the sale of fixed assets, $15 million loss on the disposal of
inventory, $11 million expense for early termination benefits and a $10
million impairment of goodwill. The remaining charges were related to costs
associated with infrastructure reduction, including professional fees and
facilities. No further charges related to the disposition were incurred during
2003. The 2004 DD charges related to discontinued operations include a
$04 million charge for the disposal of the real estate in Hockley, Texas and a
$03 million gain on the sale of the Seguin real estate, inventory and other
assets. The $04 million income tax expense is primarily related to tax expense
recorded to establish a reserve for the estimated unusable portion of DDs
stated net operating loss carry forward. The major classes of assets of the discontinued operations classified

4. SUPPLIER
AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various
companies Distributors. These agreements are nonexclusive agreements that
allow the Company to stock, sell at retail and service trucks, equipment and
products of the Distributors in the Companys defined market. The agreements
allow the Company to use the Distributors name, trade symbols and intellectual
property and expire as follows 
Distributor
Expiration Dates
Peterbilt
December
2005 to January 2008
John Deere
Indefinite
These agreements, as well as agreements with various other
Distributors, impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the Company,
including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the
maintenance of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of these
restrictions could result in the 45 loss of the Companys right to purchase the Distributors products and
use the Distributors trademarks. As of December31, 2004, the Companys
management believes it was in compliance with all the restrictions and
obligations of its dealership agreements. The Company purchases its new Peterbilt vehicles and most of its parts
from PACCAR, the maker of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices
charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new Peterbilt trucks accounted for
98%, 95% and 93% of the Companys new vehicle sales for the years ended
December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The Company purchases most of its new construction equipment and parts
from John Deere at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales
of new John Deere equipment accounted for 91%, 93% and 84% of the Companys new
equipment sales for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively. Primary Lenders The Company purchases its new and used truck and construction equipment
inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs offered by
various financial institutions and John Deere. The financial institution the
Company uses for truck inventory purchases also provides the Company with a
line of credit that allows the Company to borrow up to $135 million and with
notes on certain real estate properties. The floor plan agreement with the
financial institution the Company uses for truck inventory purchases provides
that such agreement may be terminated at the option of the lender with notice
of 120 days. The floor plan agreement with one of the financial institutions used
for construction equipment purchases expires in December 2005. Additional floor
plan financing is provided by John Deere pursuant to the Companys equipment
dealership agreement. These agreements provide that the occurrence of certain
events will be considered events of default. There were no known events of
default as of December 31, 2004. In the event that the Companys financing
becomes insufficient, or its relationship with the current primary lenders
terminates, the Company would need to obtain similar financing from other
sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or
alternative financing if necessary. The Companys debt agreements include certain restrictive covenants.
The Company was in compliance with these and all debt covenants as of December
31, 2004. Concentrations of Credit
Risks Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with what it considers to be quality financial institutions. At
December31, 2004, the Company had deposits in excess of federal insurance
totaling approximately $1546 million. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
reduced because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the
Companys customer base, thus spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of
the Companys business, however, is concentrated in the United States
heavy-duty trucking and construction equipment markets and related
aftermarkets. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by
selling certain trade receivables without recourse. After the Company enters
into a finance contract, the Company generally sells the contracts to a third
party. These finance contracts are sold both with and without recourse. A
majority of the Companys finance contracts are sold without recourse. The
Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and a reserve for
repossession losses related to finance contracts sold. Historically, the
Companys allowance and reserve has covered future losses. 46 5. ACCOUNTS

47 Allowance for Doubtful Receivables The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible warranty
receivables. The Company evaluates the collectibility of its warranty claims
receivable based on a combination of factors, including aging and
correspondence with the applicable manufacturer. Management reviews the warranty
claims receivable aging and adjusts the allowance based on historical
experience. The Company records charge-offs related to warranty receivables on
an as-needed basis. The Company sells a majority of its customer accounts
receivable to a third party that is responsible for qualifying the customer for
credit at the point of sale. All credit risk is assumed by the third party;
therefore, the Company provides no allowance for customer accounts receivable. Inventory The Company provides a reserve for obsolete and slow moving parts. The
reserve is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly
basis. The Company relies on historical information to support its reserve.
Once the inventory is written down, the Company does not adjust the reserve
balance until the inventory is sold. The Company recognized $121,000 of pretax
parts valuation losses for obsolete and slow moving parts during 2003 and
$131,000 during 2004. The valuation for new and used truck inventory is based on specific identification.
A detail of new and used truck inventory is reviewed and, if necessary,
adjustments to the value of specific units are made on a quarterly basis. The
Company recognized $13million of pretax new and used vehicle inventory
valuation losses during 2003 and $04 million of pretax used vehicle inventory
valuation losses during 2004. 8. FLOOR
PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Companys
purchase of new and used trucks and construction equipment. These notes are
collateralized by the inventory purchased and accounts receivable arising from
the sale thereof. The Companys floor plan notes have interest rates based on
the prime rate or LIBOR, as defined in the agreements. The interest rates
applicable to these agreements ranged from approximately 46% to 529% as of
December 31, 2004. Amounts borrowed under these agreements are due when the
related truck or construction equipment inventory collateral is sold and the
sales proceeds are collected by the Company, or in the case of construction
equipment rentals, when the carrying value of the equipment is reduced. These
agreements may be modified, suspended or terminated by the lender as described
in Note 4. The Companys floor plan agreement with its primary truck lender limits
the borrowing capacity based on the number of new and used trucks that may be
financed. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate amount of unit capacity for
new trucks was 1,542 and the aggregate amount of unit capacity for used trucks
was 540; the availability for new trucks was 257 and the availability for used
trucks was 132. The Companys floor plan agreement with one of its construction
equipment lenders is based on the book value of the Companys construction
equipment inventory. As of December31, 2004, the aggregate amount of
borrowing capacity with this lender was $105 million, with approximately
$66million outstanding. Additional amounts are available under the
Companys John Deere dealership agreement. At December31, 2004,
approximately $16million was outstanding pursuant to the John Deere
dealership agreement. 48 Amounts of collateral as of December31,

Lines of Credit The Company has a
separate line of credit agreement with a financial institution that provides
for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $135 million, with advances generally
limited to 75% of the Companys new parts inventory. Advances bear interest at
prime less 05%, which was 475% on December 31, 2004. Advances under the
line-of-credit agreement are secured by new parts inventory. The line of credit
agreement contains financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with
these covenants on December31, 2004. Either party may terminate the agreement
with 30days written notice. As of December31, 2003, advances
outstanding under this line-of-credit agreement amounted to $135 million. As
of December31, 2004, advances outstanding under this line-of-credit
amounted to $10,000 with $1349 million available for future borrowings. This
line is discretionary and may be modified, suspended or terminated at the
election of the lender. The Company has three additional separate secured lines
of credit that provide for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $159 million.
Advances outstanding under these secured lines of credit in aggregate were $24
million, with an additional $42 million pledged to secure various letters of
credit related to self-insurance products, leaving $93 million available for
future borrowings as of December 31, 2004. 9. LONG-TERM

The interest rates on the Companys variable interest rate notes are
based on LIBOR and the prime rate on December31, 2004. Interest rates on
the notes ranged from approximately 414% to 525% on December 31, 2004.
Payments on the notes range from $2,667 to $67,000 per month, plus interest.

institutions and had interest rates ranging from approximately 383% to 1079%
on December31, 2004. Payments on the notes range from $167 to $25,333 per
month, plus interest. Maturities of these notes range from January 2005 to
January 2016. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used primarily to
acquire land, buildings and improvements, transportation equipment and leasing
vehicles. The notes are secured by the assets acquired with the proceeds of
such notes. 10. DISCLOSURES
ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instrument held by the Company Current assets and current liabilities The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these
items. Long-term debt -
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is based on secondary market
indicators. Since the Companys debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each
obligations characteristics, including remaining maturities, interest rate,
credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and liquidity. The carrying
amount approximates fair value. 11. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION
PLAN The Company has a defined contribution plan the Rush Plan, which is
available to all Company employees and the employees of certain affiliates.
Each employee who has completed 90 days of continuous service is entitled to
enter the Rush Plan on the first day of the following month. Participating
employees may contribute from 1% to 50% of total gross compensation. However,
certain higher paid employees are limited to a maximum contribution of 15% of
total gross compensation. For the first 10% of an employees contribution, the
Company, at its discretion, may contribute an amount equal to 25% of the
employees contributions for those employees with less than five years of
service and an amount equal to 50% of the employees contributions for those
employees with more than five years of service. During the year ended
December31, 2002, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $15
million related to the Rush Plan. During the year ended December31, 2003,
the Company incurred expenses of approximately $16 million related to the Rush
Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company incurred expenses of
approximately $18 million related to the Rush Plan. The Company currently does not provide any postretirement benefits nor
does it provide any postemployment benefits. 12. LEASES Vehicle Leases The Company leases vehicles primarily over periods ranging from one to
ten years under operating lease arrangements. These vehicles are subleased by
the Company to customers under various agreements. Generally, the Company is
required to incur all operating costs and pay a minimum rental and an excess
mileage charge based on maximum mileage over the term of the lease. Vehicle
lease expenses for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, were
approximately $50 million, $53 million and $60 million, respectively. 50 Minimum rental commitments for noncancelable vehicle leases in effect

13. STOCK OPTIONS AND
STOCK PLANS In April 1996, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush
Enterprises, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. The
Incentive Plan provides for the grant of stock options which may be
nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options for tax purposes, stock
appreciation rights issued independent of or in tandem with such options SARs,
restricted stock awards and performance awards. 51 The
aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to stock options or SARs
that may be granted to any one participant in any year under the Incentive Plan
is 100,000shares of Class A Common Stock and 100,000 shares of Class B
Common Stock. The Company has 2,600,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and
1,400,000 shares of Class B Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of
any awards granted under the Companys Incentive Plan. On
April8, 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend
of one common share purchase right a Right for each share of common stock
outstanding. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one share of Class A Common Stock and one share of Class B Common Stock
at a price of $1750 per share the Purchase Price. The Rights are not
exercisable until the distribution date, as defined in the Rights Agreement.
The Rights will expire on April7, 2006 the Final Expiration Date,
unless the Final Expiration Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier
redeemed or exchanged by the Company. Effective
at the close of business on July9, 2002, the Board of Directors of the
Company reclassified the Old Common Stock as Class B Common Stock and declared
a stock dividend of one share of a new Class A Common Stock for each share of
Class B Common Stock. In
March2002, the Company granted options under the Incentive Plan to
purchase an aggregate of 250,000 shares of Old Common Stock to employees. Each
option vests in three equal annual installments beginning on the third
anniversary of the grant date. The exercise price of the options was equal to
closing price, as reported by The Nasdaq National Market, of the
Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. On July9, 2002, each option
to purchase Old Common Stock became an option to purchase Class A Common Stock
and an option to purchase Class B Common Stock. Each of the new options became
exercisable at one-half of the original options exercise price, but the
vesting period was not affected. In
March2003, the Company granted options under the Incentive Plan to
purchase an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and 93,000
shares of Class B Common Stock. In March2004 and June2004, the
Company granted options under the Incentive Plan to purchase an aggregate of
187,850 shares of Class A Common Stock and 43,500 shares of Class B Common
Stock. Each option vests in three equal annual installments beginning on the
third anniversary of the grant date. During
2000, the Company granted options outside of any plan to purchase an aggregate
of 169,258 shares of common stock to employees. A total of 69,258 of these
options were forfeited in 2001 and 2002. The exercise price of the options was
equal to closing price, as reported by The Nasdaq National Market,
of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. On July9, 2002, each
of the remaining options to purchase Old Common Stock became an option to
purchase Class A Common Stock and an option to purchase Class B Common Stock.
Each of the new options became exercisable at one-half of the original options
exercise price, but the vesting period was not affected. In
July2004, 70,000 options to purchase Class A Common Stock and 70,000
options to purchase Class B Common Stock were exercised. The remaining 30,000
options to purchase Class A Common Stock and 30,000 options to purchase Class B
Common Stock were outstanding and exercisable at December31, 2004. During
1997, the Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Rush Enterprises,
Inc. 1997 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan,
reserving 300,000 shares of Old Common Stock for issuance upon exercise of any
awards granted under the Plan. The Director Plan is designed to attract and
retain highly qualified non-employee directors. Under the terms of the Director
Plan, each non-employee director received options to purchase 10,000 shares of
the Old Common Stock on the date the Director Plan was adopted or upon their
respective date of appointment and an additional option to purchase 10,000
shares of the Old Common Stock each year they are elected by the shareholders
to serve on the Board of Directors, all of which vest immediately and expire
ten years from the grant date. The exercise price of the options was equal to
closing price, as reported by The Nasdaq National Market, of the
Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. During the year ended December31,
2002, 30,000 of such options were granted. On July9, 2002, each option to
purchase Old Common Stock became an option 52 to
purchase Class A Common Stock and an option to purchase Class B Common Stock.
Each of the new options became exercisable at one-half of the original options
exercise price. During the year ended December31, 2003, 60,000 options of
Class A Common Stock were granted under the terms of the Director Plan. During
the year ended December31, 2004, 80,000 options of Class A Common Stock
were granted under the terms of the Director Plan. During
2004, the Company implemented an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP that
allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward
the semi-annual purchase of the Companys Class A Common Stock. The employees
purchase price is 85% of the lesser of the closing price of the Class A Common
Stock on the first business day or the last business day of the semi-annual
offering period, as reported by The Nasdaq National Market.
Employees may purchase shares having a fair market value of up to $25,000
measured as of the first day of each semi-annual offering period for each
calendar year. No compensation expense is recorded in connection with the plan.
The total number of shares issuable under the plan is 600,000. No shares were
issued under the plan during fiscal 2004. Employee contributions during 2004 of
$144,048 were used to purchase 12,792 shares of Class A Common Stock in January2005.
Of the 1,924 employees eligible to participate, 92 were participants in the
plan as of December31, 2004. During
2001, the Company granted options outside any plan to purchase an aggregate of
60,000 shares of Old Common Stock to non-employee directors, which vested
immediately and expire ten years from the grant date. The exercise price of the
options was equal to closing price, as reported by The Nasdaq National Market,
of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. On July9, 2002, each
option to purchase Old Common Stock became an option to purchase Class A Common
Stock and an option to purchase Class B Common Stock. Each of the new options
became exercisable at one-half of the original options exercise price, but the
vesting period was not affected. A

14. EARNINGS
PER SHARE Earnings
per share for all periods have been restated to reflect the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS
128, which established standards for computing and presenting earnings per
share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or potential common
stock. This statement requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on
the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital
structures. Basic EPS were computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially
dilutive options and warrants that were outstanding during the period. The
following is a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
basic and diluted per share computations for net income.

As

approximately $792,000. 16. COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES The
Company is contingently liable to finance companies for certain notes initiated
on behalf of such finance companies related to the sale of trucks and
construction equipment. The majority of finance contracts are sold without
recourse to the Company. The Companys liability related to finance contracts
sold with recourse is generally limited to 5% to 20% of the outstanding amount
of each note initiated on the behalf of the finance company. However, in 2003
the Company instituted a full recourse finance program that accepts 100%
liability, with some restrictions, for the outstanding amount of each note
initiated on behalf of the finance company. In order for a contract to be
accepted into this full recourse finance program, a customer must meet strict
credit requirements or maintain a significant equity position in the truck
being financed; therefore, less than one percent of the finance contracts sold
by the Company are currently sold under the full recourse finance program and
the Company does not expect to finance a significant percentage of its truck
sales under this full recourse finance program in the future. The Company
provides for an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment
penalties. Finance
contracts initiated and sold during the years ended December31, 2002,
2003 and 2004, were $1441 million, $1651 million and $2599 million,
respectively. The
Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the final outcome
of any of the claims or proceedings to which the Company is a party would have
a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of
operations; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can
be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would
not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations for
the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred. 56 17. ACQUISITIONS See
Note 20 for a discussion of the Companys acquisition of certain assets of
American Truck Source, Inc. ATS. In
February2003, the Company acquired the common stock of Orange County
Truck and Trailer, Inc. Orange County, a Peterbilt dealer in central
Florida. The acquisition provides the Company with the rights to sell Peterbilt
trucks and parts from three locations in central Florida, including Orlando,
Haines City and Tampa. The transaction was valued at approximately $54
million, with the purchase price paid in cash. The
Orange County acquisition was accounted for as a purchase; operations of the
business acquired are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price was allocated based
on the fair values of the assets and liabilities at the date of the acquisition
as follows inthousands

Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc., which consisted of a dealership in Mobile, Alabama.
Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc.s primary line of business is the sale of new
Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks, parts and service. The
Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc. acquisition was accounted for as a purchase;
operations of the business acquired are included in the accompanying

Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information SFAS131. This statement requires that public
business enterprises report certain information about operating segments in
complete sets of financial statements of the enterprise and in condensed
financial statements of interim periods issued to shareholders. It also
requires that public business enterprises report certain information about
their products and services, the geographic areas in which they operate, and
their major customers. As
previously mentioned, in November2002 the Company announced its decision
to sell its John Deere construction equipment stores in Michigan and
discontinue its DD operations. In connection with this decision, financial
information related to the Companys construction equipment operations in
Michigan is not included in the Construction Equipment segment below, and the
Retail Segment is no longer presented as a separate operating segment. The
Company currently has two reportable business segments: the Heavy-Duty Truck
segment and the Construction Equipment segment. The Heavy-Duty Truck segment
operates a regional network of truck centers that provide an integrated
one-stop source for the trucking needs of its customers, including retail sales
of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks; aftermarket parts, service and
body shop facilities; and a wide array of financial services, including the
financing of new and used truck purchases, insurance products and truck leasing
and rentals. The Construction Equipment segment operates a full-service John
Deere dealership that serves the Houston, Texas area. Dealership operations
include the retail sale of new and used construction equipment, aftermarket
parts and service facilities, equipment rentals, and the financing of new and
used construction equipment. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance
based on income before income taxes not including extraordinary items. The
Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or
transfers were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. There were
no material intersegment sales during the years ended December31, 2002,
2003 and 2004. The
Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different
products and services. They are managed separately because each business unit
requires different technology and marketing strategies. Business units were
maintained through expansion and acquisitions. Assets held for sale and
goodwill related to discontinued operations are included in the Heavy-Duty
Truck segment for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2003. The
following table contains summarized information about reportable segment profit
or loss and segment assets for the years ended December31, 2002, 2003 and

from segments below the quantitative thresholds are attributable to three
operating segments of the Company. Those segments include a tire company, an
insurance company, and a hunting lease operation. None of those segments has
ever met any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable
segments. 20. SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS Effective
January1, 2005, the Company acquired certain assets of ATS, including its
Peterbilt truck dealerships in Texas and Tennessee for a total purchase price
of $1312 million. The acquisition provides Rush with rights to sell Peterbilt
trucks and parts from new locations in Dallas, Fort Worth, Abilene and Tyler,
Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee. The transaction was financed with Company cash
of $769 million, expansion of the Companys existing floor plan agreement for
truck inventory of $346 million and the issuance of debt of approximately
$197 million to finance real estate and leasing vehicles. Of the $769 million
paid in cash, $219 million was for the purchase of a note receivable from the
selling shareholders of ATS. This $219 million was immediately repaid by the
selling shareholders at closing, resulting in net cash used in the acquisition
of $550 million. The acquisition expands the Companys presence in the
southern United States and results in the Company operating Rush Truck Centers
at 44 locations in nine states. The
ATS acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price has
been allocated based on the fair values of the assets at the date of
acquisition as follows inthousands
