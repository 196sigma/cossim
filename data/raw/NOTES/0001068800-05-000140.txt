ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Cenveo, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cenveo,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 listed in the
Index at a2. These financial statements and schedules are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Cenveo, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of
Cenveo, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control--Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

23      REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Shareholders and Board of Directors
Cenveo, Inc.
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that
Cenveo, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Cenveo, Inc.
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of
the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Cenveo, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
criteria. Also, in our opinion, Cenveo, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004 of Cenveo, Inc. and our report dated February 28, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION. Cenveo, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively,
the Company are engaged in commercial printing, the printing and
manufacturing of envelopes and the printing and manufacturing of business
forms and labels. On April 29, 2004, the shareholders of the Company
approved the change of the Company name from Mail-Well, Inc. to Cenveo,
Inc. The Company, headquartered in Englewood, Colorado, is organized under
Colorado law, and its common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol CVO.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cenveo,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company has also consolidated a
variable interest entity pursuant to Financial Accounts Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 FIN 46. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated and
all amounts and disclosures reflect the Company continuing operations.
The Company reporting periods for 2004, 2003 and 2002 in this report
consist of 53-, 52- and 52-week periods, respectively, ending on the Saturday
closest to the last day of the calendar month. The reporting periods for
2004, 2003 and 2002 ended January 1, 2005, December 28, 2003 and December
27, 2002, respectively. For convenience, the accompanying financial
statements have been shown as ending on December 31.
USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates
and assumptions are used for, but not limited to, establishing the
allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, depreciation
and amortization, asset impairment evaluations, tax assets and liabilities,
self-insurance accruals and other contingencies. Actual results could
differ from the estimates made by management.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
deposit and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair
value.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the
invoiced amount. The Company maintains a valuation allowance based upon the
expected collectibility of accounts receivable. Uncollected account
balances are charged to the allowance after all means of collection have
been exhausted and the potential for recovery is remote. Allowances for
losses on accounts receivable of $47 million and $40 million have been
applied as reductions of accounts receivable at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost includes
materials, labor and overhead. The estimates of reserves for unsaleable
inventory are based on management judgment of future realization.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment are stated
at cost. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related
costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Expenditures for repairs
and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, and expenditures that
increase the capacity, efficiency or useful lives of existing assets are
capitalized.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of 15 to 45 years for buildings and building
improvements, 10 to 15 years for machinery and equipment and three to 10
years for furniture and fixtures.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
COMPUTER SOFTWARE. The Company develops and purchases software for
internal use. Software development costs incurred during the application
development stage are capitalized. Once the software has been installed and
tested and is ready for use, additional costs incurred in connection with
the software are expensed as incurred. Capitalized computer software costs
are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, usually
between three and seven years. Net computer software costs included in
property, plant and equipment were $116 million and $87 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. Direct expenses such as legal, accounting and
underwriting fees incurred to issue debt, are included in other assets in
the consolidated balance sheets. The debt issuance costs were $163 million
and $156 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, net of
accumulated amortization, and are amortized over the term of the related
debt as interest expense. Interest expense includes $44 million, $40
million and $54 million of debt issuance costs amortized in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Goodwill represents the excess of
acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill is reviewed annually to determine if there is an impairment, or
more frequently, if an indication of possible impairment exists. The Company
performs its annual impairment assessments in the fourth quarter of the
year. The transitional impairment recognized in 2002 upon the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets was $1117 million. No additional impairment
charges were recorded in 2004 or 2003.
Other intangible assets primarily arise from the purchase price
allocations of businesses acquired and are based on independent appraisals
or internal estimates. Intangible assets with determinable lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life assigned
to these assets. Intangible assets that are expected to generate cash flows
indefinitely are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment similarly
to goodwill.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS. Long-lived assets, including property, plant and
equipment, and intangible assets with determinable lives, are evaluated for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment is
assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an
asset are less than its carrying amount. Impairment losses are recognized
for the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair
value. The estimated useful lives of all long-lived assets are periodically
reviewed and revised if necessary.
SELF-INSURANCE. The Company is self-insured for the majority of its
workers' compensation costs and group health insurance costs, subject to
specific retention levels. The Company records its liability for workers'
compensation claims on a fully-developed basis. The Company liability for
health insurance claims includes an estimate for claims incurred but not
reported.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and
collection is reasonably assured. The Company records revenue to a lesser
extent on a bill and hold basis when requested by the customer. Revenue is
recognized on bill and hold transactions when the customer is invoiced for
goods that have been produced, packaged and made ready for shipment. These
goods are segregated from inventory which is available for sale, the risk
of ownership of the goods is assumed by the customer, and the terms and
collection experience on the related billings are consistent with all other
sales.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Since a significant portion of the Company products are customer
specific, it is common for customers to inspect the quality of the product
at the Company facility prior to its shipment. Products shipped are not
subject to contractual right of return provisions.
The Company has rebate agreements with certain customers. These rebates
are recorded as reductions of sales and are accrued using sales data and
rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement.
FREIGHT COSTS. The costs of delivering finished goods to customers are
recorded as freight costs and included in cost of sales. Freight costs that
are included in the price of the product are included in net sales.
ADVERTISING COSTS. All advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs were $55 million, $57 million and $60 million in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than
the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. The effects of
translation are included as a component of other comprehensive income.
Income and expense items are translated at the average monthly rate.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in income.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. Stock options and other stock-based
compensation awards are accounted for using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. This method requires compensation expense to be
recognized for the excess of the quoted market price of the stock at the
grant date or the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock.
If the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company pro forma

RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In November 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory
Costs--an amendment of ARB No. 43 Chapter 4. This statement requires
abnormal production costs such as idle facility expense, excessive
spoilage, rehandling costs and abnormal freight to be excluded from
inventory costing and treated as period expenses. In addition, this
standard requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to be based
on normal capacity of the production facility. The Company does not expect
the adoption of this standard in 2005 to have a significant effect on its
results.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment: an amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and 95 SFAS
No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair value. The Company expects to implement SFAS
123R in the third quarter of 2005 and use the modified-prospective
transition method of implementation. Under the modified-prospective
transition method, the Company will recognize compensation expense in the
financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption, which will
be July 1, 2005, for all share-based payments granted, modified or settled
after July 1, 2005 as well as for any awards that were granted prior to
July 1, 2005 for which the requisite service has not been provided as of
July 1, 2005. The Company will recognize compensation expense on awards
granted subsequent to July 1, 2005 using the fair values determined by a
valuation model prescribed by SFAS 123R. The compensation expense on awards
granted prior to July 1, 2005 will be recognized using the fair values
determined for the pro forma disclosures on stock-based compensation. The
amount of compensation expense that will be recognized on awards that have
not fully vested will exclude the compensation expense cumulatively
recognized in the pro forma disclosures on stock-based compensation. The
Company preliminary estimate of the compensation expense that will be
recorded in 2005 on unvested awards at July 1, 2005 will be approximately
$20 million.

2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The Company adopted FIN 46 on January 1, 2003. FIN 46 required the
consolidation of a trust that was leasing equipment to the Company. The
Company is the primary beneficiary of this trust since it is subject to the
majority of the risk of loss from the activities of the trust. The Company
consolidated equipment valued at $181 million, net of accumulated
depreciation, and debt of $185 million and recorded a non-cash after-tax
charge of $03 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in the consolidated statement of operations for 2003. The
consolidation of the debt and equipment of the trust did not impact the
cash flows of the Company.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are
no longer required to be amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets that
have indefinite useful lives, however, must be tested annually for
impairment.
In the year of its adoption, SFAS No. 142 required a transitional
goodwill impairment evaluation, which was a two-step process. The first
step was to determine whether there was an indication that goodwill was
impaired on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 required a separate impairment
evaluation of each of the Company reporting units, which the Company
determined to be the same as its operating segments. To perform the first
step, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting
the expected future cash flows and using market multiples of comparable
companies. The fair value of each reporting unit was compared to its
carrying value, including goodwill. This first step evaluation indicated an
impairment of the goodwill recorded by the Company commercial printing
operations formerly the commercial printing segment.
Since the first step indicated an impairment of the goodwill of the
commercial printing operations, SFAS No. 142 required a second step to
determine the amount of the impairment. The amount of the impairment was
determined by comparing the implied fair value of this goodwill to its
carrying value. The implied fair value of the goodwill was determined by
allocating the fair value of the combined assets and liabilities of the
commercial printing operations as if these operations had been acquired and
the fair value was the purchase price. The excess purchase price over the
amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities was the implied value of
goodwill. The carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the implied value by
$1117 million, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for 2002.
The impairment loss on the goodwill recorded by the commercial printing
operations was due to the significant decline in the performance of these
operations in 2001 and the impact of that decline on expected future cash
flows.
3. ACQUISITIONS
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting;
accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses have
been recorded at estimated fair value at the date acquired with the excess
of the purchase price over the estimated fair value recorded as goodwill.
In July 2004, the Company purchased the stock of Valco Graphics Inc., a
commercial printing company in Seattle, Washington with annual sales of
approximately $180 million. The purchase price was $96 million with $51
million allocated to tangible net assets and $45 million allocated to
goodwill. The Company is consolidating Valco Graphics Inc. with its
existing commercial printing operation in Seattle and will operate the
combined entity as Cenveo, Seattle.
In August 2004, the Company purchased the assets of WWP Property
Management, Inc., a commercial printing company in San Francisco,
California with annual sales of approximately $140 million. The purchase
price was $28 million with $27 million allocated to tangible net assets
and $01 million allocated to goodwill. The Company has consolidated this
operation with its existing commercial printing operation in San Francisco
and is operating the combined entity as Cenveo, San Francisco.

3. ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
In August 2002, the Company acquired the in-house printing and
fulfillment operations of American Express Company. The purchase price was
$191 million of which $13 million was paid in 2002, $28 million in 2003
and $32 million in 2004. The remaining purchase price, which was accrued
in 2004, will be paid in annual amounts through 2007 and reflected in the
statements of cash flows when paid. The purchase price was allocated as
follows: $13 million to tangible net assets, $08 million to goodwill and
$170 million to a customer-related intangible asset that is being
amortized over the term of a service agreement that expires at the end of
2007.
The results of these acquired businesses have been included in the
consolidated results of the Company from their respective acquisition dates.
Pro forma results for 2004 and 2002, assuming these acquisitions had been
made at the beginning of the applicable year, would not be materially
different from results reported.
4. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In September 2000, the Company sold the extrusion coating and
laminating business segment of American Business Products, Inc., a company
acquired in February 2000. The consideration received for this business
included an unsecured note which was fully reserved at the time of the
sale. This note was redeemed by the issuer in June 2004 for $20 million.
The proceeds, net of tax, have been recorded as a gain on disposal of
discontinued operations in 2004.
The gain on disposal of discontinued operations recorded for 2003
reflects a change in the tax impact of the disposition of the Company
prime label business, which was sold in May 2002. This gain was partially
offset by the accrual of additional expenses related to the sale.
In 2002, the Company sold Curtis 1000 for $400 million, including the
assumption of debt, and the prime label operating segment for $750 million.
Curtis 1000 and the prime label business were segregated from continuing
operations and reported as discontinued operations in 2001. The loss of
$169 million on disposal of discontinued operations recorded in 2002 was
based on actual proceeds which were less than expected, actual expenses
which were greater than originally estimated and the tax benefit of the
losses which was less than originally estimated.
Interest expense was allocated to the operating results and included in
the calculation of the loss on disposal of discontinued operations based
upon the relative net assets of the prime label business and Curtis 1000.
This allocation of interest expense totaled $56 million in 2002. Tax
benefits allocated to discontinued operations based on the losses of these
operations was $16 million in 2002.
Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized as

December 31, 2002.
6. IMPAIRMENT ON OPERATIONS FORMERLY HELD FOR SALE
In 2001, a business that is now part of the resale segment, was held
for sale and reported as a discontinued operation. In 2002, the Company
discontinued its efforts to sell this business. Accordingly, the tax
benefit of $115 million expected to be realized upon the sale that had
been recorded in 2001 was written off and expenses of $11 million that had
been accrued but not incurred were reversed. In 2002, the Company also
discontinued its efforts to sell a digital graphics operation that was held
for sale at the end of 2001 and recorded an impairment charge of $24
million.

was 47%. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the assets
of the Company. In March 2004, the Company amended the Credit Facility to
extend its term to June 2008. The cost incurred to amend the Credit
Facility was $19 million. These debt issuance costs will be amortized over
the extended term of the Credit Facility.
In January 2004, the Company issued $3200 million of 7 7/8% senior
subordinated notes due 2013 Senior Subordinated Notes. The interest on
these notes is payable semi-annually. The Company may redeem these notes,
in whole or in part, on or after December 1, 2008, at redemption prices
from 1039% to 100%, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The net proceeds
from the sale of the Senior Subordinated Notes were used to fund the tender
offer and redemption of the Company 8 3/4% senior subordinated notes
which were due to mature in 2008. The loss recorded on the early
extinguishment of the 8 3/4% senior subordinated notes consisted of
redemption premiums of $135 million and unamortized debt issuance costs of
$42 million. The debt issuance costs for the Senior Subordinated Notes
totaled $72 million which will be amortized over the term of the notes.
The Company $3500 million 9 5/8% Senior Notes due 2012 Senior
Notes were issued in 2002 and pay interest semi-annually. The Company may
redeem the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, on or after March 15, 2007,
at redemption prices from 1048% to 100%, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

12. LONG-TERM DEBT CONTINUED
Other long-term debt includes debt of $140 million and $170 million
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of a variable interest entity
that was consolidated on January 1, 2003 as a result of the adoption of FIN
46. The interest on this debt was 58% at December 31, 2004. The remaining
balance in other long-term debt is primarily term debt with banks with
interest rates, which range from 23% to 101%, and capital lease
obligations.

Cash interest payments on long-term debt were $674 million in 2004 681 million in 2003 and $630 million in 2002.
The estimated fair value of the Company Credit Facility, Senior
Notes, Senior Subordinated Notes and other long-term debt was $7839
million and $7845 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Senior Subordinated Notes contain
certain restrictions that, among other things and with certain exceptions,
limit the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, prepay
subordinated debt, transfer assets outside of the Company, pay dividends or
repurchase shares of common stock. The Company is only required to maintain
certain levels of fixed charge coverage under the Credit Facility in the
event that availability falls below a certain amount. As of December 31,
2004, the Company was in compliance with all debt agreements.
GUARANTEES
In conjunction with the sale of the prime label business in 2002, the
Company continued to guarantee a lease obligation assumed by the buyer of
this business. The guarantee requires the lessor to pursue collection and
other remedies against the buyer before demanding payment from the Company.
The remaining payments under the lease term, which expires April 2008,
total approximately $55 million. If the Company were required to honor its
obligation under the guarantee, any loss would be reduced by the amount
generated from the liquidation of the equipment.

Deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in
the financial statements. The tax effects of these temporary differences are
recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax
assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or
credit in future years. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items
that have been deducted for tax purposes, but have not yet been recorded in
the consolidated statements of operations. Valuation allowances are recorded
in expense to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
that a tax benefit will not be realized. The tax effects of temporary
differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax
assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2004 and 2003 are

result, the Company determined that tax contingency reserves totaling $64
million were no longer necessary and these reserves were reversed.

to expire in 2007 and the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in
2021 through 2024. The Company valuation allowance increased $203 million
in 2004, $26 million in 2003 and $11 million in 2002. The increase in 2004
was primarily due to the additional net operating losses incurred in the
U.S. in 2004. Since the Company has had three consecutive years of U.S. net
operating losses, the increase in the valuation allowance was provided to
cover the impairment of the deferred tax asset the Company believes more
likely than not will not be realized through the reversal of taxable
temporary differences and the execution of available tax planning
strategies.
Net cash payments for income taxes were $147 million in 2004, $25
million in 2003 and $60 million in 2002.

printing operation in Indianapolis, Indiana and the redeployment of its two
web presses and related equipment to St. Louis, Missouri and Baltimore,
Maryland in 2002. A substantial portion of the cost to dismantle, move and
reinstall this equipment was incurred during 2003.
The Company was able to sub-lease a facility which was idled as a
result of the consolidation of its envelope plant in the Northeast sooner
than estimated when the liability under the lease contract was established.
Accordingly, $05 million of the reserve recorded for this lease was
reversed. In addition, the remaining expenses that had been accrued to
cover the cost of maintaining a building that was sold in 2003 were
reversed.
RESALE. In 2002, the resale segment closed its business forms plant in
Clearwater, Florida and consolidated its production in its plants in
Fairhope, Alabama and Marshall, Texas. The employee separation expenses and
other costs incurred as a result of this consolidation were less than
originally estimated.
CORPORATE. In February 2004, a jury in Los Angeles County, California

COMMERCIAL. The consolidation of envelope manufacturing facilities of
the commercial segment which began in 2001, was completed in 2002. The
objective of this consolidation was to reduce excess internal capacity and
improve utilization of the equipment and resources at the other envelope
plants in the United States and Canada. The costs incurred during 2002

employees hired at the plants that absorbed the production of the
plants that were closed. The training programs for these employees
were between three and nine months in duration.

dismantle, move and reinstall equipment, and the costs incurred to
restore buildings to the condition required by lease agreements or to
maintain them while they were held for sale.
* In 2001, employee separation expenses were accrued to cover the 766
employees expected to be affected over the course of this project. At
the completion of the project, 722 employees had been separated and
the accrual was reduced by $05 million.
The Company commercial printing operation in New York City was closed
in September 2002. Employee separation expenses of $10 million were

separation expenses covering 64 employees were $06 million. Impairment
charges related to equipment taken out of service as a result of these
closures totaled $06 million. Other expenses of $07 million primarily
related to expenses incurred to maintain two buildings held for sale.
The resale segment completed the closure of its envelope operations in
Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The costs in 2002 were $24 million which were
primarily impairment charges, consulting fees, the costs incurred to
dismantle, move and reinstall equipment and expenses incurred to clean up
the building.
The resale segment also incurred $22 million in expenses to reduce the
size of several of its other operations. Employee separation expenses
covering 193 employees were $08 million, asset impairments were $05
million and training, project management and other costs were $09 million.
OTHER CHARGES. Other charges include the following items   * In connection with the refinancing of the bank credit facility in
June 2002, an operating lease stemming from a sale/leaseback
arrangement executed in 1997 and amended in 2000 had to be
refinanced. The value of the equipment subject to the lease was
reduced from $349 million to $191 million, requiring a payment of
the difference of $158 million. In addition, deferred costs of $61
million associated with the lease prior to this refinancing were
written off.
* The Company used outside assistance to implement best practices and
standardize costing and pricing systems. The cost of this assistance
was $44 million.
* Idle equipment in the commercial segment was written down $18
million to its net realizable value.
* Severance payments unrelated to the restructure plans were $11
million.

RESTRICTED STOCK
Restricted stock has been granted to certain key executives under the
Incentive Plan as a long-term incentive subject to continued employment.
These shares carry voting rights; however, the shares may not be sold prior
to vesting. Restricted stock granted in 2002 vests 50% after five years of
service and 100% after six years and had a fair value of $148. In 2004,
the Company granted 288,788 shares of restricted stock with a fair value of
$328 to key executives. These shares vest at the end of five years.
The Company has awarded restricted stock to the members of the Board of
Directors. Restricted stock granted to the directors totaled 14,922 shares
in 2004, 30,816 shares in 2003 and 9,582 in 2002. The fair value per share
was $402 in 2004, $292 in 2003 and $626 in 2002. All awards to the
directors were fully vested at December 31, 2004.
Upon the issuance of restricted stock, the Company records unearned
compensation as a charge to shareholders' equity for the fair value of the
restricted stock on the date of grant. This unearned compensation is
recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. The
Company recorded compensation expense related to restricted stock in the
amount of $07 million in 2004, $08 million in 2003 and $06 million in
2002.

16. RETIREMENT PLANS
SAVINGS PLAN. The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan to
provide substantially all U.S. salaried and certain hourly employees an
opportunity to accumulate personal funds for their retirement. The Company
matches a certain percentage of each employee voluntary contribution. All
contributions made by the Company are made in cash and allocated to the
funds selected by the employee. Company contributions to the plan were
approximately $60 million in 2004, $60 million in 2003 and $65 million
in 2002. The plan held 4,594,544 shares of the Company common stock at
December 31, 2004.
PENSION PLANS. The Company maintains pension plans for certain of its
employees in the U.S. and Canada under collective bargaining agreements
with unions representing these employees. The Company expects to continue
to fund these plans based on governmental requirements, amounts deductible
for income tax purposes and as needed to ensure that plan assets are
sufficient to satisfy plan liabilities.
SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS. As a result of the acquisition
of American Business Products ABP in 2000, the Company assumed
responsibility for the ABP supplemental executive retirement plans SERP
which provide benefits to certain former directors and executives of ABP.
For accounting purposes, these plans are unfunded; however, ABP had
purchased annuities, which are included in other assets in the consolidated
balance sheets. These annuities cover a portion of the liability to the
participants in these plans and the income from the annuities offsets a
portion of the cost of the plans.

Rent expense was $377 million in 2004, $372 million in 2003 and $405
million in 2002.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. The Company has limited concentrations
of credit risk with respect to financial instruments. Temporary cash
investments and other investments are placed with high credit quality
institutions, and concentrations within accounts receivable are limited due
to the Company customer base and its dispersion across different
industries and geographic areas.
LITIGATION. The Company is party to various legal actions that are
ordinary and incidental to its business. While the outcome of pending legal
actions cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the outcome
of these various proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

18. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share exclude dilution and are computed by dividing
net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings loss per share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if options to issue common stock were
exercised. A reconciliation of the amounts included in the computation of
basic earnings loss per share and diluted earnings loss per share is as
follows in thousands, except per share amounts                                 2004      2003      2002

In 2004 and 2002, outstanding options to purchase 1,145,000 and 50,000
common shares, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. In
2004, 2003 and 2002, outstanding options to purchase approximately
5,847,000, 5,111,000 and 5,392,000 common shares were excluded from the
calculation of net income per diluted common share because their exercise
price exceeded the average market price of the common stock for the year.
19. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company operates two business segments. The commercial segment
consists of commercial printing facilities that specialize in printing of
annual reports, car brochures, brand marketing collateral, catalogs, maps
