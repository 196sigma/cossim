Item8 Note9. The price of our common stock may fluctuate
significantly. The price of our common stock has been, and is
likely to continue to be, highly volatile, which means that it
could decline substantially. The price of our common stock could
fluctuate significantly for the following reasons, among others   
future announcements concerning us or our
competitors;
quarterly variations in operating results;
business acquisitions or divestitures;
changes in earnings estimates by analysts;
changes in third-party reimbursement practices;
regulatory developments;
changes in the number of outstanding
shares;or
fluctuations in the economy or general market
conditions.
In addition, stock markets in general, and the
market for shares of healthcare stocks in particular, have
experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent
years which have frequently been unrelated to the operating
performance of the affected companies. These broad market
fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below
its current price and the market price of our common stock may
fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be
unrelated to our performance. In the past, stockholders have often instituted
securities class action litigation after periods of volatility
in the market price of a companys securities. If a
stockholder files a securities class action lawsuit against us,
we would incur substantial legal fees and our managements
attention and resources would be diverted from operating our
business in order to respond to the litigation. See
Item3.Legal Proceedings. We rely on reimbursement from governmental
programs for a majority of our revenues and we cannot assure you
that reimbursement levels will not decrease in the
future. Changes in the reimbursement policies of the
Medicare or Medicaid programs as a result of budget cuts by
federal and state governments or other legislative and
regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows. We have experienced increases in our state
Medicaid rates averaging 46%, 36% and 67% for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. However, in
the past, states have curtailed their Medicaid payments as a
result of budget considerations. Curtailments of Medicaid
funding by a state can affect long-term care providers and/or
other non-eldercare providers in that state. Currently, several
states in which we operate are experiencing deficits in their
fiscal operating budgets. There can be no assurance that 15 Table of Contents those states in which we operate that are
experiencing budget deficits, as well as other states in which
we operate, will not reduce payment rates. The Budget Act broadened the states
authority to develop their own standards for setting payment
rates. It requires each state to use a public process for
establishing proposed rates whereby the methodologies and
justifications used for setting such rates are available for
public review and comment. This requires nursing facilities to
become more involved in the rate setting process since failure
to do so may interfere with a facilitys ability to
challenge rates later. In recent years, there have also been reductions
in payments to skilled nursing facilities under the Medicare
program. Although the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999
BBRA and the Benefits Improvement and Protection
Act of 2000 BIPA reversed certain rate reductions
enacted under the Budget Act, some of these increases expired on
September30, 2002, the so-called Medicare
cliff. While CMS announced two increases to skilled
nursing facility rates effective October 2003, and will continue
certain add-ons for high-acuity patients until CMS refines the
RUG system, there can be no assurances that payments from the
Medicare program will remain at levels comparable to present
levels or will, in the future, be sufficient to cover the costs
allocable to Medicare patients. In addition, as required by the Budget Act, CMS
imposed annual limits per beneficiary of $1,590 for physical and
speech therapy services combined and $1,590 for occupational
therapy. These caps were applied to services provided during the
period from September1, 2003 through December8,
2003. Although Congress imposed a further moratorium from
December8, 2003 through December31, 2005 in the
provisions of the Prescription Drug Bill, there can be no
assurance that the caps will not go into effect on
January1, 2006. On February10, 2003, CMS published a
proposed rule to reduce by 30 percent the amount that Medicare
reimburses skilled nursing facilities and other non-hospital
providers for bad debts arising from uncollectible Medicare
coinsurance and deductibles. The proposal is to phase in the
reduction over a three-year period at 10percent per year.
Based on our current volume of Medicare bad debts, this proposed
rule would reduce our revenues by $16million 31million and $50million for the first, second
and third year, respectively. We cannot currently determine if
and when this rule will be implemented. Governmental payment programs are subject to
statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments,
administrative or executive orders and government funding
restrictions, all of which may materially decrease the rate of
government program payments to us for our services. Our
financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
affected by reductions in reimbursement levels and the
reimbursement process in general, which in the healthcare
industry is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the
time that revenue is recognized and the time that reimbursement
amounts are settled. Our industry is heavily regulated by the
government, which requires our compliance with a variety of
laws. The operation of our facilities and the services
we provide are subject to periodic inspection by governmental
authorities to ensure that we are complying with standards
established for continued licensure under state law and
certification for participation under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Additionally, in certain states, certificates of need
or other similar approvals are required for expansion of our
operations. We could be adversely affected if we are unable to
obtain these approvals, if the standards applicable to approvals
or the interpretation of those standards change and by possible
delays and expenses associated with obtaining approvals. Our
failure to obtain, retain or renew any required regulatory
approvals, licenses or certificates could prevent us from being
reimbursed for certain of our services. In the ordinary course of our business, and like
other providers in the healthcare industry, we receive requests
for information from government agencies in connection with
their regulatory or investigational authority and notices of
deficiencies for failure to comply with various regulatory
requirements. We review all such notices and we believe that we
take timely and appropriate corrective action. In most cases,
with respect to these notices, the facility and the reviewing
agency will agree upon the steps to be taken to bring the
facility 16 Table of Contents into compliance with regulatory requirements. In
some cases or upon repeat violations, the reviewing agency may
take a number of adverse actions against a facility. These
adverse actions include   
the imposition of fines;
temporary suspension of payment for new patients
to the facility;
decertification from participation in the
Medicare or Medicaid programs;or
in extreme circumstances, revocation of a
facilitys license.
We have been subject to certain of these adverse
actions in the past and could be subject to adverse actions in
the future which could result in significant penalties, as well
as adverse publicity. Any such penalties or adverse publicity
could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations. We face periodic reviews, audits and
investigations under our contracts with federal and state
government agencies, and these audits could have adverse
findings that may negatively impact our business. As a result of our participation in the Medicare
and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental
reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with
these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Private pay
sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse
review, audit or investigation could result in   
refunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to
the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from private payors;
state or federal agencies imposing fines,
penalties and other sanctions on us;
loss of our right to participate in the Medicare
or Medicaid programs or one or more private payor
networks;and
damage to our reputation in various markets.
Both federal and state government agencies have
heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement
efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare
companies and, in particular, skilled nursing facilities. The
investigations include   
cost reporting and billing practices;
quality of care;
financial relationships with referral
sources;and
medical necessity of services provided.
We also are subject to potential lawsuits under a
federal whistleblower statute designed to combat fraud and abuse
in the healthcare industry. These lawsuits can involve
significant monetary awards to private plaintiffs who
successfully bring these suits. We are required to comply with laws
governing the transmission and privacy of health
information. HIPAA requires us to comply with certain
standards for the exchange of individually identifiable health
information within our Company and with third parties, such as
payors, business associates and patients. These include
standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims
information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use
of electronic signatures; unique identifiers for providers,
employers, and health plans; security; and privacy. Sanctions for failing to comply with the HIPAA
health information practices provisions include criminal
penalties and civil sanctions. The security standards went into
effect in April 2003, with a compliance date in April 2005 for
most covered entities. We cannot assure you that all of the
parties with whom we do business will be in compliance with
HIPAA. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be
subject to criminal 17 Table of Contents penalties and civil sanctions, which could have
an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. Healthcare reform legislation may adversely
affect our business. In recent years, there have been numerous
initiatives on the federal and state levels for comprehensive
reforms affecting the payment for and availability of healthcare
services. Aspects of certain of these healthcare initiatives,
such as reductions in funding of the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, potential changes in reimbursement regulations by CMS,
enhanced pressure to contain healthcare costs by Medicare,
Medicaid and other payors, greater state flexibility and
additional operational requirements, could adversely affect us.
There can be no assurance as to the ultimate content, timing or
effect of any healthcare reform legislation, nor is it possible
at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on
us. That impact may have an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. We are subject to increasingly expensive
and unpredictable patient care liability costs. General and professional liability costs for the
long-term care industry have become increasingly expensive and
difficult to estimate. We and others have experienced
substantial increases in both the number of claims and lawsuits,
as well as the size of the typical claim and lawsuit. The
long-term care industry has previously experienced significant,
unexpected increases in estimated ultimate costs for claims in
certain states or areas. In Texas and Florida, for example, the
growth in patient care liability claims and lawsuits reached a
level where it was not possible for us to continue to operate
profitably and we disposed of all our facilities in Texas in
1996 and Florida in 2002. We also have initiated several strategic and
tactical actions to mitigate the impact of these rising costs.
In late 2002, we identified those nursing facilities that
represented a disproportionately high share of projected patient
care liability costs. In early 2003, we began implementing a
strategy to divest, over a two-year period, properties that
accounted for approximately 50% of the annual patient care
liability costs projected at that time. We upgraded our risk
management and litigation functions, and adopted a more
coordinated and aggressive legal defense strategy. We began
using voluntary arbitration agreements in most of our nursing
facilities and improved communications with residents and their
families to resolve issues before they reach litigation. In
addition, we remain committed to continually improving the
quality of care we provide, adopting clinical performance
indicators to evaluate the care at each facility and including
quality care as a significant component of incentive
compensation at the facility, regional and corporate levels. If
patient care claims continue to increase in number and size, our
future financial condition and results of operations may be
adversely affected. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly
expensive and difficult to obtain for long-term care companies,
and our insurance carriers could become insolvent and unable to
reimburse us. Primarily as a result of patient care liability
costs for long-term care providers, insurance companies are
ceasing to insure long-term care companies, or severely limiting
their capacity to write long-term care general and professional
liability insurance. In addition, in the wake of the
September11, 2001 events, reduced overall insurance
capacity and increasing insurance company losses, the insurance
environment in general has become unstable, making it
increasingly difficult to obtain coverage for patient care
liabilities and certain other risks. When insurance coverage is
available, insurance carriers are typically requiring companies
to significantly increase their liability retention levels
and/or pay substantially higher premiums for reduced coverage.
This has been the case for most insurance coverages, including
workers compensation, employee healthcare and patient care
liability. We are experiencing higher premiums and retention
levels. Our insurance covering patient care liability and
workers compensation comes up for renewal in the second
quarter of 2004. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
renew our insurance coverages on terms as favorable as those we
currently have. We have purchased insurance for workers
compensation, property, casualty and other risks from numerous
insurance companies. In many cases, the policies provide
coverage for events occurring in specific 18 Table of Contents time frames that may only be determined in later
years. We exercise care in selecting companies from which we
purchase insurance, including review of published ratings by
recognized rating agencies, advice from national brokers and
consultants and review of trade information sources. There
exists a risk that any of these insurance companies may become
insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend, pay
or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due. Although we
believe the companies we have purchased insurance from are
solvent, in light of the dramatic changes occurring in the
insurance industry in recent years, we cannot assure you that
they will remain solvent and able to fulfill their obligations. State efforts to regulate the construction
or expansion of healthcare providers could impair our ability to
expand our operations. Some states require healthcare providers
including skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies,
hospices and assisted living centers to obtain prior approval,
known as a certificate of need a CON, for   
the purchase, construction or expansion of
healthcare facilities;
capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed
amount;or
changes in services or bed capacity.
To the extent that we are required to obtain a
CON or other similar approvals to expand our operations, either
by acquiring facilities or expanding or providing new services
or other changes, our expansion could be adversely affected by
our failure or inability to obtain the necessary approvals,
changes in the standards applicable to those approvals, and
possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining those
approvals. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
CON approval for all future projects requiring this approval. Our civil settlement agreement with the
United States Government with respect to alleged violations of
cost allocations under Medicare negatively impacts our cash
flows and subjects us to a Corporate Integrity
Agreement. On February3, 2000, we entered into a
series of separate agreements with the OIG of HHS. Under the
civil settlement agreement, we paid the federal government
$250million during the first quarter of 2000 and agreed
to reimburse the federal government an additional
$1450million through withholdings from our biweekly
Medicare periodic interim payments in equal installments ending
in the first quarter of 2008. As of December31, 2003, the
present value of the remaining obligation was
$619million. As a result of such withholdings, our cash
flows from operations were negatively impacted by
$181million during the year ended December31, 2003,
and are expected to be negatively impacted at an annual rate of
$181million. As part of this series of agreements, we entered
into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the OIG. This
agreement requires that we monitor, on an ongoing basis, our
compliance with the requirements of the federal healthcare
programs. This agreement addresses our obligations to ensure
that we comply with the requirements of participation in the
federal healthcare programs. It also includes functional and
training obligations, audit and review requirements and record
keeping and reporting requirements. In 2002, certain revisions
were made to our Corporate Integrity Agreement to reflect a
permanent injunction requiring our nursing facilities in
California to conduct additional training programs and to hire
an independent quality monitor for our nursing facilities in
California, Arizona, Hawaii and Washington to assess our quality
care systems. By December31, 2003, we had divested all of
our nursing facilities in Arizona and Washington and a
substantial portion of our nursing facilities in California and
Hawaii. We believe that we are generally in compliance with the
requirements of our Corporate Integrity Agreement and file
annual reports with the OIG documenting our compliance. If we
fail to comply with our Corporate Integrity Agreement, we may be
subject to penalties or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations. We are subject to material
litigation. We are, and may in the future be, subject to
litigation which, if determined adversely against us, could have
a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition. Pending, threatened or future litigation 19 Table of Contents could have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and results of operations. See
Item3.Legal Proceedings. If we fail to cultivate new, or maintain
existing, relationships with the physicians in the communities
in which we operate, our patient base may
decrease. Our patient base depends in part upon the
admissions and referral practices of the physicians in the
communities in which we operate and our ability to cultivate and
maintain relationships with these physicians. Physicians
referring patients to our facilities are not our employees and
are free to refer their patients to other providers. If we are
unable to successfully cultivate and maintain strong
relationships with these physicians, our patient population may
decline, which, if significant, could have an adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the mix of our patient
population among the Medicare, Medicaid and private categories
may significantly affect our nursing revenues and
profitability. The sources and amounts of our patient revenues
are determined by a number of factors, including licensed bed
capacity and census of our nursing facilities, average length of
stay of our residents, the mix of our patients by payor type
for example, Medicare versus Medicaid or private and the
acuity level of our patients. Changes in the case mix of
patients, the mix of patients by payor type and payment
methodologies may significantly affect our profitability. In
particular, changes which increase the percentage of Medicaid
residents within our nursing facilities could have an adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations,
especially in states whose reimbursement levels are below our
operating costs. Certain trends in the healthcare industry
are putting pressure on our ability to maintain nursing facility
census. Over the past decade, a number of trends have
developed that impact our census. These trends include   
overbuilding of nursing facilities in states that
have eliminated the CON process for new construction;
creation of nursing facilities by acute-care
hospitals to keep discharged patients within their complex;
rapid growth of assisted living centers, which
sometimes are more attractive to less medically complex
patients;and
the availability of eldercare services delivered
to the home.
The negative impact of these trends on nursing
facility census varies from facility to facility, from community
to community and from state to state, and if we are not
successful in responding to them, these trends could have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. Available Information The Companys website, www.beverlycares.com,

PROPERTIES. On December31, 2003, we operated 373
nursing facilities, 20 assisted living centers, 23 hospice and
home care centers and 10outpatient clinics in
26states and the District of Columbia. Most of our
98leased nursing facilities are subject to net
leases which require us to pay all taxes, insurance and
maintenance costs. Most of these leases have original terms from
ten to fifteen years and contain at least one renewal option.
Renewal options typically extend the original terms of the
leases by five to fifteen years. Many of these leases also
contain purchase options. We consider our physical properties to
be in good operating condition and suitable for the purposes for
which they are being used. Certain of our nursing facilities and
assisted living centers are included in the collateral securing
our obligations under various debt agreements. See
Item8.Note9. The following is a summary of our nursing
facilities, assisted living centers, hospice and home care

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. aAs previously reported, the following
derivative lawsuits have been filed in the state court of
Arkansas, as well as the federal district court in Arkansas,
assertedly on behalf of the Company collectively, the
Derivative Actions   
Norman M. Lyons v. David R. Banks,
etal., Case No.OT99-4041,
was filed in the Chancery Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas
4thDivision on or about July29, 1999, and the
parties filed an Agreed Motion to Stay the proceedings on
January17, 2000;
Badger v. David R. Banks, etal.,
Case No.LR-C-99-881, was filed
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Arkansas Western Division on November30, 1999;and
Richardson v. David R. Banks, etal.,
Case No.LR-C-99-826, was filed
in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Arkansas Western Division on November4, 1999.
The Badger and Richardson actions were ordered to
be consolidated as In re Beverly Enterprises, Inc. Derivative
Litigation and by agreed motion, plaintiffs filed an
amended, consolidated complaint on April21, 2000.
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative
complaint and a motion to strike portions thereof on
July21, 2000. The parties agreed to stay the consolidated
action pending the outcome of the motion to dismiss in a former
class action suit. In light of the dismissal of the former class
action suit, the Court entered a Scheduling Order dated
July17, 2003, which sets a trial date of March29,
2004, for this case. Defendants filed a motion to renew their
motion to dismiss on December17, 2003. The Derivative Actions each name the
Companys directors as defendants, as well as the Company
as a nominal defendant. The Lyons action also names as
defendants certain of the Companys current and former
officers. The Derivative Actions each allege breach of fiduciary
duties to the Company and its stockholders as a result of
alleged conduct giving rise to the ClassAction. The Lyons
and Richardson actions also assert claims for abuse of control
and constructive fraud arising from the same allegations and the
Richardson action also claims unjust enrichment. Due to the preliminary state of these actions, we
are unable to assess the probable outcome of the cases and can
give no assurances of the ultimate impact on our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. bOn August16, 2002, August26,
2002, and September26, 2002, respectively, Ernest
Baerv. Beverly Enterprises, Inc., et al. CIV. No.
02-2190, Stanley V. Kensicv. Beverly Enterprises,
Inc., et al. CIV. No. 02-2193 and Charles Krebsv.
Beverly Enterprises, Inc., et al. CIV. No. 02-2222 were
filed in the United States District Court, Western District of
Arkansas, FortSmith Division. These cases were filed as
purported securities fraud class actions under
Sections10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule10b-5 promulgated thereunder. These cases separately name Beverly Enterprises,
Inc. as a defendant along with various current officers and our
independent auditors. In all three cases, the purported class
period runs from October16, 2000 to and including
July19, 2002. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants, during
the purported class period, made multiple false and misleading
statements. In early March 2003, these cases were consolidated
as In re Beverly Enterprises, Inc. Securities Litigation.
On April30, 2003, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.
On May30, 2003, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss
the amended complaint. Briefing on the motion to dismiss was
completed July11, 2003. The court heard oral arguments on
the defendants motion on August28, 2003. On
December23, 2003, the court granted defendants
motions to dismiss with prejudice and denied plaintiffs
motion to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal on January22, 2004. Due to the preliminary state of
this action, the Company is unable to assess the probable
outcome of the case. We can give no assurances of the ultimate
impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows as a result of this proceeding. cOn October31, 2002, a shareholder
derivative action entitled Paul Dunne and Helene Dunne,
derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Beverly Enterprises,
Inc.v. Beryl F. Anthony, Jr., etal. was filed in
the Circuit Court of Sebastian County, Arkansas, FortSmith
Division No.CIV-2002-1241. This case is 22 Table of Contents purportedly brought derivatively on behalf of the
Company against various current and former officers and
directors. The complaint alleges causes of action for breach of
fiduciary duty against the defendants based on:
1allegations that defendants failed to establish and
maintain adequate accounting controls such that the Company
failed to record adequate reserves for patient care liability
costs; and 2allegations that certain defendants sold
Company stock while purportedly in possession of material
non-public information. On May16, 2003, two additional
derivative complaints Holcombev. Floyd, etal.
and Flowersv. Floyd, etal. were filed
and subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court of Sebastian
County, Arkansas, FortSmith Division and consolidated with
the Dunne action as Holcombv. Beverly Enterprises, Inc.
The Dunnes were subsequently dismissed as plaintiffs. On
June9, 2003, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, the
Court entered a scheduling order providing, among other things,
that plaintiffs will have thirty days from a ruling on the
motion to dismiss filed by defendants in the related securities
class action in federal court, In re Beverly Enterprises,
Inc. Securities Litigation Case No2:02 cv 2190, to
file an amended complaint and that defendants shall have thirty
days thereafter to respond to the complaint. The court entered a
ruling on the defendants motion to dismiss in the federal
securities class action on December23, 2003, and the
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on January22, 2004. In
light of the plaintiffs appeal, the parties have agreed to
a further stay of this derivative action pending resolution of
the appeal. Due to the preliminary state of this action, we are
unable to assess the probable outcome of the case and can give
no assurance of the ultimate impact on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. dIn 2002, we notified federal and
California healthcare regulatory authorities CMS, OIG, the
California Attorney Generals office and the California
Department of Health of our intent to conduct an internal
investigation of past billing practices relating to MK Medical,
our former medical equipment business unit based in Fresno,
California. An independent accounting firm has reviewed MK
Medicals government payor billings since October1,
1998, the date Beverly acquired the business unit. Deficiencies
identified by the accounting firm primarily relate to inadequate
documentation supporting Medicare and Medi-Cal claims for
reimbursement for drugs, wheelchairs, and other durable medical
equipment distributed by MKMedical. Specifically, the
review identified instances of missing or incomplete
certificates of medical necessity, treatment authorization
requests, prescriptions and other documentation MK Medical is
required to maintain in order to be entitled to reimbursement
from government payors. Based on the results of the accounting
firms review, we established a reserve in 2002, included
in Other accrued liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets in the amount of $180million to cover
potential overpayments from government payors for the period
from October1, 1998 to 2002. We have advised regulatory
authorities of the results of the accounting firms review.
On September15, 2003, we received a subpoena from the
United States Attorneys Office in Oakland, California,
requesting the production of additional documents relating to MK
Medicals operations and our review of MK Medicals
claims. We have produced documents in response to this subpoena
and continue to cooperate with the governments request for
information. Our liability with respect to this matter could
exceed the reserved amount, which continues to be our best
estimate of our exposure on this matter. We can give no
assurance of the final outcome of this matter or its impact on
our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. eWe are party to various legal matters
relating to patient care, including claims that our services
have resulted in injury or death to residents of our facilities.
Over the past few years, we have experienced an increasing trend
in the number and severity of the claims asserted against us. We
believe that there has been, and will continue to be, an
increase in governmental investigations of long-term care
providers. Adverse determinations in legal proceedings or
governmental investigations, whether currently asserted or
arising in the future, could have a material adverse effect on
us. fThere are various other lawsuits and
regulatory actions pending against the Company arising in the
normal course of business, some of which seek punitive damages
that are generally not covered by insurance. We do not believe
that the ultimate resolution of such other matters will have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 23 Table of Contents

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. General Our business consists principally of providing
healthcare services, including the operation of nursing
facilities, assisted living centers, hospice and home care
centers, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapy services.
We are one of the largest operators of nursing facilities in the
United States. As of December31, 2003, we operated 373
nursing facilities with a total of 39,435 licensed beds. Our
nursing facilities are located in 24states and the
District of Columbia and range in capacity from 24 to 355
licensed beds. As of December31, 2003, we also operated 20
assisted living centers containing 535units, 23 hospice
and home care centers, and 10 outpatient clinics. Our operations
also include rehabilitation therapy services in 36states
and the District of Columbia. Operations and Services Our operations are currently organized into three
primary operating segments: Nursing Facilities, AEGIS and Home
Care. Nursing Facilities.
Our Nursing Facilities
operations provide long-term healthcare and rehabilitation
services through the operation of skilled nursing facilities and
assisted living centers and accounted for approximately 94%, 95%
and 97% of our revenues for the years ended December31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our facilities provide
residents with routine long-term care services, including daily
nursing, dietary, social and recreational services and a full
range of pharmacy services and medical supplies. Our skilled
nursing staff also provides complex and intensive medical
services to residents with higher acuity needs outside the
traditional acute-care hospital setting. We have designed our
assisted living centers to provide residents with a greater
degree of independence while still offering routine services
and, if required, limited medical care. AEGIS. Our AEGIS
segment provides rehabilitation therapy services under contract
to our nursing facilities, as well as 510 third-party nursing
facilities, and accounted for approximately 4%, 3% and 1% of our
revenues for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. AEGIS offers occupational, physical and
speech therapy services designed to maximize function and
independence, assist in recovery from medical conditions and
compensate for remaining disabilities. Home Care. Our Home
Care operations, which accounted for approximately 2% of our
revenues for each of the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, primarily provide hospice services within our
nursing facilities, in facilities operated by other healthcare
providers and in patients homes. Our hospice services
include palliative care for terminally ill patients, as well as
pastoral, counseling and bereavement services for the families
of hospice patients. Governmental Regulation We are subject to extensive regulation by
federal, state and local agencies. Each of our facilities must
comply with regulations regarding staffing levels, patient care
standards, occupational health and safety, patient
confidentiality, billing and reimbursement, as well as
environmental and biological hazards, among others.
Additionally, government agencies have steadily increased their
enforcement activity in this industry over the past several
years, particularly with respect to large for-profit,
multi-facility providers like us. This regulatory environment
may force us to expend considerable resources to ensure
compliance and respond to inspections, investigations or other
enforcement actions. We believe the government will continue
aggressive enforcement in the future. In the ordinary course of business, we
periodically receive notices of deficiencies for allegations of
failure to comply with various regulatory requirements. We
review all such notices and believe we take timely and
appropriate corrective action. In most cases, the facility and
the government will agree upon steps to be taken to bring the
facility into compliance with regulatory requirements. In some
cases or upon repeat violations, the government may take a
number of adverse actions against the facility or us, including
imposition of fines 27 Table of Contents temporary suspension of admission of new
patients, decertification from participation in Medicare or
Medicaid programs and licensure revocation. See Item1.
Business. Critical Accounting Policies The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The
accounting policies discussed below are considered by management
to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements
because their application requires significant judgment and
reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently
uncertain. Certain risks related to these critical accounting
policies are described in the following paragraphs.   
Revenue Recognition, Accounts Receivable
and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts Our revenues are derived primarily from providing
long-term healthcare services. Approximately 80% of our current
revenues is derived from federal and state healthcare programs
primarily Medicare and Medicaid. As discussed more fully in
Item8 Note1, we record revenues when
services are provided at standard charges adjusted to amounts
estimated to be received under governmental programs or other
third-party contractual arrangements based on contractual terms
and historical experience. All providers participating in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial cost
reporting requirements. Federal and state regulations generally
require the submission of annual cost reports covering revenues,
costs and expenses associated with the services provided to
Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. Annual cost
reports are subject to routine audits and retroactive
adjustments. These audits often require several years to reach
the final determination of amounts due to, or by, us under these
programs. As adjustments to recorded revenues become known
or as cost reporting years are no longer subject to audits,
reviews or investigations, the amounts of our revenues and
receivables are revised. Our revenues are reported at their
estimated net realizable amounts, and we believe adequate
provision has been made to reflect any adjustments that could
result from audits of cost reports. However, due to the
complexity of the laws and regulations governing the Medicare
and Medicaid programs, there is at least a possibility that
recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near
term. Changes in estimates related to third party receivables
resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately
$87million and $800,000 for the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and a decrease in
revenues of approximately $20million for the year ended
December31, 2001. Compliance with laws and regulations governing
the Medicare and Medicaid programs is subject to government
review and interpretation, as well as significant regulatory
action including fines, penalties, and possible exclusion from
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, under the
Medicare program, if the federal government makes a formal
demand for reimbursement, even related to contested items,
payment must be made for those items before the provider is
given an opportunity to appeal and resolve the issue. We record bad debt expense monthly as a
percentage of revenue reflecting our historical experience. Each
quarter we adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts according
to the aging and payor mix of the receivables. These adjustments
are based on our weighted average collection experience by payor
type, and recognize the relative risk depending on the source of
the expected payment. Private pay accounts usually represent our
highest collectibility risk. In addition, specific accounts that
are determined to be uncollectible due to bankruptcy,
insufficient documentation, lack of third-party coverage or
financial resources and the like are fully reserved when such
determinations are made. We write-off uncollectible accounts
receivable after all collection efforts have been exhausted and
we determine they will not be collected. If circumstances change
including, but not limited to: economic downturn; higher than
expected defaults or denials; reduced collections; and changes
in our payor mix, our estimates of the recoverability of our
receivables could be reduced by a material amount. Our provisions for bad debts represented 11 28% and 21% of revenues from continuing operations for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Our allowance for doubtful accounts 28 Table of Contents represented approximately 17% and 20% of patient
accounts receivable at December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represented
127% and 121% of accounts over 180days old as of
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accounts
receivable for our Nursing Facilities segment have continued to
decline in 2003, our aging of receivables has improved and our
cash collections continue to be in line with, or ahead of, our
generated revenues. These factors have led to a decrease in our
provision for bad debts and a reduction in our allowance for
doubtful accounts in 2003. We believe adequate provision has
been made for receivables that may prove to be uncollectible.   
Patient Care Liability and Other Insurance
Risks General and professional liability costs for the
long-term healthcare industry have become increasingly expensive
and difficult to estimate. In addition, insurance coverage for
patient care liability and certain other risks, for nursing
facilities specifically and companies in general, has become
increasingly difficult to obtain. When obtained, insurance
carriers are often requiring companies to significantly increase
their liability retention levels and pay substantially higher
premiums for reduced terms of coverage. The majority of our
workers compensation and auto liability risks are insured
through loss-sensitive insurance policies with affiliated and
unaffiliated insurance companies. For our general and
professional liabilities, we are responsible for the first
dollar of each claim, up to a self-insurance limit determined by
the individual policies, subject to aggregate limits in certain
prior policy years. We have purchased insurance for workers
compensation, property, casualty and other risks from numerous
insurance companies. In many cases, the policies provide
coverage for events occurring in specific time frames that may
only be determined in later years. We evaluate our purchased
insurance coverage for risk transfer and believe our
occurrence-based insurance policies have sufficiently
transferred the risk of loss to the insurance carriers we
utilize. As a result, we do not recognize a liability in our
consolidated financial statements for amounts covered by
insurance. We exercise care in selecting companies from
which we purchase insurance, including review of published
ratings by recognized rating agencies, advice from national
brokers and consultants and review of trade information sources.
There exists a risk that any of these insurance companies may
become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to
defend, pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due. In
several prior policy years, losses exceed our self-insurance
aggregate limits. For claims relating to these years, our
insurers have assumed a more significant role in handling the
claims or related obligations and settlements. As a result, it
is more difficult to estimate potential losses in those years.
However, we expect any losses in those years to be covered by
our insurers. Although we believe the companies we have
purchased insurance from are solvent, in light of the dramatic
changes occurring in the insurance industry in recent years, we
cannot assure you that they will remain solvent and able to
fulfill their obligations. Our liabilities for general, professional and
workers compensation risks are estimated by our
independent actuaries twice a year using the most recent trends
of claims, settlements and other relevant data. On an
undiscounted basis, these liabilities totaled
$2037million at December31, 2003. On our financial
statements, these liabilities are discounted at 10% to their
present value using actuarially determined loss payment timing
patterns. The discount rate is based upon our best estimate of
our incremental borrowing rate that would be required to fund
these liabilities with uncollateralized debt. A reduction in the
discount rate by one-half of a percentage point would have
resulted in an additional pre-tax charge of $18million
for the year ended December31, 2003. Based on information
provided by our independent actuaries, we estimate our range of
discounted exposure for these liabilities to be
$1525million to $1794million. At December31,
2003, our recorded reserves for these liabilities totaled
$1599million. We believe adequate provision has been made
in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out
of patient care and other services.   
Asset Impairments We recorded pre-tax asset impairment charges of
$21million, $505million and $1011million
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. We also recorded impairments of goodwill of
$772million in 2002 as the cumulative effect of an
accounting change in accordance with Statement of 29 Table of Contents Financial Accounting Standards No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFASNo142. We evaluate our long-lived
assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist,
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFASNo144.
These indicators of impairment can include, but are not limited
to, the following   
a history of operating losses, with expected
future losses;
changes in the regulatory environment affecting
reimbursement;
decreases in cash flows or cash flow deficiencies;
changes in the way an asset is used in the
business;and
commitment to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose
of an asset.
During 2003, a history of operating losses, with
expected future losses, and cash flow deficiencies led to
impairments on three facilities in our Nursing Facilities
segment. During 2002, changes in the regulatory environment
affecting Medicare reimbursement led to a long-lived asset
impairment analysis on our Nursing Facilities segment. During
2001, continuing operating losses in several of our lines of
business, including certain outpatient clinics, our managed care
contracting entity, certain Home Care businesses and a few of
our nursing facilities, led to impairment analyses on these
assets. These impairment analyses included   
estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by each clinic, unit, facility or property, primarily
over the remaining life of the primary asset;and
reducing the carrying value of the asset to the
estimated fair value when the total estimated undiscounted cash
flows was less than the carrying value of the clinic, unit,
facility or property.
In estimating the undiscounted cash flows for our
nursing facilities, we primarily used our internally prepared
budgets and forecast information, with certain probability
adjustments, including, but not limited to, the following items:
Medicare and Medicaid funding; overhead costs; capital
expenditures; and patient care liability costs. In order to
estimate the fair values of the nursing facilities, we used a
discounted cash flow approach, supplemented by public resource
information on valuations of nursing facility sales transactions
by region of the country. Where the estimated undiscounted cash
flows were negative, we estimated the fair values based on
discounted public resource information, sales values or
estimated salvage value. For other lines of business that lack
significant property investments, we discounted the next five
years of expected cash flows. A substantial decline in the
estimated future cash flows for these facilities or businesses
could materially change the estimated fair values of these
assets, possibly resulting in an additional impairment. In July 2001, SFASNo142 was issued,
which established new rules on the accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets. In accordance with this standard, we
performed the initial screening for potential impairments of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets by reporting unit as of
January1, 2002. We determined the estimated fair values of
each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses, along
with independent source data related to recent transactions.
Based on this determination, we identified potential goodwill
impairments at our former Matrix segment and at Care Focus, a
former reporting unit within our Home Care segment. We engaged a
qualified, independent valuation group to determine the
estimated fair values of each of these reporting units. Their
analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of 2002, and led to
the recording of goodwill impairment charges as the cumulative
effect of an accounting change of $772million as of
January1, 2002, including $706million for Matrix
and $66million for Care Focus. The outpatient therapy
clinic operations and the managed care network of Matrix were
sold during January 2003. The Care Focus unit was sold in June
2003. Based on our annual assessments of all reporting units as
of October1, 2003 and 2002, no additional impairments of
goodwill were identified. 30 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December31, 2003, we had an off-balance
sheet financing arrangement of $700million of medium-term
notes Medium-Term Notes. These notes are
obligations of Beverly Funding Corporation BFC, a
non-consolidated bankruptcy remote, qualifying special purpose
entity. BFCs sole purpose is to acquire, own, hold, and
otherwise administer certain patient accounts receivable
originated and sold to it by certain of our operating
subsidiaries and to issue beneficial interests in those
receivables. Under the terms of the arrangement, certain of our
wholly owned operating subsidiaries groups of nursing
facilities within each state that we operate, which are
separate legal entities, sell Medicaid and Veterans
Administration patient accounts receivable to Beverly Health and
Rehabilitation Services, Inc. BHRS, our wholly
owned operating subsidiary. BFC then purchases these receivables
under a revolving sales structure from BHRS at a discount of 1%.
BFC receives its funding from: 1the issuance of debt to
third-party investors; and 2investments made in BFC by
us. At December31, 2003 and 2002, BFC held
$761million and $1014million, respectively, of net
patient accounts receivable. The decrease in net patient
accounts receivable held by BFC in 2003 from 2002 relates to our
strategic dispositions of nursing facilities and the resulting
reduction in new patient accounts receivable available for BFC
to purchase. In addition to net patient accounts receivable, BFC
also had $255million of cash at December31, 2003. The Medium-Term Notes were issued in June and
July 1999 to third-party investors. The proceeds were used to
redeem $400million of then outstanding medium-term notes
issued by BFC in 1994 that were nearing maturity and to purchase
additional eligible receivables from BHRS. In addition, we
increased our investment in BFC, allowing BFC to purchase
additional eligible receivables to serve as excess collateral
for the new Medium-Term Notes. Under the terms of the
arrangement, BFC is required to maintain receivables and/or cash
in excess of the outstanding balance of the Medium-Term Notes
based on a calculated formula included in the Master Sale and
Servicing Agreement among BHRS, BFC and Beverly Enterprises,
Inc. The Medium-Term Notes mature in 2005; however, according to
the provisions of the notes, principal payments on these
obligations are calculated based on quarterly collections of the
underlying receivables, and are required to begin during the
second quarter of 2004. Based on current collection patterns, we
expect the Medium-Term Notes will be paid off by the third
quarter of 2004. BHRS recognizes a loss at the time the
receivables are sold to BFC equal to the 1% discount and this
loss is included in Other operating and administrative
costs and expenses and in Net cash provided by
operating activities in our consolidated financial
statements. BHRS provides invoicing and collection services
related to the purchased receivables for a market-based
servicing fee. Neither the loss on sale of receivables nor the
servicing fee revenue is material to the Companys results
of operations or cash flows. Prior to June 1999, BFCs assets,
liabilities and operating results were consolidated with us.
However, in June 1999 in connection with the redemption of
previously issued medium-term notes, and issuance of the
Medium-Term Notes in June and July 1999, the Master Sale and
Servicing Agreement was amended so that BFC met the definition
of a qualifying special purpose entity as defined in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No125, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities. Specifically, BFC was no
longer permitted to hold or purchase receivables that originated
prior to January1, 1997 a condition that prevented it
from becoming a qualifying special purpose entity prior to June
1999. We continually evaluate the organizational structure and
operations of BFC to ensure that it remains legally isolated
from us and each of our operating subsidiaries and that it
maintains its status as a qualifying special purpose entity and,
thereby, remains deconsolidated. Our investment in BFC of $313million at
December31, 2003, has been recorded as a current asset in
our consolidated balance sheet. The investment is recorded at
its estimated fair value and is subject to periodic review for
other than temporary impairment. The fair value is determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows of the underlying
receivables purchased and held by BFC at discount rates that
reflect the projected payment terms and the credit risk of the
receivables. We regularly update our fair value analysis for
changes in timing and amount of expected future collections of
the receivables. The carrying value of our investment is written
down when the analysis indicates that the investment is other
than temporarily impaired. Our total investments in BFC have
been adjusted from their initial value of $350million due
to cumulative credit losses 31 Table of Contents incurred by BFC associated with the purchased
receivables since June 1999. We believe the carrying value of
our asset will be fully realized upon the maturity and repayment
of the Medium-Term Notes and collection of the excess
receivables. We monitor this off-balance sheet obligation
throughout the year and believe the obligation and any related
assets should not be included in our consolidated financial
statements under current generally accepted accounting
principles. As of December31, 2003, we have off-balance
sheet debt guarantees of $131million that primarily arose
from our sales of nursing facilities. We also guarantee certain
third-party operating leases. Those guarantees arose from our
dispositions of leased facilities, and the underlying leases
have $360million of minimum rental commitments remaining
through the initial lease terms, with the latest termination
date being February 2019. In accordance with the FASBs
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, we have recorded
approximately $531,000, included in Other accrued
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, as the
estimated fair value of 2003 guarantees. Operating Results   
Reclassification Results of operations for the years ended
December31, 2002 and 2001 reflect asset dispositions
during 2003 as discontinued operations. The following
discussions of 2003 Compared to 2002 and
2002 Compared to 2001 reflect this
reclassification.   
2003 Compared to 2002   
Results of Operations Continuing
Operations We reported net income from continuing operations
for the year ended December31, 2003 of $235million,
compared to a net loss from continuing operations of
$368million for the year ended December31, 2002.
Net income from continuing operations for 2003 included special
pre-tax charges totaling $47million, primarily including   
$21million for asset impairments,
primarily related to three nursing facilities;
$25million for workforce reductions see
below;
$19million for exit costs associated with
our divestiture strategy; net of
$10million reversal of previously recorded
exit costs and $447,000 primarily resulting from the settlement
of a previously impaired asset above carrying value;and
the reversal of $925,000 of costs originally
accrued for the California investigation settlement.
The $25million for workforce reductions
primarily relates to 67 associates who were notified during 2003
that their positions would be eliminated, and included the
following   
$28million of cash expenses,
$18million of which was paid during the year ended
December31, 2003;and
non-cash expenses of approximately $84,000
related to the issuance of 108,230shares under our Stock
Grant Plan the Stock Grant Plan, less
approximately $400,000 due to the cancellation of restricted
stock.
32 Table of Contents We estimate the annual cost savings of this
operational reorganization to be approximately

Net loss from continuing operations for 2002
included pre-tax charges totaling $745million, including
$554million for asset impairments, exit costs and
workforce reductions, $222million for the Florida
insurance reserve adjustment, $63million for the
California investigation settlement, offset by a decrease of
$94million in reserves established in connection with
previous settlements of Federal government investigations. See
2002 Compared to 2001.   
Costs Related to Early Extinguishments of
Debt During the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered
into a $2100million senior credit facility and issued
$1150million of 275%convertible notes. The net
proceeds from these transactions were used to pay off our
9%senior notes and certain mortgages, bonds and other debt
obligations. In conjunction with these transactions, we wrote
off $39million of deferred financing costs related to our
former credit facility, the 9%senior notes and the other
debt obligations. We also paid a prepayment premium of
$27million related to the early extinguishment of the
9%senior notes.   
Gain on Sale of Equity Investment During the fourth quarter of 2003, we sold all of
our holdings in a publicly traded equity security that was
acquired in 1995. This investment had been accounted for as
available for sale, with all changes in fair value being
recorded as comprehensive income. In conjunction with the sale
of the investment, we reversed the accumulated comprehensive
income and recognized a pre-tax gain of $67million.   
Revenues We reported revenues of $1,9970million
during the year ended December31, 2003, compared to
$1,9585million for the same period in 2002. Approximately
94% and 95% of our revenues for each of the years ended
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were derived from
services provided by our Nursing Facilities segment. The
increase in revenues of $385million for the year ended
December31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002,
is due to the following   
an increase of $444million from facilities
we operated during each of the years ended December31,
2003 and 2002 same facility operations;
an increase of $229million from growth in
AEGIS external therapy business;
33 Table of Contents   
an increase of $155million due to a
facility acquisition, the opening of a newly constructed
facility and three hospice and home care centers, and two
start-up businesses; net of
a decrease of $443million due to
dispositions during 2002 not reported as discontinued operations.
The increase in revenues of $444million
from same facility operations for the year ended
December31, 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002,
was primarily due to the following   
$567million due to an increase in Medicaid
and private payment rates;
$93million due to a positive shift in our
patient mix primarily from private to Medicare;
$61million adjustment related to favorable
prior year cost report settlements;
$70million due to an increase in average
daily census in our Home Care segment;
partially offset by a decrease of
$137million in Medicare payment rates. Effective
October1, 2002, certain Medicare add-on payments were
eliminated when the federal government did not pass legislation
to restore the funding. The impact of these eliminations was
partially offset by a 626% increase in Medicare rates effective
October1, 2003;
a decrease of $121million due to a decline
in same facility census;and
$89million due to a decrease in various
other items.
Costs and Expenses We reported costs and expenses of
$1,9103million during the year ended December31,
2003, compared to $1,9329million for the same period in
2002. Excluding special pre-tax charges of $47million in
2003 and $745million in 2002, discussed above, our costs
and expenses increased $472million, consisting of the
following   
an increase of $757million in same
facility operations;
an increase of $120million due to a
facility acquisition, and the opening of a newly constructed
facility and three hospice and home care centers and two
start-up businesses;
partially offset by a decrease of
$405million due to dispositions during 2002 not reported
as discontinued operations.
The increase in costs and expenses of
$757million from same facility operations for the year
ended December31, 2003, as compared to the same period in
2002, was due primarily to the following   
$517million of additional wages and
related expenses primarily due to an increase in our weighted
average wage rate, an increase in nursing hours per patient day
and an increase in associate incentives;
$324million increase in our provision for
insurance and related items, as discussed below;
$57million due to an increase in
contracted services, primarily due to outsourcing certain
housekeeping, laundry and dietary services in our Nursing
Facilities segment;
partially offset by an $182million
decrease in our provision for reserves on accounts and notes
receivable due to improvements in the timing and amount of
collections, as well as the collection of certain accounts that
had previously been fully reserved;and
$37million decrease in depreciation and
amortization expense due to the impact of asset impairments
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Our provision for insurance and related items for
continuing operations increased during 2003, as compared to
2002, primarily due to the following   
an increase in fixed premiums and related costs
for general and professional liability, directors and
officers insurance and workers compensation;
34 Table of Contents   
2002 accruals for patient care liability costs
were low due to aggregate limits on our insurance policies in
place for a portion of 2002. Such aggregate limits were reached
during 2001 due to the sale of our Florida facilities;and
an increase in the actuarial projection of
patient care liability claims.
We adjust our accruals for prior policy-year
patient care and workers compensation liabilities and our
accrual of expected losses for the current year based primarily
on actuarial studies conducted twice per year. Adjustments to
premiums and other costs are recorded as incurred.   
Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of
$84million for the year ended December31, 2003,
including $51million from continuing operations and
$33million from discontinued operations, primarily
related to state income taxes. We decreased our valuation
allowance on our deferred tax assets by $301million
during 2003 to $1691million as of December31, 2003.
This valuation allowance is required under the guidance of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes
SFASNo109 due to our historical
operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses.
Our realization of the deferred tax benefits, primarily
associated with our net operating losses, is dependent upon our
achieving sufficient future pre-tax income. Under federal income
tax regulations, we have up to 20years to generate
sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred benefits.
However, given the size of our pre-tax losses in prior years, a
valuation allowance was considered to be appropriate under the
more stringent accounting standards for the realization of these
deferred tax benefits, which is contingent upon future income in
the near term. At December31, 2003, for income tax
purposes, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of
$932million which expire in years 2018 through 2023;
general business tax credit carryforwards of $377million
which expire in years 2006 through 2023; and alternative minimum
tax credit carryforwards of $213million which do not
expire. Future tax benefits associated with these carryforwards
are not recorded in our 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial
statements as a result of the valuation allowance recorded in
2001.   
Results of Operations Discontinued
Operations The results of operations of disposed facilities,
clinics and other assets during the year ended December31,
2003, as well as the results of operations of held-for-sale
assets, have been reported as discontinued operations for all
periods presented in the consolidated statements of operations.

Includes net interest expense of
$22million and $35million for 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Also includes depreciation and amortization of
$98million and $225million for 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Includes an accrual in 2003 for the purchase of
incremental patient care liability insurance on divested nursing
facilities. Includes an accrual of $10million in 2002 for
legal and related fees associated with the MK Medical estimated
overpayment issue, and asset impairment charges related to
certain nursing facilities and our MK Medical business unit.
We recognized net gains on sales of
$671million in discontinued operations related to
divestitures of 80 nursing facilities and seven assisted living
centers during the year ended December31, 2003. During
2002, we recognized asset impairment charges on 35 of these
divested facilities, amounting to $241million. These
impairments were precipitated by an estimated decline in future
cash flows, primarily associated with Medicare funding
reductions. Of the 35 divested nursing facilities that incurred
impairment charges in 2002, we recognized net losses on sales of
$53million.   
Cumulative Effect of Accounting
Change See 2002 Compared to 2001 for
a discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
for goodwill recorded in 2002 as a result of adopting
SFASNo142. In accordance with
SFASNo142, we completed our annual impairment
assessment of all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets,
including goodwill, as of October1, 2003 with no
additional impairment identified.   
2002 Compared to 2001   
Results of Operations Continuing
Operations We reported a net loss from continuing operations
of $368million for the year ended December31, 2002,
compared to a net loss from continuing operations of
$2750million for the year ended December31, 2001.
The net loss from continuing operations for 2002 included
special pre-tax charges totaling $745million, including   
$554million for asset impairments,
workforce reductions and other unusual items;
$222million for the Florida insurance
reserve adjustment See Costs and Expenses;
$63million for the California
investigation settlement and related costs;
partially offset by a decrease of
$94million in reserves established in conjunction with
previous settlements of federal government investigations.
The $554million for asset impairments,
workforce reductions and other unusual items includes the
following   
$505million write-down of property and
equipment on certain assets of the Nursing Facilities segment;
$85million of workforce reductions see
below;and
$30million adjustment to asset impairments
and approximately $600,000 reversal of workforce reduction
charges recorded in 2001, which were no longer needed.
The net loss from continuing operations for 2001
included special pre-tax charges totaling $2618million,
primarily including $1580million for asset impairments
and exit costs, $242million for workforce reductions and
$775million related to a settlement with the federal
government to resolve open reimbursement issues under the former
cost-reimbursement system for Medicare. The asset impairment and
exit costs, which are included in the consolidated statements of
operations caption Asset impairments, workforce reductions
and other unusual items, relate to   
$751million write-down of Florida
facilities and $551million of Florida exit and other
costs related to a formal plan initiated by management to pursue
the sale of our nursing facility operations in Florida. These
assets were included in the total assets of the Nursing
Facilities segment as of December31, 2001;
36 Table of Contents   
write-down of goodwill of $74million,
property, equipment and other intangible assets of $300,000 and
recording of closing and other costs of $28million on
under-performing Home Care businesses. These assets were
included in the total assets of the Home Care segment as of
December31, 2001;
write-down of property and equipment of
$56million, and goodwill and other intangibles of
$600,000 on certain under-performing nursing facilities. These
assets were included in the total assets of the Nursing
Facilities segment as of December31, 2001;
write-off of abandoned projects and investments
totaling $78million;and
$33million related to the termination of a
lease in Indiana and the write-off of the net book value of the
related assets.
We recorded a special pre-tax charge of
$85million during 2002 for workforce reductions which
were primarily the result of a continuing operational
reorganization required to support the implementation of our
three-year strategic plan. During 2002, we notified 133
employees that their positions would be eliminated. The charge
included the following   
$80million of cash expenses,
$28million and $41million of which was paid during
the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively;and
non-cash expenses of approximately $500,000
related to the issuance of 124,212shares under our Stock
Grant Plan.
We estimate the annual cost savings of this
operational reorganization to be approximately
$112million. During 2001, we recorded special pre-tax charges
totaling $242million for workforce reductions and related
costs, of which $231million related to severance and
other employment agreements for approximately 240 employees who
were notified in 2001 that their positions would be eliminated,
including   
$180million of cash expenses, $271,000,
$49million and $113million of which was paid
during the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively;
non-cash expenses of $45million related to
the issuance of 545,542shares under the Stock Grant
Plan;and
non-cash expenses of $600,000 related to other
long-term incentive agreements.
We estimated the annual costs savings of this
operational reorganization to be approximately
$140million. Much of this savings was realized in 2001,
since the majority of the workforce reductions took place in the
first quarter. These estimated savings are net of the additional
costs we incurred to increase the operations and clinical staff
at the facility and district level. Approximately $600,000 of
these workforce reduction charges in 2001 were reversed during
2002. On February4, 2002, we made a settlement
offer to the federal government to resolve open reimbursement
issues under the former cost-reimbursement system for Medicare.
For accounting purposes, this settlement offer was required to
be recorded in our operating results for the year ended
December31, 2001, and resulted in a pre-tax charge of
$775million which is included in the caption
Special charges and adjustment related to settlements of
federal government investigations. This charge included a
$350million cash settlement and the write-off of
$815million of related cost report receivables, offset by
a $390million reserve established in 1999 for related
issues. This matter was settled with CMS in the fourth quarter
of 2002, and required no increase in accruals previously
recorded.   
Revenues We reported revenues of $1,9585million
during the year ended December31, 2002, compared to
$2,1445million for the same period in 2001. Approximately
95% and 97% of our revenues for each of the years ended
December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were derived from
services provided by our Nursing 37 Table of Contents Facilities segment. The decrease in revenues of
$1860million for the year ended December31, 2002,
as compared to the same period in 2001, consists of the
following   
a decrease of $3212million due to
dispositions, primarily related to our Florida facilities;
partially offset by an increase of
$965million from facilities we operated during each of
the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001 same
facility operations;
an increase of $356million from growth in
AEGIS external therapy business;and
an increase of $31million due to
acquisitions and openings of newly-constructed facilities.
The increase in revenues of $965million
from same facility operations for the year ended
December31, 2002, as compared to the same period in 2001,
was primarily due to the following   
$682million due to an increase in
Medicaid, Medicare and private payment rates;
$83million due to an increase in Medicare
Part B revenues;
$162million due to a positive shift in our
patient mix;
partially offset by a decrease of
$141million due to a decline in same facility census.
Costs and Expenses We reported costs and expenses of
$1,9329million during the year ended December31,
2002, compared to $2,2879million for the same period in
2001. Excluding special pre-tax charges of $745million in
2002 and $2618 in 2001, discussed above, our costs and expenses
decreased $1677million, consisting of the following   
a decrease of $2720million due to
dispositions primarily related to our Florida facilities;
partially offset by an increase of
$969million in same facility operations;and
an increase of $74million due to
acquisitions and openings of newly constructed facilities.
The increase in costs and expenses of
$969million from same facility operations for the year
ended December31, 2002, as compared to the same period in
2001, was due primarily to the following   
$298million of additional wages and
related expenses, primarily due to an increase in our weighted
average wage rate and an increase in nursing hours per patient
day;
$280million additional provision for
reserves on accounts and notes receivable;
$205million due to an increase in
contracted services, primarily due to outsourcing certain
housekeeping, laundry and dietary services in our Nursing
Facilities segment;and
$115million increase in our provision for
insurance and related claims, as discussed below.
Our provision for insurance and related items
increased in 2002 over 2001 primarily due to rising patient care
liability costs. Based on the results of our 2002 mid-year
actuarial study completed in mid-July, we recorded a pre-tax
charge of $433million to increase our reserves for prior
policy year patient care liability costs, including
$222million related to our previously operated Florida
facilities and $211million related to same facility
operations.   
Interest Income and Expense Interest income increased to $47million
for the year ended December31, 2002, as compared to
$29million for the same period in 2001 primarily due to
certain notes receivable accepted as partial consideration for
the sale of our Florida facilities. Interest expense decreased
to $632million for the year ended December31, 2002,
as compared to $750million for the same period in 2001.
This was primarily due to the reduction of debt using the net
proceeds from the sale of our Florida facilities in January 2002. 38 Table of Contents   
Income Taxes We recorded a provision for income taxes of
$61million for the year ended December31, 2002,
primarily related to state income taxes. We increased our
valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by
$455million during 2002 to $1992million as of
December31, 2002. This valuation allowance is required
under the guidance of SFASNo109 due to our
historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net
losses.   
Results of Operations Discontinued
Operations The results of operations of disposed facilities,
clinics and other assets during the year ended December31,
2003, as well as the results of operations of held-for-sale
assets, have been reported as discontinued operations for all

Cumulative Effect of Accounting
Change In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFASNo142, which established new rules
on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets.
Under SFASNo142, goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives are no longer amortized; however, they are
subject to annual impairment tests as prescribed by the
Statement. Intangible assets with definite lives will continue
to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. With respect
to our goodwill and intangible assets, SFASNo142
was effective for us beginning January1, 2002. For 2001,
our goodwill and operating rights amortization was
$39million and $252,000, respectively, net of income
taxes, or $004per share diluted. We completed the impairment assessment of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, during
the first quarter of 2002, with no impairment identified.
SFASNo142 described a two-step process for testing
goodwill for impairment. The first step is a screen for
potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount
of the impairment, if any. Upon completion of the first step of
the goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units,
results indicated that goodwill appeared to be impaired for our
former Matrix and Home Care Services Care Focus
reporting units. We subjected the goodwill at these reporting
units to step two under SFASNo142. 39 Table of Contents We engaged a qualified, independent third-party
to determine the estimated fair value of these two reporting
units. Their valuation was completed during the fourth quarter
of 2002, and the resulting impairment losses amounted to
$706million for Matrix and $66million for Home
Care Services Care Focus. As required by
SFASNo142, these impairment losses were recorded in
the 2002 consolidated statement of operations as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting for goodwill as of
January1, 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources At December31, 2003, we had
$2588million in cash and cash equivalents. We anticipate
$299million of this cash balance, while not legally
restricted, will be utilized primarily to fund certain general
and professional liabilities and workers compensation
claims and expenses. At December31, 2003, we had
$337million of unused commitments under our
$750million revolving credit facility, with utilization
being for standby letters of credit primarily in support of
certain insurance programs, security deposits, and debt or
guaranteed debt obligations. At December31, 2003, we had
positive working capital of $1015million reflected on our
consolidated balance sheet. Our cash flows consisted of the

The decrease in net cash provided by operating
activities of $468million in 2003 from 2002 was primarily
related to a reduction in Medicare funding, an increase in our
insurance and related payments, as well as a decrease in our
incremental cash collections on patient accounts receivable. Our
Nursing Facilities patient accounts receivable have continued to
decline throughout 2003 and our cash collections on these
accounts receivable continue to be in line with, or ahead of,
our generated revenues. However, during 2002 our cash
collections were significantly higher than our generated
revenues due to collections of old patient balances. Having
substantially completed these collection efforts during 2002,
our incremental cash collections returned to a more normalized
amount in 2003. In addition, our patient accounts receivable
increased during 2003 due to certain Medicaid rate increases for
which we will not receive payment until 2004. These factors have
resulted in a year over year decline in the cash generated from
accounts receivable. In 2002, we completed a full evaluation of our
nursing facility portfolio, which included the identification of
non-strategic facilities and facilities that account for a
disproportionately high share of projected patient care
liability costs. As a result of this analysis, we have divested
a significant portion of our nursing facility capacity. During
the year ended December31, 2003, we sold, closed or
terminated the leases on 81nursing facilities, seven
assisted living centers, and one managed facility, of which
72nursing facilities and six assisted living centers were
part of this divestiture strategy. We received net cash proceeds
of $2750million from the sales of these nursing
facilities, our former Matrix outpatient therapy clinics and
managed care network, certain assets of our Home Care segment
and other assets. These net proceeds were primarily used to   
repay approximately $840million of
long-term debt;
pay off $695million of off-balance sheet
lease financing;
fund capital expenditures totaling
$440million;and
increase our cash on hand.
During October 2003, we entered into a new
$2100million senior credit facility the Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility consists of a five-year
$1350million term loan facility and a four-year
$750million revolving credit facility. The revolving
credit facility will be available for general corporate purposes
and up to $550million for the issuance of letters of
credit. The term loan facility is fully drawn and we are
utilizing $413million of the revolving credit facility
for letters of credit. The Credit Facility currently bears
interest at 40 Table of Contents the prime lending rate plus 225%, or the
Eurodollar rate plus 325%, at our option. The Credit Facility
is secured by mortgages on certain nursing facilities, has a
security interest in certain patient accounts receivable, is
guaranteed by substantially all of our present and future
subsidiaries and imposes on us certain financial tests and
restrictive covenants. Concurrent with the Credit Facility transaction,
we issued through a public offering $1150million of
275%convertible subordinated notes due 2033 the
Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are
subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and
future senior debt. The Convertible Notes are convertible into
shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of
$745per share, at the option of the holder when certain
conditions are met prior to maturity. As of December31,
2003, none of the conversion conditions had been met and
therefore, the common shares into which the Convertible Notes
may be converted were not included in the calculation of our
diluted earnings per share. Assuming the Convertible Notes had
been converted into shares of our common stock effective
January1, 2003, our unaudited pro forma diluted net income
per share for the year ended December31, 2003 would have
been reduced by $009per share to $066per share
diluted, based on a total number of shares outstanding of
approximately 122,352,000. The net proceeds from these refinancing
transactions were used as follows   
to redeem all $1800million of our
outstanding 9%Senior Notes due 2006 and to pay the
applicable premium of $27million;
to redeem $310million of our industrial
development revenue and first mortgage bonds;
to repay $186million of our mortgage
obligations;and
to pay transaction fees and expenses and for
general corporate purposes.
These transactions enabled us to extend principal
maturities, invest significantly more capital expenditures for
future growth and reduce our weighted average interest rate by
approximately two percentage points or approximately
$110million in annual interest expense. In November 2003, the Board of Directors
authorized a stock repurchase program whereby we may repurchase,
from time to time on the open market, up to $200million
of our outstanding common stock, effective December1, 2003
and remaining in effect for one year. As of December31,
2003, no shares had been repurchased under this authorization
and any such repurchases will occur during open trading windows,
if at all. We currently have an off-balance sheet financing
arrangement of $700million Medium-Term Notes. These notes
are obligations of BFC. According to the provisions of these
notes, principal payments on these obligations begin in the
second quarter of 2004. We expect these obligations will be paid
off by the third quarter of 2004. Therefore, as of March1,
2004, BFC will no longer purchase receivables from BHRS, but
will only collect previously purchased receivables and use the
proceeds to pay off the Medium-Term Notes and our investment. We
expect the primary impacts on our consolidated balance sheet
will be an increase in patient accounts receivable and an
elimination of our investment inBFC. We expect the successful completion of our
divestiture strategy, while resulting in a significant reduction
in our revenues, will reduce our patient care liability costs,
reduce outstanding debt and strengthen the nursing facility
portfolio going forward. Over the next two years, we expect to
continue the implementation of initiatives to improve our
fundamental business processes and reduce costs by approximately
$400million throughout the organization. We can give no
assurance that we will be able to execute the divestiture
strategy in a timely manner at fair values or that we will be
able to reduce costs to achieve our stated objective within the
time period projected. We currently anticipate that cash on hand, cash
flows from operations and availability under our banking
arrangements will be adequate to repay our debts due within one
year of $134million, to make capital additions and
improvements of approximately $800million, to make
operating lease and other contractual obligation payments, to
make selective acquisitions, including the purchase of
previously leased facilities, to repurchase shares of our common
stock and to meet working capital requirements for the twelve
months 41 Table of Contents ending December31, 2004. If cash flows from
operations or availability under our existing banking
arrangements fall below expectations, we may be required to
utilize cash on hand, delay capital expenditures, dispose of
certain assets, issue additional debt securities, or consider
other alternatives to improve liquidity. Obligations and Commitments A summary of our long-term contractual

For variable-rate debt, we estimated future
interest payments based on published forward yield curve
analyses.
These obligations and commitments do not include
$700million of Medium-Term Notes due March 2005, which
are off-balance sheet obligations of BFC. See
Item8 Note1. As of December31, 2003, we have off-balance
sheet debt guarantees of $131million that primarily arose
from our sales of nursing facilities. We also guarantee certain
third-party operating leases. Those guarantees arose from our
dispositions of leased facilities, and the underlying leases
have $360million of minimum rental commitments remaining
through the initial lease terms, with the latest termination
date being February 2019. We have recorded approximately
$531,000, included in Other accrued liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheet, as the estimated fair value of
2003 guarantees, in accordance with the FASBs
Interpretation No45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. During 2003, we acquired six leased properties
649beds and our corporate office building, which had
been subject to our off-balance sheet lease arrangement, for
cash of $695million. These acquisitions were in
accordance with the 2003 amendments to our former senior credit
facility and our off-balance sheet lease arrangement. These
acquisitions were primarily funded with the proceeds from the
sale of nursing facilities, outpatient therapy clinics and Care
Focus. 42 Table of Contents

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK. We are exposed to market risk because we utilize
financial instruments. The market risks inherent in these
instruments are attributable to the potential loss from adverse
changes in the general level of United States interest rates. We
manage our interest rate risk exposure by maintaining a mix of
fixed and variable rates for debt and notes receivable. The

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS The Board of Directors and Stockholders Beverly Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Beverly Enterprises, Inc. as of
December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Beverly
Enterprises, Inc. at December31, 2003 and 2002, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole
presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein. As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated
financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill.

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   
Basis of Presentation References herein to the Company include Beverly
Enterprises, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. On December31, 2003, we operated 373
nursing facilities, 20 assisted living centers, 23 hospice and
home care centers and 10 outpatient clinics in 26states
and the District of Columbia. Our operations also include
rehabilitation therapy services in 36states and the
District of Columbia. Our consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.   
Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with the 2003 financial statement presentation.
Assets and liabilities held for sale are reported based on their
status as of the balance sheet date.   
Use of Estimates Generally accepted accounting principles require
management to make estimates and assumptions when preparing
financial statements that affect   
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements;and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.
They also require management to make estimates
and assumptions regarding contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits
and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three
months or less.   
Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment is stated at the lower of
carrying value or fair value, or where appropriate, the present
value of the related capital lease obligations less accumulated
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets.

Summary of Significant Accounting
PoliciesContinued In July 2001, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets SFAS No142 was issued, which
established new rules on the accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets. Under SFAS No142, goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized;
however, they are subject to annual impairment tests as
prescribed by the Statement. Intangible assets with definite
lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful
lives. With respect to our goodwill and intangible assets, SFAS
No142 was effective for us beginning January1,
2002. For 2001, our goodwill and operating rights amortization
was $39million and $252,000, respectively, net of income
taxes, or $004per share diluted. In accordance with this standard, we performed
the initial screening for potential impairments of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets by reporting unit as of
January1, 2002. We determined the estimated fair values of
each reporting unit using discounted cash flow analyses, along
with independent source data related to recent transactions.
Based on this determination, we identified potential goodwill
impairments at our former Matrix and Home Care
Services Care Focus reporting units. We engaged a qualified independent valuation
group to determine the estimated fair values of each of these
reporting units. Their valuation analysis was completed in the
fourth quarter of 2002, and led to the recording of a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting for goodwill of
$772million as of January1, 2002, including
$706million for Matrix and $66million for Care
Focus. In accordance with SFAS No142, we test goodwill
for impairment on an annual basis as of October1 for each
of our reporting units. We also test goodwill for impairment,
between annual tests, if an event occurs that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying amount. Based on the October1, 2003 and 2002
analyses, no additional impairments of goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangibles were identified. Following is a summary of our finite-lived
intangible assets and related accumulated amortization, by major
classification, which are included in Other assets

The weighted-average amortization period for
these intangibles is approximately 15years, including
16years for operating rights and licenses and 6years
for leasehold interests. Amortization expense related to these
intangibles for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 was approximately $100,000, $300,000 and $400,000,
respectively. Our estimated aggregate annual amortization
expense for these intangibles for each of the next five years is
approximately $100,000. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value
of our finite-lived intangibles in light of any events or
circumstances that indicate they may be impaired or that the
amortization period may need to be adjusted and make any
necessary adjustments. As of December31, 2003, we do not
believe there are any indications that the carrying values, or
the useful lives, of these assets need to be adjusted. We have
no residual values assigned to our finite-lived intangible
assets. 51 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Summary of Significant Accounting
PoliciesContinued   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
SFASNo144, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets
other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles.
SFASNo144 supersedes Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Of SFASNo121 and
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No30, Reporting
the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions. We
adopted the provisions of SFASNo144 in 2002.
Similar to SFASNo121, SFASNo144
requires impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived
assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are
present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows are not
sufficient to recover the assets carrying amounts. The
impairment loss is measured by comparing the estimated fair
value of the asset, usually based on discounted cash flows, to
its carrying amount. In accordance with SFASNo. 144, we
assess the need for an impairment write-down when such
indicators of impairment are present. See Note5.   
Discontinued Operations SFASNo144 also addresses the
accounting for and disclosure of long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. Under SFASNo144, when a
long-lived asset or group of assets disposal group meets
certain criteria set forth in the Statement, including a
commitment by the Company to a plan to sell the long-lived asset
disposal group within one-year   
the long-lived asset disposal group will be
measured and reported at the lower of its carrying value or fair
value less costs to sell and classified as held for sale on the
consolidated balance sheet;and
the related operations of the long-lived asset
disposal group will be reported as discontinued operations in
the consolidated statement of operations, with all comparable
periods restated.
SFASNo144 also addresses the
accounting for and disclosure surrounding the disposal of
long-lived assets. Our consolidated statements of operations
have been restated for all periods presented to report as
discontinued operations 80 nursing facilities, seven assisted
living centers, our Matrix outpatient therapy clinics, our Care
Focus business unit and certain business units of our Home Care
segment which were disposed of during the year ended
December31, 2003. At December31, 2002, our former
Matrix segment and our MK Medical business unit met the criteria
set forth in SFASNo144 to be classified as held for
sale and reported in discontinued operations. At
December31, 2003, the remaining assets and liabilities of
our former Matrix segment are classified as held for sale. See
Note6.   
Transfers of Financial Assets The Company has an agreement to sell, on an
ongoing basis, certain of its patient accounts receivable
through a revolving sales structure and retains servicing
responsibilities for the transferred receivables. The Company
accounts for the transfers of receivables as sales in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No140,
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities SFASNo.
140. Accordingly, the related patient accounts receivable
are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company, through
its wholly owned subsidiary Beverly Health and Rehabilitation
Services, Inc. BHRS, sold on a revolving basis
certain Medicaid and Veterans Administration VA
patient accounts receivable to a non-consolidated bankruptcy

BHRS provides invoicing and collection services
related to the receivables for a market-based servicing fee.
BHRS recognizes a loss for the 1% discount at the time of sale
which is included in Other operating and administrative
costs and expenses and in Net cash provided by
operating activities in our consolidated financial
statements. BFC has $700million of medium-term notes
the Medium-Term Notes, which are collateralized by
outstanding Medicaid and VA patient accounts receivable
purchased from BHRS. BFC is required to maintain receivables
and/or a cash balance in excess of the outstanding balance of
the Medium-Term Notes, based on a calculated formula in the
Master Sale and Servicing Agreement. Based on ongoing reviews of
BFCs operations, the Company believes that BFC meets the
criteria set forth in SFASNo140, and related
interpretive guidance, to be a QSPE. Therefore, the assets and
liabilities of BFC are not consolidated with Beverly
Enterprises, Inc. At December31, 2003, BFC had total
assets of approximately $1085million, substantially all
of which are pledged as collateral for the Medium-Term Notes.
The assets of BFC cannot be used to satisfy claims of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Medium-Term Notes
currently mature in March 2005; however, according to the
provisions of the notes, principal payments on these
obligations, calculated based on quarterly collections of the
underlying receivables, begin in the second quarter of 2004.
Based on current collection trends, it is expected that these
obligations will be paid off during the third quarter of 2004. At December31, 2003, our investment in BFC
of $313million has been recorded as a current asset in
our consolidated balance sheet. The investment is recorded at
its estimated fair value and is subject to periodic review for
other than temporary impairment. The fair value is determined by
discounting the expected future cash flows of the underlying
receivables purchased and held by BFC at discount rates that
reflect the projected payment terms and the credit risk of the
receivables. We regularly update our fair value analysis for
changes in timing and amount of expected future collections of
the receivables. The carrying value of our investment is written
down when the analysis indicates that the investment is other
than temporarily impaired. Our total investments in BFC have
been adjusted from their initial value of $350million due
to cumulative credit losses incurred by BFC associated with the
purchased receivables since June 1999. We believe the carrying
value of our asset will be fully realized upon the maturity and
repayment of the Medium-Term Notes and collection of the excess
receivables. We monitor this off-balance sheet obligation
throughout the year and believe the obligation and any related
assets should not be included in our consolidated financial
statements under current generally accepted accounting
principles. 53 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Stock-Based Awards On December31, 2002, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure
SFASNo148. SFASNo148
amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFASNo123 to provide alternative
methods of transition for an entity that changes to the fair
value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFASNo148 amends the
disclosure provisions of SFASNo123 and Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No28, Interim Financial
Reporting APB28 to require expanded
disclosure of the effects of an entitys accounting policy
with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported
net income and earnings per share in annual and interim
financial statements and allows companies to continue to use the
intrinsic value method of APB25. We continue to use the intrinsic value method to
account for our stock options. Accordingly, we do not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option grants, which are
issued at fair market value on the date of grant. However, we
recognize compensation expense for our restricted stock grants
at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant over the respective vesting periods on a straight-line
basis. See Note11 for the pro forma effects on our

Summary of Significant Accounting
PoliciesContinued we recognized compensation expense on all
stock-based awards using estimated fair values over the vesting
periods and other disclosures required by SFASNo148.   
Revenues Our revenues are derived primarily from providing
long-term healthcare services. Approximately 80% of our revenues
is derived from federal Medicare and state Medicaid medical
assistance programs. Approximately 56% and 57% of our net
patient accounts receivable at December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, are due from such programs. We record revenues
when services are provided at standard charges adjusted to
amounts estimated to be received under governmental programs and
other third-party contractual arrangements based on contractual
terms and historical experience. These revenues and receivables
are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts and are
subject to audit and retroactive adjustment. Retroactive adjustments are estimated in the
recording of revenues in the period the related services are
rendered. These amounts are adjusted in future periods as
adjustments become known or as cost reporting years are no
longer subject to audits, reviews or investigations. Due to the
complexity of the laws and regulations governing the Medicare
and Medicaid programs, there is at least a possibility that
recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near
term. See Note4 for a discussion of a settlement with the
federal government related to Medicare cost reimbursement issues
and Note10 for the estimated potential overpayment from
government programs resulting from an internal investigation of
our former MK Medical business unit. Excluding these items,
changes in estimates related to third-party receivables resulted
in an increase in revenues of approximately $87million
and $800,000 for the years ended December31, 2003 and
2002, respectively, and a decrease in revenues of approximately
$20million for the year ended December31, 2001. Compliance with laws and regulations governing
the Medicare and Medicaid programs is subject to government
review and interpretation, as well as significant regulatory
action including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, under the
Medicare program, if the federal government makes a formal
demand for reimbursement, even related to contested items,
payment must be made for those items before the provider is
given an opportunity to appeal and resolve the issue.   
Receivables and Concentration of Credit
Risk We have significant accounts receivable and notes
receivable whose collectibility or realizability is dependent
upon the performance of certain governmental programs, primarily
Medicare and Medicaid. These receivables represent our only
concentration of credit risk. We do not believe there are
significant credit risks associated with these governmental
programs. We believe that an adequate provision, based on
historical experience, has been made for the possibility of a
portion of these and other receivables becoming uncollectible
and we continually monitor and adjust these allowances as
necessary. In establishing our estimate of uncollectible
accounts and notes, we consider our historical collection
experience, the aging of the account, and the payor
classification, as well as the collateral value for notes
receivable. Private pay accounts usually represent our highest
collectibility risk. We write-off uncollectible accounts and
notes receivable after all collection efforts have been
exhausted and we determine they will not be collected. Our
allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 17%
and 20% of patient accounts receivable at December31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Certain interest-bearing notes
receivable are placed on a nonaccrual basis when uncertainty
arises as to the collectibility of principal or interest. Notes
receivable of $67million and $95million at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were on a
nonaccrual basis and specific collectibility allowances of
$37million and $69million, respectively, have been
recorded on these nonaccrual notes. 55 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Summary of Significant Accounting
PoliciesContinued   
Income Taxes We follow the liability method in accounting for
income taxes. The liability method requires deferred tax assets
and liabilities to be recorded at currently enacted tax rates
based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting
purposes, referred to as temporary differences. Due to
uncertainties surrounding the generation of sufficient future
income in the near term necessary to realize certain deferred
tax benefits, primarily relating to net operating loss
carryforwards, we have established a full valuation allowance on
our net deferred tax assets. See Note12.   
Comprehensive Income Loss During the fourth quarter of 2003, we sold all of
our holdings in a publicly traded equity security that was
acquired in 1995 for gross proceeds of $85million. This
investment had been accounted for as available for sale, with
all changes in fair value being recorded as comprehensive
income. In conjunction with the sale of the investment, we
reversed accumulated comprehensive income, net of income taxes,
of $512,000 and recognized a pre-tax gain of $67million.
Comprehensive income loss for 2002 includes charges and
credits to stockholders equity not included in net loss.
Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income taxes, of
$517,000 at December31, 2002, primarily consisted of net
unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities of $512,000. During the year ended December31, 2000, we
transferred one of our equity securities from the
available-for-sale category to the trading category. During
2001, this security was sold and we recognized a pre-tax gain of
$256,000 included in Gains on sales of equity
investments on the consolidated statements of operations.

Insurance General and professional liability costs for the
long-term care industry have become increasingly expensive and
difficult to estimate. In addition, insurance coverage for
patient care liability and certain other risks, for nursing
facilities specifically and companies in general, has become
increasingly difficult to obtain. When obtained, insurance
carriers are often requiring companies to significantly increase
their liability retention levels and/or pay substantially higher
premiums for reduced coverage. We exercise care in selecting
companies from which we purchase insurance, including review of
published ratings by recognized rating agencies, advice from
national brokers and consultants and review of trade information
sources. There exists a risk that any of these insurance
companies may become insolvent and unable to fulfill their
obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us when that obligation
becomes due. Although we believe the companies we have purchased
insurance from are solvent, in light of the dramatic changes
occurring in the insurance industry in recent years, we cannot
be assured that they will remain solvent and able to fulfill
their obligations. We believe that adequate provision has been made
in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out
of patient care and related services provided to date. These
provisions are based primarily upon the results of independent

Includes an accrual in 2003 for the purchase of
incremental patient care liability insurance on divested nursing
facilities.
Based on the results of the 2002 mid-year
actuarial study, performed by our independent actuaries, we
recorded a pre-tax charge of $433million related to an
increase in our reserves for prior policy year patient care
liability costs, including $222million attributable to
our previously operated Florida facilities. We completed the
sale of our Florida facilities in January 2002; however, we are
liable for patient care liability claims and other costs for
those facilities through the date of sale, subject to insurance. We insure certain of our auto liability, general
liability, professional liability and workers compensation
risks through various types of loss sensitive insurance policies
with affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies. For our
general and professional liabilities, we are typically
responsible for the first dollar of each claim, up to a
self-insurance limit determined by the individual policies,
subject to aggregate limits for certain policy years. In several
prior policy years, losses exceed our self-insurance aggregate
limits. For claims relating to these years, our insurers have
assumed a more significant role in handling the claims or
related obligations and settlements. As a result, it is more
difficult to estimate potential losses in these years. However,
we expect any losses in those years to be covered by our
insurers. The liabilities for incurred losses retained by
Beverly and not covered by insurance are estimated by the
independent actuaries and are discounted on our financial
statements at 10% to their present value using actuarially
determined loss payment timing patterns. The discount rate is
based upon our best estimate of the incremental borrowing rate
that would be required to fund these liabilities with
uncollateralized debt. A reduction in the discount rate by
one-half of a percentage point 57 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

charge of approximately $18million for the year ended

approximately $2037million and $2242million,
respectively. As of December31, 2003, approximately
$118million in funds the Beverly Indemnity
funds are restricted for the payment of insured claims
and included in Prepaid expenses and other on our
consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we anticipate that
approximately $299million of our existing cash at
December31, 2003, while not legally restricted, will be
utilized primarily to fund certain workers compensation,
general and professional liability claims and expenses. We do
not expect to use this cash for other purposes.

California Investigation Settlement and
Related Costs On August1, 2002, the Company and the State
of California reached an agreement on the settlement of an
investigation by the Attorney Generals office and the
District Attorney of Santa Barbara County of patient care issues
in several California nursing facilities. In accordance with the
terms of the settlement agreement, Beverly
Enterprises California, Inc. entered a plea of
nolo contendere to two felony charges under
Californias Elder Abuse statute and paid a fine of $54,000
related to the plea. In addition, Beverly
Enterprises California, Inc. reimbursed the Attorney
General and the Santa Barbara County District Attorney $533,000
for the costs of their investigations and paid a
$20million civil penalty in four equal, quarterly
installments of $500,000. A Permanent Injunction Permanent
Injunction was entered requiring nursing facilities in
California, operated by subsidiaries of the Company, to comply
with all applicable laws and regulations and conduct certain
training and education programs. The Company recorded a pre-tax
charge against earnings of $63million during the second
quarter of 2002 to reflect the terms of the settlement and
related costs. During the second quarter of 2003, approximately
$925,000 of the reserves related to this settlement were
reversed when it was determined they were no longer required. Certain revisions were made to our Corporate
Integrity Agreement in conjunction with the Permanent Injunction
requiring   
additional training for clinical associates,
contractors and agents who perform services in our California
nursing facilities;and
hiring an independent quality monitor to assess
the effectiveness, reliability and thoroughness of our quality
care systems and our response to quality of care issues in our
nursing facilities in California, Arizona, Hawaii and
Washington. By December31, 2003, we had divested all of
our nursing facilities in Arizona and Washington and a
substantial portion of our nursing facilities in California and
Hawaii.

Special Charge and Adjustment Related to
Settlements with the Federal Government Effective October15, 2002, we entered into
a settlement agreement with the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services CMS, which resolved certain
reimbursement issues relating to: 1costs of services
provided to Medicare patients during 1996 through 1998 under the
federal governments former cost-reimbursement system;
2co-payments due from Medicare beneficiaries, who were
also eligible for Medicaid, for the years 1996 through 2000; and
3all outstanding issues from our Allocation
Investigations see Note10. Under the terms of the
settlement agreement, we paid CMS $350million in November
2002. Because the issues related to this matter arose
prior to December31, 2001 and an offer to settle was made
prior to releasing our 2001 consolidated financial statements,
we reflected a pre-tax charge related to this matter of
$775million in our 2001 results of operations, including   
$350million related to the cash payment to
CMS, which was made in November 2002;
$815million related to the write-off of
Medicare cost report receivables for 1996 through 1998 and
co-payment issues for 1999 and 2000;
partially offset by $390million in
reserves established in conjunction with the Allocation
Investigations see Note10.
In connection with the final settlement with CMS
in 2002, we were able to revise the amount of legal fees and
other costs we originally expected to incur in conjunction with
these settlements. Accordingly, legal and related fees accrued
for these matters in prior years were reduced by
$94million during 2002. The present value of our remaining obligation
under the Civil Settlement Agreement see Note10 is

Asset Impairments During 2003, we recorded asset impairments of
$21million primarily related to the write-down of
property and equipment on three nursing facilities included in
the Nursing Facilities segment, utilizing the same method
described below for 2002. These facilities had a history of
operating losses with expected future losses and cash flow
deficiencies. 59 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and

5.
Asset Impairments, Workforce Reductions and
Other Unusual ItemsContinued During 2002, we recorded asset impairments of
$505million relating to the write-down of property and
equipment on certain assets of the Nursing Facilities segment.
The October1, 2002 elimination of certain funding under
the Medicare program affected the cash flows, and therefore the
fair values, of each of our nursing facilities. This event led
to an impairment assessment on each of our nursing facilities,
including   
estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by each of the facilities over the remaining life of
the primary asset;and
reducing the carrying value of the asset to the
estimated fair value when the total estimated undiscounted
future cash flows was less than the current book value of the
long-lived assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets.
In estimating the undiscounted cash flows for the
2002 impairment assessment, we primarily used our internally
prepared budgets and forecast information, with certain
probability adjustments, including, but not limited to, the
following items: Medicare and Medicaid funding; overhead costs;
capital expenditures; and patient care liability costs. In order
to estimate the fair values of the nursing facilities, we used a
discounted cash flow approach, supplemented by public resource
information on valuations of nursing facility sales transactions
by region of the country. Where the estimated undiscounted cash
flows were negative, we estimated the fair values based on
discounted public resource information, sales values or
estimated salvage values. A substantial change in the estimated
future cash flows for these facilities could materially change
the estimated fair values of these assets, possibly resulting in
an additional impairment. During 2001, we recorded asset impairments of
$1011million, primarily including   
$751million write-down of Florida
facilities, as discussed below. These assets were included in
the total assets of the Nursing Facilities segment as of
December31, 2001;
write-down of goodwill of $74million, and
property, equipment, intangible and other assets of
$13million on under-performing Home Care businesses.
These assets were included in the total assets of the Home Care
segment as of December31, 2001;
write-down of property and equipment of
$56million, and goodwill and other intangibles of
$600,000 on certain under-performing nursing facilities. These
assets were included in the total assets of the Nursing
Facilities segment as of December31, 2001;
write-off of abandoned projects and investments
totaling $78million;and
$33million related to the termination of a
lease in Indiana, including the write-off of net book value of
the related assets.
The asset impairment analyses on our
under-performing units and facilities in 2001 included   
estimating the undiscounted cash flows to be
generated by each unit or facility, primarily over the weighted
average remaining life of the assets;and
reducing the carrying value of the assets to the
estimated fair value when the total undiscounted cash flows was
less than the carrying value of the unit or facility.
In order to estimate the fair values of the unit,
facility or property for the 2001 impairment assessment, we used
a discounted cash flow approach. For the nursing facilities, we
discounted the estimated future cash flows over the remaining
life of the primary asset. For the Home Care businesses that
lacked significant property investments, we discounted the next
10years of expected cash flows. Cash flows for all lines
of business were estimated using historical results, without an
inflation factor, and adjusted for known trends. 60 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and

Asset Impairments, Workforce Reductions and
Other Unusual ItemsContinued Those cash flows were discounted at our weighted
average cost of capital. A one percent change in the discount
rate would not have had a material impact on the impairment
calculations. Where the cash flows were negative, we estimated
the fair values based on our knowledge of recent or pending
sales of comparable businesses. During 2001, a formal plan was initiated by
management to pursue the sale of our nursing home operations in
Florida, which included 49 nursing facilities and four assisted
living centers the Florida facilities. The plan
included the pursuit of the sale of one additional nursing
facility in Florida and certain other assets which would be sold
in separate transactions. The decision to sell these properties
was made primarily due to the disproportionately high patient
care liability costs that we had been incurring in the state of
Florida. Accordingly, the property and equipment, identifiable
intangibles and operating supplies of our Florida nursing home
operations were considered assets held for sale. Management
estimated the fair value less selling costs of such assets and
took special pre-tax charges in 2001 totaling $751million
to write-down the Florida assets. Effective December1,
2001, we entered into a lease agreement on the Florida
facilities with Florida Health Care Properties and we closed the
real estate sale in January 2002, with no further gain or loss.
Annualized revenues for the Florida facilities were
approximately $2880million. During the year ended
December31, 2001, our Florida nursing home operations
recorded pre-tax income of approximately $600,000.   
Workforce Reductions During 2003, we recorded $25million for
workforce reductions primarily relating to 67associates
who were notified during 2003 that their positions would be
eliminated, and included the following   
$28million of cash expenses,
$18million of which was paid during the year ended
December31, 2003;and
non-cash expenses of approximately $84,000
related to the issuance of 108,230shares under our Stock
Grant Plan the Stock Grant Plan, less
approximately $400,000 due to the cancellation of restricted
stock.
During 2002, we recorded $79million for
workforce reductions, which included a charge of approximately
$85million for 133 associates who were notified in 2002
that their positions would be eliminated, net of a $600,000
reversal of workforce reduction charges recorded in 2001 which
were no longer needed. The $85million pre-tax charges
included the following   
$80million of cash expenses, approximately
$28million and $41million of which was paid during
the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002;and
non-cash expenses of $500,000 related to the
issuance of 124,212shares under our Stock Grant Plan.
In January 2001, we implemented a new three-year
strategic plan and operationally reorganized our business. As a
result of this operational reorganization, we recorded special
pre-tax charges totaling approximately $242million during
2001. Approximately $231million of these pre-tax charges
related to severance and other employment agreements for
approximately 240 associates who were notified in 2001 that
their positions would be eliminated, including   
$180million of cash expenses,
approximately $271,000, $49million and $113million
of which was paid during the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively;

Discontinued Operations During the fourth quarter of 2002, a formal plan
was approved by our Board of Directors to pursue the sale of our
Matrix segment and MK Medical business unit. The decision to
sell these non-strategic assets was made primarily to allow us
to further reduce our debt level and to reinvest in facilities,
technology and other business opportunities consistent with our
strategic objectives. During 2002, in accordance with
SFASNo144, the assets and liabilities of our former
Matrix segment, the assets of our MK Medical business unit, and
certain non-strategic assets of our Nursing Facilities segment
were reclassified to the corresponding held for sale
asset and liability line items in the 2002 consolidated balance
sheet. The outpatient therapy clinics and managed care network
of Matrix, the MK Medical business unit, and certain
non-strategic assets of our Nursing Facilities segment were sold
during 2003. We continue to actively market the remaining Matrix
assets and expect to dispose of them within the next six months. 62 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Includes net interest expense of
$22million, $35million and $42million for
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Also includes depreciation
and amortization of $98million, $225million and

facilities. Includes an accrual of $10million in 2002 for
legal and related fees associated with the MK Medical estimated
overpayment issue, and asset impairment charges in 2002 and 2001
related to certain nursing facilities, our former Matrix segment
and our MK Medical business unit.
We recognized net gains on sales of
$671million related to divestitures of 80 nursing
facilities and seven assisted living centers during the year
ended December31, 2003. During 2002, we recognized asset
impairment charges on 35 of these divested facilities, amounting
to $241million. These impairments were precipitated by an
estimated decline in future cash flows, primarily associated
with Medicare funding reductions. Of the 35 divested nursing
facilities that incurred impairment charges in 2002, we
recognized net losses on sales of $53million.   
7.
Acquisitions and Dispositions During the year ended December31, 2003, we
acquired the remaining six leased properties 649beds and
our corporate office building, which had been subject to our
off-balance sheet lease arrangement, for cash of
$695million. These acquisitions were in accordance with
amendments made in 2003 to our former credit facility and our
off-balance sheet lease arrangement. The acquisitions were
primarily funded with the proceeds from the sales of nursing
facilities, our outpatient rehabilitation clinics and Care
Focus. We also entered into an operating lease on a nursing
facility 140beds and purchased certain other assets for
cash of approximately $400,000 plus closing and other costs.
Excluding discontinued operations during 2003 see Note6,
we closed one nursing facility 94beds, sold one
non-operational nursing facility 120beds and certain
other assets for $76million, including cash and a
$41million note receivable. We recognized net pre-tax
gains of $400,000 during the year ended December31, 2003,
included in Net gains on dispositions on the
consolidated statements of operations, as a result of these
disposal activities. These dispositions did not meet the
criteria in SFASNo144 to be included in
discontinued operations. During the year ended December31, 2002, we
sold, closed or terminated the leases on 69nursing
facilities 8,132beds, four assisted living centers

Acquisitions and
DispositionsContinued consolidated statements of operations, as a
result of these disposal activities. The majority of these
disposed assets were classified as held for sale at
December31, 2001 and, therefore, did not meet the criteria
for classification as discontinued operations. During the year ended December31, 2001, we
acquired one nursing facility 185 beds, eight previously
leased nursing facilities 903 beds and certain other assets
for cash of approximately $37million, assumed debt of
approximately $184million, security deposits of $200,000
and incurred closing and other costs of approximately $300,000.
These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. Also during
such period, we sold, closed or terminated the leases on 18
nursing facilities 1,768 beds, one assisted living center
12units, three outpatient therapy clinics, one home care
center and certain other assets for cash proceeds of
approximately $204million and a note receivable of
approximately $39million. We did not operate three of the
nursing facilities 355 beds which had been leased to other
nursing home operators. We recognized net pre-tax gains of
$700,000 during the year ended December31, 2001, included
in Net gains on dispositions on the consolidated
statements of operations, as a result of these dispositions. In
addition, we terminated the lease on one nursing facility 223
beds in Indiana and recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately
$33million which was included in the consolidated
statements of operations caption Asset impairments,
workforce reductions and other unusual items.

During October 2003, we entered into a new
$2100million senior credit facility the Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility consists of a five-year
$1350million term loan facility and a four-year
$750million revolving credit facility. The revolving
credit facility will be available for general corporate purposes
and up to $550million for the issuance of letters of
credit. The term loan facility is fully drawn and we are
utilizing $413million of the revolving credit facility
for letters of credit at December31, 2003. The Credit
Facility currently bears interest at the prime lending rate plus
225%, or the Eurodollar rate plus 325%, at our option. These
rates may be adjusted quarterly based on the senior secured
leverage ratio calculation. The revolving credit facility is
secured by first priority liens on 79 nursing facilities 5,950

Long-term
DebtContinued guaranteed by substantially all of our present
and future subsidiaries and imposes on us certain financial
tests and restrictive covenants. Concurrent with the Credit Facility transaction,
we issued through a public offering $1150million of
275%convertible subordinated notes due 2033 the
Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are
subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and
future senior debt. The Convertible Notes are convertible into
shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of
$745per share, at the option of the holder, if any of the
following conditions are met   
during any fiscal quarter, if the market price of
our common stock is at least $894 for at least 20 consecutive
trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending
on the last day of the preceding fiscal quarter;
during the five business day period following any
10 consecutive trading day period in which athe trading
price of a note for each day of such period is less than 105% of
the conversion value and bthe conversion value for each
day of such period is less than 95% of the principal amount of a
Convertible Note;
if we call the Convertible Notes for
redemption;or
upon the occurrence of certain corporate
transactions specified in the agreement.
As of December31, 2003, none of the
conversion conditions had been met and, therefore, the common
shares into which the Convertible Notes may be converted were
not included in the calculation of our diluted earnings per
share. Assuming the Convertible Notes had been converted into
shares of our common stock effective January1, 2003, our
unaudited pro forma diluted net income per share for the year
ended December31, 2003, would have been reduced by
$009per share to $066per share diluted, based on a
total number of shares outstanding of approximately 122,352,000. The net proceeds from these transactions were
used as follows   
to redeem all $1800million of our
outstanding 9%Senior Notes due 2006 and to pay the
applicable premium of $27million;
to redeem $310million of our industrial
development revenue and first mortgage bonds;
to repay $186million of our mortgage
obligations;and
to pay transaction fees and expenses, and for
general corporate purposes.
The 95/8%Senior Notes are unsecured
obligations guaranteed by substantially all of our present and
future subsidiaries the Subsidiary Guarantors and
impose on us certain restrictive covenants. Separate financial
statements of the Subsidiary Guarantors are not considered to be
material to holders of our Senior Notes since the guaranty of
each of the Subsidiary Guarantors is joint and several and full
and unconditional except that liability thereunder is limited
to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would
not render its obligations thereunder subject to avoidance under
Section548 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended, or
any comparable provisions of applicable state law, and Beverly

Contingencies Continued 2006 $25million;
2007 $762,000. We incurred approximately
$23million, $29million and $34million under
this agreement during the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. We are contingently liable for approximately
$131million of long-term debt maturing on various dates
through 2019, as well as annual interest. These contingent
liabilities principally arose from our sale of nursing
facilities and assisted living centers. We operate two
facilities related to approximately $28million of the
principal amount for which we are contingently liable, pursuant
to long-term agreements accounted for as operating leases. We
guarantee certain third-party operating leases. These guarantees
arose from our dispositions of leased facilities and the
underlying leases have approximately $360million of
minimum rental commitments remaining through the initial lease
terms, with the latest termination date being February 2019. In
accordance with the FASBs Interpretation No45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others FIN45, we have recorded
approximately $531,000, included in Other accrued
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, as the
estimated fair value of 2003 guarantees. In 2002, we notified federal and California
healthcare regulatory authorities CMS, Office of Inspector
General the OIG, the California Attorney
Generals office and the California Department of Health
of our intent to conduct an internal investigation of past
billing practices relating to MKMedical, our former
medical equipment business unit based in Fresno, California. An
independent accounting firm has reviewed MKMedicals
government payor billings since October1, 1998, the date
Beverly acquired the business unit. Deficiencies identified by
the accounting firm primarily relate to inadequate documentation
supporting Medicare and Medi-Cal claims for reimbursement for
drugs, wheelchairs, and other durable medical equipment
distributed by MKMedical. Specifically, the review
identified instances of missing or incomplete certificates of
medical necessity, treatment authorization requests,
prescriptions and other documentation MKMedical is
required to maintain in order to be entitled to reimbursement
from government payors. Based on the results of the accounting
firms review, we established a reserve in 2002, included
in Other accrued liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets in the amount of $180million to cover
potential overpayments from government payors for the period
from October1, 1998 to 2002. We have advised regulatory
authorities of the results of the accounting firms review.
On September15, 2003, we received a subpoena from the
United States Attorneys Office in Oakland, California,
requesting the production of additional documents relating to
MKMedicals operations and our review of MK
Medicals claims. We have produced documents in response to
this subpoena and continue to cooperate with the
governments request for information. Our liability with
respect to this matter could exceed the reserved amount, which
continues to be our best estimate of our exposure on this
matter. We can give no assurance of the final outcome of this
matter or its impact on our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. On February3, 2000, we entered into a
series of separate agreements with the U.S.Department of
Justice and the OIG. These agreements settled the federal
governments investigations of the Company relating to our
allocation to the Medicare program of certain nursing labor
costs in our skilled nursing facilities from 1990 to 1998 the
Allocation Investigations. Under the Civil Settlement Agreement, we paid the
federal government $250million during 2000 and are
reimbursing the federal government an additional
$1450million through withholdings from our biweekly
Medicare periodic interim payments in equal installments through
the first quarter of 2008. The present value of the remaining
obligation included as liabilities on our consolidated balance
sheets was $619million and $739million at
December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, we
agreed to resubmit certain Medicare filings to reflect reduced
labor costs allocated to the Medicare program. The adjustments
for these resubmitted filings were part of the settlement
agreement with CMS. See Note4. 69 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Contingencies Continued Under the Corporate Integrity Agreement, we are
required to monitor, on an ongoing basis, our compliance with
the requirements of the federal healthcare programs. This
agreement addresses our obligations to ensure that we comply
with the requirements for participation in the federal
healthcare programs. It also includes functional and training
obligations, audit and review requirements, recordkeeping and
reporting requirements, as well as penalties for breach or
noncompliance of the agreement. We believe that we are generally
in compliance with the requirements of the Corporate Integrity
Agreement. On October31, 2002, a shareholder
derivative action entitled Paul Dunne and Helene Dunne,
derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Beverly Enterprises,
Inc.v. Beryl F. Anthony, Jr., etal. was filed in
the Circuit Court of Sebastian County, Arkansas, FortSmith
Division No.CIV-2002-1241. This case was purportedly
brought derivatively on behalf of the Company against various
current and former officers and directors. The complaint alleges
causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty against the
defendants based on: 1allegations that defendants failed
to establish and maintain adequate accounting controls such that
the Company failed to record adequate reserves for patient care
liability costs; and 2allegations that certain
defendants sold Company stock while purportedly in possession of
material non-public information. On May16, 2003, two additional derivative
complaints Holcombev. Floyd, etal. and
Flowersv. Floyd, etal. were filed and
subsequently transferred to the Circuit Court of Sebastian
County, Arkansas, FortSmith Division and consolidated with
the Dunne action as Holcombv. Beverly Enterprises,
Inc. The Dunnes were subsequently dismissed as plaintiffs.
On June9, 2003, pursuant to a stipulation of the parties,
the Court entered a scheduling order providing, among other
things, that plaintiffs will have thirty days from a ruling on
the motion to dismiss filed by defendants in the related
securities class action in federal court, In re Beverly
Enterprises, Inc. Securities Litigation Case No2:02
cv2190, to file an amended complaint and that defendants
shall have thirty days thereafter to respond to the complaint.
The court entered a ruling on the defendants motion to
dismiss in the federal securities class action on
December23, 2003, and the plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal on January22, 2004. In light of the
plaintiffs appeal, the parties have agreed to a further
stay of this derivative action pending resolution of the appeal.
Due to the preliminary state of this action, we are unable to
assess the probable outcome of the case and can give no
assurance of the ultimate impact on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. On August16, 2002, August26, 2002,

No02-2193 and Charles Krebsv. Beverly
Enterprises, Inc., etal. CIV. No02-2222 were
filed in the United States District Court, Western District of
Arkansas, FortSmith Division. These cases were filed as
purported securities fraud class actions under
Sections10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule10b-5 promulgated thereunder. These cases separately name Beverly Enterprises,
Inc. as a defendant along with various current officers and our
independent auditors. In all three cases, the purported class
period runs from October16, 2000 to and including
July19, 2002. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants, during
the purported class period, made multiple false and misleading
statements. In early March 2003, these cases were consolidated
as InreBeverly Enterprises, Inc. Securities
Litigation. On April30, 2003, plaintiffs filed an
amended complaint. On May30, 2003, the defendants filed a
motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Briefing on the motion
to dismiss was completed July11, 2003. The court heard
oral arguments on the defendants motion on August28,
2003. On December23, 2003, the court granted
defendants motions to dismiss with prejudice and denied
plaintiffs motion to amend the complaint. Plaintiffs filed
a notice of appeal on January22, 2004. Due to the
preliminary state of this action, the Company is unable to
assess the probable outcome of the case. We can give no 70 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 10.Commitments and
Contingencies Continued assurances of the ultimate impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows as a result of this proceeding. In addition, since July29, 1999, several
derivative lawsuits have been filed in the state courts of
Arkansas, California and Delaware, as well as the federal
district court in Arkansas, assertedly on behalf of the Company
collectively, the Derivative Actions. Due to the
preliminary state of these actions and the fact the complaints
do not allege damages with any specificity, we are unable to
assess the probable outcome of the cases or the materiality of
the risk of loss. We believe that plaintiffs allegations
that the defendants acted unlawfully are without merit and the
defendants will vigorously defend the Derivative Actions.
However, we can give no assurances of the ultimate impact on our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are party to various legal matters relating to
patient care, including claims that our services have resulted
in injury or death to residents of our facilities. We have
experienced an increasing trend in the number and severity of
the claims asserted against us. See Note2. We believe
that there has been, and will continue to be, an increase in
governmental investigations of long-term care providers. Adverse
determinations in legal proceedings or governmental
investigations, whether currently asserted or arising in the
future, could have a material adverse effect on us. There are various other lawsuits and regulatory
actions pending against the Company arising in the normal course
of business, some of which seek punitive damages that are
generally not covered by insurance. We do not believe that the
ultimate resolution of such other matters will have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

Stockholders Equity We have 300,000,000shares of authorized
$10par value common stock. We are subject to certain
restrictions under our long-term debt agreements related to the
payment of cash dividends on, and the repurchase of, our common
stock. During 2003 and 2002, we did not pay any cash dividends
on, or repurchase any of, our common stock. We have
25,000,000shares of authorized $1par value preferred
stock, all of which remains unissued. The Board of Directors has
authority, without further stockholder action, to set rights,
privileges and preferences for any unissued shares of preferred
stock. In November 2003, the Board of Directors
authorized a stock repurchase program whereby we may repurchase,
from time to time on the open market, up to $200million
of our outstanding common stock, effective December1, 2003
and remaining in effect for one year. As of December31,
2003, no shares had been repurchased under this authorization
and any such repurchases will occur during open trading windows,
if atall. In April 2003, we issued 25million shares
of restricted stock to certain officers and other employees.
These shares vest one-third per year over the three years
following the grant date. These restricted stock grants were
made, along with certain cash incentives, as part of a program
designed to retain key associates. If these additional shares
had been issued prior to January1, 2003, there would have
been no material impact on the Companys net income per
share for the year ended December31, 2003. We recognize
compensation expense for our restricted stock grants at the fair
market value of our common stock on the date of grant, amortized
over the respective vesting periods on a straight-line basis.
The total charges to our consolidated statements of operations
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
related to restricted stock grants were approximately
$18million, $13million and $17million,
respectively. In January 2001, we filed a registration
statement under FormS-8 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission registering 1,174,500shares of our common
stock. These shares were previously repurchased by 71 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

issued under the Beverly Enterprises, Inc. Stock Grant Plan the
Stock Grant Plan to holders of restricted stock
who, by virtue of the terms of their employment contracts,
severance agreements or other similar arrangements, are entitled
to the immediate vesting of their restricted stock. In
conjunction with ongoing operational reorganizations as
discussed in Note5, 777,984shares of our common
stock under the Stock Grant Plan have been issued to various
officers in exchange for shares of restricted stock held by
them, which have been cancelled. Pre-tax workforce reduction
charges of $84,000, $500,000 and $45million were recorded
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in connection with the
issuance of these shares. During 1997, the New Beverly 1997 Long-Term
Incentive Plan was approved the 1997 Long-Term Incentive
Plan. The plan became effective December3, 1997 and
remains in effect until December31, 2006, subject to early
termination by the Board of Directors. The Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors the Committee
is responsible for administering the 1997 Long-Term Incentive
Plan and has complete discretion in determining the number of
shares or units to be granted, in setting performance goals and
in applying other restrictions to awards, as needed, under the

authorized to issue 10,000,000shares of our common stock,
subject to certain adjustments, in the form of nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
awards, bonus stock and other stock unit awards. In May 2001,
our stockholders approved an amendment to this plan which
authorized the issuance of an additional 5,000,000shares. In general, nonqualified and incentive stock
options must be granted at a purchase price equal to the fair
market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Options
issued at fair market value do not currently require the
recording of compensation expense upon issuance. Options shall
be exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions
and conditions as the Committee shall determine and expire no
later than 10years from the grant date. Stock appreciation
rights may be granted alone, in tandem with an option or in
addition to an option. Stock appreciation rights shall be
exercisable at such times and be subject to such restrictions
and conditions as the Committee shall determine and expire no
later than 10years from the grant date. Restricted stock
awards are outright stock grants which have a minimum vesting
period of one year for performance-based awards and three years
for other awards. Performance awards, bonus stock and other
stock unit awards may be granted based on the achievement of
certain performance or other goals and will carry certain
restrictions, as defined. The issuance of restricted stock and
other stock awards usually require the recognition of
compensation expense measured by the fair value of the stock on
the date of grant. During 1997, the New Beverly Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan was approved the Non-Employee
Directors Stock Option Plan. The plan became effective
December3, 1997 and remains in effect until
December31, 2007, subject to early termination by the
Board of Directors. We have 450,000shares of our common
stock authorized for issuance, subject to certain adjustments,
under the Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. The
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan was amended by the
Board of Directors on March28, 2001, to provide that each
non-employee director be granted an option to purchase
11,000shares of our common stock on June1 of each
year until the plan is terminated, subject to the availability
of shares. These options are granted at a purchase price equal
to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of
grant, become exercisable one year after the date of grant and
expire 10years after the date of grant. 72 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and

Continued SFASNo148, issued on
December31, 2002, provides companies alternative methods
of transitioning to SFASNo123s fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation, and
amends certain disclosure requirements. SFASNo148
does not mandate fair value accounting for stock-based employee
compensation, but does require all companies to meet the
disclosure provisions. We currently do not recognize
compensation expense for our stock option grants, which are
issued at fair market value on the date of grant, and are
accounted for under the intrinsic value method. We are in
compliance with the current accounting rules surrounding
stock-based compensation. The Board of Directors and management
are carefully reviewing and considering the expensing of stock
options in our consolidated statements of operations. Currently,
we believe that adopting fair value accounting for stock options
would be premature since the accounting standard setters, both
in the United States and internationally, are expected to revise
the stock option accounting rules in 2004. Pro forma information regarding net income loss
and diluted net income loss per share has been determined as
if we accounted for our stock option grants under the fair
market value method described in SFASNo123. The
fair market value of our stock options was estimated at the date
of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions for the years ended
December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively   
risk-free interest rates of 30%, 48% and 43        
volatility factors of the expected market price
of our common stock of 81, 74 and 59;and
expected option lives of five years.
We do not currently pay cash dividends on our
common stock and no future dividends are currently planned. The
weighted-average assumptions resulted in a weighted average
estimated fair market value of options granted during 2003, 2002
and 2001 of $261per share, $355per share and
$425per share, respectively. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair market value of traded
options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected
stock price volatility. Because our stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair market value estimates, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair market
value of our stock options. 74 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

amortized to expense over their respective vesting periods. The
pro forma effects are not necessarily indicative of the effects

Purchase Plan as amended and restated enables all full-time

purchase shares of our common stock at the current market price
through payroll deductions. Effective January1, 2003, we
eliminated our matching contributions to this plan. Each
participant specifies the amount to be withheld from earnings
per pay period, subject to certain limitations. During 2002 and
2001 we matched 15% of each participants contribution. The
total charges to our consolidated statements of operations for

Fair Values of Financial Instruments Financial Accounting Standards Statement
No107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, SFASNo107 requires
disclosure of fair value information about financial
instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for
which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.
Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions
used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash
flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot
be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in
many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument. SFASNo107 excludes certain financial
instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure
requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts
presented do not represent our underlying value. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of
our financial instruments at December31, 2003 and 2002 are

At December31, 2003 and 2002, we had
outstanding defeased long-term debt with aggregate carrying
values of $63million and $46million, respectively.
The fair value of such defeased debt was approximately
$64million and $46million at December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair value was estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on our incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. In order to consummate certain dispositions and
other transactions, we have agreed to guarantee the debt assumed
or acquired by the purchaser or the performance under a lease,
by the lessee. In accordance with FIN45, we have recorded
approximately $531,000, included in Other accrued
liabilities on the 2003 consolidated balance sheet, as the
estimated fair value of 2003 guarantees. We used the following methods and assumptions in
estimating our fair value disclosures for financial instruments   
Cash and Cash Equivalents The carrying amount reported in the consolidated
balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximates its
fair value.   
Notes Receivable, Net Including Current
Portion For variable-rate notes that reprice frequently
and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are
based on carrying values. For fixed-rate notes, the fair values
are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using
interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar
terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 77 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Federal Government Settlements Including
Current Portion The present value of our obligations to the
federal government resulting from the settlements of the
Allocation Investigations is included in the consolidated
balance sheet captions Federal government settlement
obligations and Other liabilities and deferred
items. These obligations are non-interest bearing, and as
such, were imputed at their approximate fair market rate of 9%
for accounting purposes. The carrying amounts of these
obligations approximate their fair values.

Segment Information Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, provides disclosure guidelines for
segments of a company based on a management approach to defining
operating segments.   
Description of the Types of Services from
which each Operating Segment Derives its Revenues Our operations are currently organized into three
primary segments   
Nursing Facilities,
which provide long-term healthcare
through the operation of skilled nursing homes and assisted
living centers;
AEGIS, which
provides rehabilitation therapy services under contract to our
nursing facilities and third-party nursing facilities;and
Home Care, which
primarily provides hospice services.
Measurement of Segment Income or Loss and
Segment Assets The accounting policies of the operating segments
are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies see Note1. We evaluate financial
performance and allocate resources primarily based on income or
loss from operations before income taxes, excluding any unusual
items.   
Factors Management Used to Identify Our
Operating Segments Our operating segments are strategic business
units that offer different services within the healthcare
continuum. Business in each operating segment is conducted by
one or more corporations. The corporations comprising each
operating segment also have separate boards of directors. 78 Table of Contents BEVERLY ENTERPRISES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

We recorded provisions for income taxes,
including taxes allocated to discontinued operations, at 95%
and 4% for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, primarily due to state income taxes. The operations of Matrix, MK Medical, Care Focus,
80nursing facilities and seven assisted living centers
have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods
presented since they met the criteria under
SFASNo144 and therefore, the results above differ
from amounts previously reported in our Form10-Qs. In
addition, we recorded a cumulative effect for the change in
accounting for goodwill as of January1, 2002, which had
not been included in the first quarter 2002 Form10-Q. 81 Table of Contents

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures which are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act
reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
Such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the
Companys management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives, and the Companys management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by SEC Rule13a-15b, the
Company has carried out an evaluation as of December31,
2003, the end of the period covered by this report, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the
foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. There has been no change in the Companys
internal controls over financial reporting during the
Companys most recent fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. 82 Table of Contents PARTIII
