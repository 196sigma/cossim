MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
Management of ADTRAN, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules
13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADTRAN;
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADTRAN are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADTRAN; and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ADTRANs assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of ADTRANs internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that ADTRAN maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2008. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To Board of Directors and Stockholders of ADTRAN, Inc.: In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of ADTRAN, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2007.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Birmingham, Alabama February26, 2009

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ADTRAN, Inc. designs, manufactures,
markets and services network access solutions for communications networks. Our solutions are widely deployed by providers of telecommunications services serviced by our Carrier Networks Division, and small and mid-sized businesses and enterprises
serviced by our Enterprise Networks Division, and enable voice, data, video and Internet communications across copper, fiber and wireless networks. Many of these solutions are currently in use by every major United States service provider and many
global ones, as well as by many public, private and governmental organizations worldwide. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements include ADTRAN and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and
cash equivalents represent demand deposits, money market funds, and short-term investments classified as available for sale with original maturities of three months or less. We maintain depository investments with certain financial institutions.
Although these depository investments may exceed government insured depository limits, we have evaluated the credit worthiness of these applicable financial institutions, and determined the risk of material financial loss due to exposure of such
credit risk to be minimal. As of December31, 2008, $201 million of our cash and cash equivalents, primarily certain domestic money market funds and foreign depository accounts, were in excess of government provided insured depository limits.
The Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program adopted during 2008 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides full coverage of our domestic depository accounts through December 2009. Financial Instruments The carrying amounts reported in the
consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for bonds payable
was $488 million compared to an estimated fair value of $444 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard Poors credit rating of AA. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations. These investments consist of municipal variable rate demand notes and municipal auction rate securities. We have held no municipal auction rate securities since February7, 2008.
Variable rate demand notes are designed to be marketed as money market instruments. These instruments interest rates reset on a seven, 28 or 35 day basis to maintain the price of the instruments at par. At December31, 2008, our municipal
variable rate demand notes had a credit rating of A-1+ or VMIG-1 and contained put options of seven days, which allows ADTRAN to sell the security before its stated maturity date to a remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer in the event we decide
to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate demand note. Approximately 75% of our variable rate demand notes are supported by letters of credit from banks that we believe are in good financial condition. Long-term investments represent a restricted certificate of deposit, municipal fixed-rate bonds, a fixed income bond fund, marketable equity securities, and other equity
investments. Marketable equity securities are reported at fair value as determined by the most recently traded price of the securities at the balance sheet date, although the securities may not be readily marketable due to the size of the available
market. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method and are included in current
income. We periodically review our investment portfolio for investments considered to have sustained an other-than-temporary decline in value. Impairment charges for other-than-temporary declines in value are recorded as realized losses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. All of our investments at December31, 2008 and 2007 are classified as available-for-sale see Note 3. Accounts Receivable We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. Prior to issuing payment terms to a new customer, we perform a
detailed credit review of the customer. Credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review. Payment terms are established for each new customer, and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order
to determine if the customers payment terms and credit limits need to be revised.

Index to Financial Statements
We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments. We regularly review the allowance for doubtful accounts and consider factors such as the age of accounts receivable balances, the current economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay, significant one-time events and
our historical experience. If the financial condition of a customer deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, we may be required to make additional allowances. If circumstances change with regard to individual
receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established, a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $38,000
at December31, 2008 and $109,000 at December31, 2007. Other Receivables Other receivables are comprised primarily of amounts due from subcontract manufacturers for product component transfers and accrued interest. Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in,
first-out method. Standard costs for material, labor and manufacturing overhead are used to value inventory. Standard costs are updated at least quarterly; therefore, inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period. We
establish reserves for estimated excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated fair value of the inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
When we dispose of excess and obsolete inventories, the related write-downs are charged against the inventory reserve. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment, which are stated at cost, are depreciated using methods which approximate straight-line depreciation over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. We depreciate building and land improvements from five to 39 years, office machinery and equipment from three to seven years, engineering machinery and equipment from three to seven years and computer software from three
to five years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Betterments that materially prolong the lives of the assets are capitalized. The cost of assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the gain or loss on such disposition is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Liability for Warranty Our products generally include warranties of
one to ten years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. Our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems
products. These products will require more warranty repairs to be completed at the installed location due to their size and complexity, rather than at a manufacturing site or repair depot. This field service obligation, as well as the increasing
complexity of our products, will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage, and other rework costs incurred in
correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record
additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $28 million and $29 million at
December31, 2008 and 2007 respectively. These liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Stock-Based Compensation We have two Board and stockholder approved stock option plans from which stock options and other awards are available for grant to employees and directors. All employee and director stock options granted under our stock option plans have an
exercise price equal to the fair market value, as defined in the plan, of the underlying common stock on the grant date. There are currently no vesting provisions tied to performance or market conditions for any option; vesting for all outstanding
option grants is based only on continued service as an employee or director of ADTRAN. All of our outstanding stock option awards are classified as equity awards. In 2008 and under the provisions of our approved plans, we made an initial grant of performance-based restricted stock units to five of our executive officers. The restricted stock units are earned based on the relative total shareholder
return of ADTRAN against a peer group of companies and vest at the end of a three-year performance period. The restricted stock units are converted into shares of common stock upon vesting. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the
performance period, the executive officers may earn from 0% to 150% of the number of restricted stock units granted. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected outcome
of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation technique. The recipients of the restricted stock units also earn dividend credits during the performance period, which will be paid in cash upon the issuance of common
stock for the restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation expense recognized under SFAS 123R in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $73 million 78 million and $81 million, respectively. As of December31, 2008, total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and restricted stock units not yet recognized was approximately $152 million, which is expected to be recognized
over an average remaining recognition period of 28 years. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment under the guidance prescribed by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate long-lived assets used in operations for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the asset are less than the assets carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized in the amount by which the recorded value of the
asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, measured by the quoted market price of an asset or an estimate based on the best information available in the circumstances. There were no such impairment losses recognized during 2008, 2007 and 2006.
Research and Development Costs Research and
development costs include compensation for engineers and support personnel, outside contracted services, depreciation and material costs associated with new product development, the enhancement of current products, and product cost reductions. We
continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts. Research and development costs totaled $818 million, $754 million and $707 million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources. Items included in comprehensive income include net income, changes in unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and
foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive income is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income. The components of accumulated comprehensive income loss are as follows:

Income Taxes The
provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the difference between financial and tax
bases of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be
realized. Foreign Currency We record transactions
denominated in foreign currencies on a monthly basis using exchange rates from throughout the year. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the balance sheet dates using the closing rates of exchange between those
foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar with any transaction gains or losses reported in income. Adjustments from translating financial statements of international subsidiaries are recorded as a component of accumulated comprehensive income loss.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is generally recognized
upon shipment of the product to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement, generally FOB shipping point. In the case of consigned inventory, revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of
the product. When contracts contain multiple elements, contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element contract should be treated as separate
units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize the revenue for each element. We record revenue associated with installation services when the installation
and all contractual obligations are complete. When contracts include both installation and product sales, the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item. Either the purchaser, ADTRAN, or a third party can perform the installation of
our products. Shipping fees are recorded as revenue and the related cost is included in cost of sales. Revenue is recorded net of discounts. Also, revenue is recorded when the product price is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting
receivable is probable, and product returns are reasonably estimable. Sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience, which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns. The majority of Enterprise Networks products are sold in the United States through a non-exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors. These large
organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value-added resellers and system integrators. Value-added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel partner, or they may purchase from the distributor in an
unaffiliated fashion. Additionally, with certain limitations our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock-balancing purposes when such returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value.
We participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers. We use these programs to reimburse customers for certain
forms of advertising, and in general, to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases. Our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in marketing expenses
in our consolidated statements of income. We also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products. Our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale, and are recorded as a
reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue primarily represents customer billings on our maintenance service programs and deferred revenues relating to multiple element contracts where we still have contractual obligations to our customers. We
currently offer maintenance contracts ranging from one to five years, primarily on Enterprise Networks Division products sold through distribution channels. Revenue attributable to maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the related contract term. In addition, we provide software maintenance and a variety of hardware maintenance services to Carrier Network Division customers under contracts with terms up to ten years. Non-current unearned revenue is included in
other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December31, 2008 and 2007, unearned revenue was as follows:  In thousands

Other Income, net Other income, net, is comprised primarily of miscellaneous income and expense, gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, investment account management fees, scrap raw material sales, and litigation costs. Earnings Per Share Earnings per common share, and earnings per
common share assuming dilution, are based on the weighted average number of common shares and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares outstanding during the year see Note 11. Dividends The Board of Directors presently anticipates that it will declare a regular quarterly dividend so long as
the current tax treatment of dividends exists and adequate levels of liquidity are maintained. During the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, ADTRAN paid $229 million, $246 million and $268 million, respectively, in dividend
payments. On January20, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $009 per common share to be paid to holders of record at the close of business on February5, 2009. The ex-dividend date was February3, 2009
and the payment date was February19, 2009. The quarterly dividend payment was $56 million. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period.
ADTRANs more significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, obsolete and excess inventory reserves, warranty reserves, customer rebates, allowance for sales returns, determination of the deferred revenue components of
multiple element sales agreements, estimated income tax contingencies, the fair value of stock-based compensation and the evaluation of other-than-temporary declines in the value of investments. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these
estimates. Recently Issued Accounting Standards During the first quarter of 2008, we adopted the following accounting standards, neither of which had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition:  Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an
Amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS 159, provides entities the option to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. SFAS 159 permits the
fair value option election on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument. We adopted SFAS 159 as of January1, 2008. We
elected not to apply the provisions of SFAS 159 to our eligible financial assets and financial liabilities on the date of adoption. Accordingly, the initial application of SFAS 159 had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.  FASB Statement No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, establishes a definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The definition of fair value focuses on the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or the amount paid to transfer a liability. Under SFAS 157, the fair value measurement should reflect all
of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. SFAS 157 establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in valuation techniques for fair value, consisting of: 1 observable inputs that
reflect quoted prices in active markets; 2 inputs other than quoted prices with observable market data; and 3 unobservable data. SFAS 157 requires disclosures detailing the extent to which we measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. We adopted SFAS 157 in its entirety, including fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, and the initial
application of SFAS 157 had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations, SFAS 141R which
establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS
141R establishes principles stipulating how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured. The statement also expands the disclosure requirements related to the nature and financial
impact of business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R to have a material impact on our consolidated results of
operations or financial condition. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statementsan Amendment of ARB No51 SFAS160, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.SFAS160 clarifies that
a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements.SFAS160 also requires consolidated net income to be reported at
amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest.It also requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated statement of income, of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the
parent and to the noncontrolling interest.SFAS160 also provides guidance when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary.SFAS160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008.We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Note 2Stock Incentive
Plans Stock Incentive Program Descriptions Our
Board of Directors adopted the 1996 Employee Incentive Stock Option Plan 1996 Plan effective February14, 1996, as amended, under which 170million shares of common stock were authorized for issuance to certain employees and officers
through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Options granted under the 1996 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four or five-year vesting schedule beginning
on the first anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. The 1996 Plan expired February14, 2006, and expiration dates of options outstanding at December31, 2008 under the 1996 Plan range from 2009 to 2016.
On January23, 2006, the Board of Directors adopted the 2006 Employee Stock Incentive Plan 2006 Plan, which authorizes 130million shares of
common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at
our annual meeting of stockholders held on May9, 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first
anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding at December31, 2008 under the 2006 Plan range from 2016 to 2018. Our stockholders approved the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan Directors Plan on May18, 2005, under which 04million shares of common stock have been reserved. The Directors Plan is a formula plan to
provide options to our non-employee directors. Options granted under the Directors Plan normally become exercisable in full on the first anniversary of the grant date, and have a ten-year contractual term. We currently also have options outstanding
under the 1995 Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended, which expired October31, 2005. Expiration dates of options outstanding under both plans at December31, 2008 range from 2010 to 2018.

At December31, 2008, 107million options were available for grant under the shareholder approved plans. The aggregate intrinsic values in the
table above represent the total pre-tax intrinsic value the difference between ADTRANs closing stock price on the last trading day of 2008 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options that would have been received
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December31, 2008. The amount of aggregate intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of ADTRANs stock. The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $37 million, $145 million and $51 million, respectively. The fair value of
options fully vesting during 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $74 million, $112 million and $47 million, respectively. Restricted Stock Program Description
On November6, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the Performance Shares Agreement under the 2006 Plan which sets
forth the terms and conditions of awards of performance-based restricted stock units RSUs. Of the 130million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2006 Plan, ADTRAN may grant up to 50million shares of common stock
for issuance to certain employees and officers for awards other than stock options, which would include RSUs. For the grants made in 2008, the number of shares of common stock earned by a recipient pursuant to the RSUs is based on ADTRANs
relative total shareholder return against a peer group at the end of a three-year performance period. Depending on the relative total shareholder return over the performance period, the recipient may earn from 0% to 150% of the shares underlying the
RSUs, with the shares earned distributed upon the vesting of the RSUs at the end of the three-year performance period. The fair value of the award is based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the expected
outcome of the impact of market conditions using a Monte Carlo Simulation valuation technique. A portion of the granted RSUs also vest and the underlying shares become deliverable upon the death or disability of the recipient or upon a change of
control of ADTRAN, as defined by the 2006 Plan. The recipients of the RSUs receive dividend credits based on the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs. The dividend credits are vested, earned and distributed in the same manner as the RSUs. On
November6, 2008, the Compensation Committee granted 26,100 RSUs with a fair value at the date of grant of $1705 per unit, to certain executive officers. As of December31, 2008, there was approximately $04 million of total unamortized
compensation cost related to the non-vested portion of this grant which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the three-year performance period.

Stock-Based Compensation On January1, 2006, ADTRAN adopted SFAS 123R, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and RSUs, based
on estimated fair values. SFAS 123R supersedes APB No25, which we previously applied, for periods beginning in fiscal 2006. ADTRAN adopted SFAS
123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the first day of our fiscal 2006 year. Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the 12 months ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our Consolidated Statements of Income for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of SFAS 123R.
New awards are valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption. Prior outstanding stock option awards that were not fully vested as of December31, 2005 are being recognized as compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income
over their remaining requisite service periods based on their previously established fair values. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, ADTRAN recorded the
intrinsic value of stock-based compensation as expense, in accordance with APB No25, as allowed under SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, no material amounts of stock-based compensation expense had been recorded in our Consolidated
Statements of Income prior to January1, 2006, other than as related to accelerated vesting at retirement, because the exercise price of the majority of our stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date
of grant. In our pro forma disclosures required under SFAS 123, we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred. SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate
the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest will be recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated
Statements of Income. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes compensation expense for stock-based payment awards granted prior to, but
not yet vested as of, December31, 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123, and compensation expense for the stock-based payment awards granted subsequent to December31,
2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. Compensation expense for all stock option awards is recognized using the ratable single-option approach. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in
our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest; therefore, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated
at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. As such, we evaluated the need to record a cumulative effect adjustment for estimated forfeitures upon the adoption of SFAS
123R. Because this adjustment only applies to the extent that compensation cost was previously recognized for the unvested awards, no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded upon adoption of SFAS 123R. ADTRAN uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model Black-Scholes Model for the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of stock option awards on the date of
grant under SFAS 123R. The Black-Scholes Model requires the input of certain assumptions that involve judgment. Because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, existing models may not provide reliable measures of fair value of our stock options. ADTRAN uses the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation technique to value its performance-based RSUs. We will
continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. If circumstances change, and additional data becomes available over time, we may change our assumptions and methodologies,
which may materially impact our fair value determination. ADTRAN elected to adopt the alternative transition method, as permitted by FASB Staff Position
No. FAS 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R for those awards that were outstanding upon adoption
of SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method allows the use of simplified methods to calculate the beginning capital-in-excess-of-par pool related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation and to determine the subsequent impact of the tax
effects of stock-based compensation awards on the capital-in-excess-of-par pool and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we reported all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating
cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS 123R requires cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the related compensation cost recognized in the financial statements excess tax benefits to be
classified as financing cash flows. In accordance with SFAS 123R, excess tax benefits recognized in periods after the adoption date have been classified as financing cash flows. Excess tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the adoption date
are classified as operating cash flows.

Valuation and Expense Information The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs under SFAS 123R for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, which was recognized as follows:  In thousands
2008 2007 2006 Stock-based compensation expense included in cost of sales 253 268 399 Selling, general and administrative expense 3,263 3,495 3,945 Research and development expense 3,822 4,052 3,794 Stock-based compensation expense included in operating expenses 7,085 7,547 7,739 Total stock-based compensation expense 7,338 7,815 8,138 Tax benefit for expense associated with non-qualified options 669 680 971 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax 6,669 7,135 7,167 At December31, 2008, total compensation cost related to non-vested stock options and RSUs not yet recognized
was approximately $152 million, which is expected to be recognized over an average remaining recognition period of 28 years. The stock option pricing
model requires the use of several significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. These variables include, but are not limited to, the volatility of our stock price and employee exercise behaviors. The assumptions and variables used for
the current period grants were developed based on SFAS 123R and SEC guidance contained in Staff Accounting Bulletin 107. There were no material changes made during 2008 to the methodology used to determine our assumptions. The weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors during the twelve months ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
$496 per share, $876 per share and $933 per share, respectively, with the following weighted-average assumptions:  2008 2007 2006 Expected volatility
4170 4342 4740 Risk-free interest rate
243 402 458 Expected dividend yield
233 156 158 Expected life in years
497 498 490
We based our estimate of expected volatility for the 12 months ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 on the
sequential historical daily trading data of our common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the options granted. The selection of the historical volatility method was based on available data indicating our historical volatility is as
equally representative of ADTRANs future stock price trends as is implied volatility. We have no reason to believe the future volatility of our stock price is likely to differ from its past volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon implied yields of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds on the date of grant having a remaining term equal to the expected
life of the options granted. The dividend yield is based on our historical and expected dividend payouts. The expected life of our stock options is based
upon historical exercise and cancellation activity of our previous stock-based grants with a ten-year contractual term. The RSU pricing model also
requires the use of several significant assumptions that impact the fair value estimate. The estimated fair value of the RSUs granted to employees on November6, 2008 was $1705, with the following assumptions:  2008 Expected volatility 3861 Risk-free interest rate 163 Expected dividend yield 235 Fair value of future dividend payments 106
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the 12 months ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is based on RSUs and options ultimately expected to vest, and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Estimates for forfeiture rates are based upon historical experience and are evaluated quarterly. We
expect our forfeiture rate for stock option awards to be approximately 50% annually. We estimated a 0% forfeiture rate for our RSUs due to the limited number of recipients and lack of historical experience for these awards.

plan assets, carried at fair value. At December31, 2008, we held $20 million in securities issued by a single government agency, with a maturity of
February 2009. At December31, 2008 and 2007, we held $1169 million and $1221 million of municipal fixed-rate bonds. At December31, 2008,
approximately 54% of our municipal fixed-rate bond portfolio had a credit rating of AAA and 46% had a credit rating of AA. These bonds are classified as available-for-sale investments and had an average duration of 10 years at December31,
2008. Because our bond portfolio has a high quality rating and contractual maturities of a short duration, we are able to obtain prices for these bonds derived from observable market inputs, or for similar securities traded in an active market, on a
daily basis. As of December31, 2008, municipal fixed-rate bonds had the following contractual maturities:  In thousands

At December31, 2008 and 2007, we held $526 million and $475 million of municipal variable rate demand notes, all
of which were classified as available-for-sale short-term investments. At December31, 2008, these municipal variable rate demand notes had a credit rating of A-1+ or VMIG-1 and contained put options of seven days. Thus, despite the long-term
nature of their stated contractual maturities, we believe we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities. Our investments in these securities are recorded at fair value, and the interest rates reset every seven days. We have the ability
to sell our variable rate demand notes to the remarketing agent, tender agent or issuer in the event we decide to liquidate our investment in a particular variable rate demand note. Approximately 75% of our variable rate demand notes are supported
by letters of credit from banks that we believe are in good financial condition. As a result, we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from these investments. All income generated from these
investments was recorded as interest income. We have not been required to record any losses relating to municipal variable rate demand notes or municipal auction rate securities, and we have held no municipal auction rate securities since
February7, 2008. At December31, 2008, we held $116 million of marketable equity securities, including a single security, of which we held
25million shares, carried at a fair value of $25 million. The single security traded approximately 59,000 shares per day in 2008, in an active market on a European stock exchange. This single security carried $16 million of the gross
unrealized gains included in the fair value of our marketable equity securities at December31, 2008. The remaining $01 million of unrealized gains and $21 million of gross unrealized losses at December31, 2008 were spread amongst more
than 350 equity securities. At December31, 2007, we held $217 million of marketable equity securities, including the single security mentioned above, of which we held 25million shares, carried at a fair value of $67 million. This
single security carried $58 million of the gross unrealized gains included in the fair value of our marketable equity securities at December31, 2007. The remaining $20 million of unrealized gains and $10 million of gross unrealized losses
at December31, 2007 were spread amongst more than 300 securities. At December31, 2008 and 2007, we held $09 million and $12 million of a
fixed income bond fund. This bond fund had unrealized losses of $04 million and $25,000 at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At
December31, 2008 and 2007, we held a $488 million and $490 million, respectively, restricted certificate of deposit, which is carried at cost. This investment serves as a collateral deposit against the principal amount outstanding under
loans made to ADTRAN pursuant to an Alabama State Industrial Development Authority revenue bond the Bond. ADTRAN has the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. For
more information on the Bond, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December31, 2008 and 2007, we held $22 million and $21
million, respectively, of other investments carried at cost, consisting of two private equity funds and a direct investment in a privately held telecommunications equipment manufacturer. The fair value of these investments was estimated to be
approximately $109 million at December31, 2008, based on unobservable inputs including information supplied by the investees. We have committed to invest up to an aggregate of $79 million in the two private equity funds, and we have
contributed $79 million as of December31, 2008, of which $74 million has been applied toward these commitments. As of December31, 2008, we have received distributions related to these two private equity funds of $63 million, of which
$06 million was recorded as a realized investment gain. These investments are carried at cost, net of distributions, with distributions in excess of our investment recorded as a realized investment gain. The duration of each of these commitments is
ten years with $02 million expiring in 2010 and $03 million expiring in 2012. We review our investment portfolio for potential
other-than-temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis. We assess, on a quarterly basis, significant declines in value which may be considered other-than-temporary and, if necessary, recognize and record the appropriate
charge to write-down the carrying value of such investments. In making this assessment, we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information, including but not limited to the following: the magnitude and duration of historical
declines in market prices, credit rating activity, assessments of liquidity, public filings, and statements made by the issuer. We generally begin our identification of potential other-than-temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair
value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by more than 25% for more than six months. We then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write-down, if any.
Because of the strained credit markets and deterioration in the equity markets experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008, we expanded the impairment review of our investments to assess the impact of these factors on our ability to recover our cost
in every security whose value had declined from its original or adjusted cost by more than 25%, regardless of the historical duration of the decline. We then evaluated individual securities to determine the amount of the write-down, if any. As a
result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $18 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 related to 96 marketable equity securities. As long as current market conditions 
56 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
continue to exist, we will continue to complete a similar review of individual securities for impairment each quarter. For each of the years ended
December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 we recorded a charge of $24 million, $01 million and $01 million, respectively, related to the other-than-temporary impairment of certain publicly traded equity securities. Although we believe our marketable
equity security portfolio is diversified, if the market conditions experienced at and subsequent to December31, 2008 prove to be other-than-temporary, we may be required to record additional impairments. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed under the specific identification method. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses
related to our investments.   Year Ended December31 2008 2007 2006 In thousands Gross realized gains 1,884 1,075 2,158 Gross realized losses 4,293 577 779

fourth quarter of 2008 due to the impact of strained credit markets and deteriorating equity market conditions on the value of these investments. At December31, 2008, a total of 216 of our marketable equity securities were in an unrealized
loss position. In accordance with SFAS 157, we have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value
into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows: Level 1 - Values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an
active market; Level 2 - Values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; Level 3 - Values based on prices or
valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. These inputs include information supplied by investees.

Note 6Alabama State Industrial Development Authority Financing and Economic Incentives In conjunction with an expansion of our Huntsville, Alabama, facility, we were approved for participation in an incentive program offered by the State of Alabama
Industrial Development Authority the Authority. Pursuant to the program, on January13, 1995, the Authority issued $200 million of its taxable revenue bonds and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to ADTRAN. The bonds
were originally purchased by AmSouth Bank of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama the Bank. Wachovia Bank, N.A., Nashville, Tennessee formerly First Union National Bank of Tennessee the Bondholder, which was acquired by Wells
Fargo Company on December31, 2008, purchased the original bonds from the Bank and made further advances to the Authority, bringing the total amount outstanding to $500 million. An Amended and Restated Taxable Revenue Bond
Amended and Restated Bond was issued and the original financing agreement was amended. The Amended and Restated Bond bears interest, payable monthly. The interest rate is 5%. The Amended and Restated Bond matures on January1,
2020. The estimated fair value of the bond at December31, 2008 was approximately $444 million, based on a debt security with a comparable interest rate and maturity and a Standard 
58 Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Poors credit rating of AA. We are required to make payments to the Authority in amounts necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Amended
and Restated Bond. Included in long-term investments at December31, 2008 is $488 million which is invested in a restricted certificate of deposit. These funds serve as a collateral deposit against the principal of this bond, and ADTRAN has
the right to set-off the balance of the Bond with the collateral deposit in order to reduce the balance of the indebtedness. In conjunction with this program, we are eligible to receive certain economic incentives from the state of Alabama that
reduce the amount of payroll withholdings that we are required to remit to the state for those employment positions that qualify under the program. We realized $14 million in economic incentives for each of the years ended December31, 2008,
2007 and 2006. Due to continued positive cash flow from operating activities, ADTRAN made a business decision to begin an early partial redemption of the
bond as evidenced by a $02 million principal payment in the third quarter of 2008 and a $05 million principal payment in the third quarters of 2006 and 2007. It is our intent to make annual principal payments of between $05 million and $50
million per year in addition to the interest amounts that are due. In connection with this decision, $05 million of the bond debt has been reclassified to a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 7Income Taxes A summary of the components of the

At December31, 2008 and 2007, non-current deferred tax liabilities related to investments reflect amounts provided
for changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these investments, a deferred tax benefit of $29 million in 2008 and a deferred tax provision of $14 million
in 2007, is recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income, presented in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity and Comprehensive Income. We have state research tax credit carry-forwards of $16 million which will expire between 2015 and 2023. These carry-forwards were caused by tax credits in excess of our annual tax liabilities to an individual state
where we no longer generate sufficient state income. In accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset arising from these
credits, and accordingly, have provided a valuation allowance. We do not provide for U.S. income tax on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations, whose earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested. For years ended December31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, foreign profits before income taxes were not material. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded an income tax deduction of $10
million, $44 million and $16 million, respectively, as an adjustment to equity in accordance with SFAS 123R. This deduction is calculated on the difference between the exercise price of stock option exercises and the market price of the underlying
common stock upon exercise. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 64%, 52% and 86%, respectively, of the income tax deduction related to disqualifying dispositions of shares acquired upon exercise of incentive
stock options and 36%, 48% and 14%, respectively, related to non-qualified stock options. On January1, 2007, ADTRAN adopted the provisions of FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 FIN 48, which requires a company to recognize the benefit of a tax position in its financial statements only if that position is
more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis solely on the technical merit of the position. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a decrease to stockholders equity of $12 million on January1, 2007 for unrecognized
tax expense, of which $05 million was related to estimated interest and penalties. The change in the unrecognized income tax benefits for 2008 and 2007 is reconciled below:  In thousands

million, respectively, of which $29 million and $27 million, respectively, would reduce our effective tax rate if we were successful in upholding all of the uncertain positions and recognized the amounts recorded. We classify interest and
penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The balances of accrued interest and penalties were $12 million and $11 million as of December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are included in the
table above. We do not anticipate a single tax position generating a significant increase or decrease in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits
within 12 months of this reporting date. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions and several foreign jurisdictions. We have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service through the 2004 tax year and by the
State of Alabama through the 2006 tax year. Generally, we are not subject to changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years prior to 2004.

Note 8Employee Benefit Plans 401k Savings Plan We maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. 401k Retirement Plan Savings Plan for the benefit of our
eligible employees. The Savings Plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401a and 401k of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended Code, and is intended to be a safe harbor 401k plan under Code Section401k12. The
Savings Plan allows employees to save for retirement by contributing part of their compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. The Savings Plan also requires us to contribute a safe harbor amount each year. In 2007 and 2006, we
contributed an amount equal to 3% of compensation for eligible employees who had completed a year of service by the end of the year. Beginning January1, 2008, we changed our contribution such that we matched up to 4% of employee contributions
100% of an employees first 3% of contributions and 50% of his or her next 2% of contributions. In calculating our matching contribution, we only use compensation up to the statutory maximum under the Code $230,000 for 2008. All
contributions under the Savings Plan are 100% vested. Expenses recorded for employer contributions and plan administration costs for the Savings Plan amounted to approximately $39 million, $31 million and $30 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan We
maintain the ADTRAN, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan is offered as a supplement to our tax-qualified 401k plan and is available to our management and highly compensated employees who have been designated by
our Board of Directors. The deferred compensation plan allows participants to defer all or a portion of certain specified bonuses and up to 25% of remaining cash compensation, and permits us to make matching contributions on a discretionary basis,
without the limitations that apply to the 401k plan. To date, we have not made any matching contributions under this plan. We have set aside the plan assets in a rabbi trust Trust and all contributions are credited to bookkeeping accounts for
the participants. The Trust assets are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. The assets of the Trust are deemed to be invested in pre-approved mutual funds as directed by each participant, and the
participants bookkeeping account is credited with the earnings and losses attributable to those investments. None of the Trust assets are invested in shares of ADTRAN common stock. Benefits are usually distributed six months after termination
of employment in a single lump sum cash payment. We account for the Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with EITF Abstract 97-14, Accounting for Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned are Held in a Rabbi Trust and
Invested. Assets of the Trust are deemed invested in mutual funds that cover an investment spectrum ranging from equities to money market instruments.
These mutual funds are publicly quoted and reported at fair value. We account for these investments in accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The fair value of the assets held by
the Trust and the amounts payable to the plan participants are as follows:  In thousands

as other income in the accompanying 2008 and 2007 Consolidated Statements of Income and in other comprehensive income in the accompanying 2008 and 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liability are
included as selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying 2008, 2007 and 2006 Consolidated Statements of Income. Based on the changes in the total fair value of the Trusts assets, we recorded deferred compensation adjustments
in 2008, 2007 and 2006 of $09 million, $03 million and $03 million, respectively.

significant expenditures. Although the outcome of any claim or litigation can never be certain, it is our opinion that the outcome of all contingencies of which we are currently aware will not materially affect our business, operations, financial
condition or cash flows.
