NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial
statements or the notes thereto relate to the continuing operations of Rockwell
International Corporation Rockwell or the Company and have been restated to
present its semiconductor systems business Semiconductor Systems as a
discontinued operation see Note 2. Prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with the current presentation.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries in which the Company has
control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated
in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are generally recorded as products are shipped or services are
rendered, except sales under certain contracts requiring performance over
several periods, which are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using LIFO, FIFO, or average
methods or market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.
Property
Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of property is provided based on
estimated useful lives generally using accelerated and straight-line methods.
Significant renewals and betterments are capitalized and replaced units are
written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amount, are
charged to expense.
Purchased Intangibles
Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business
acquisitions. The Company accounts for business acquisitions, under the purchase
method, by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities, including research and development projects which have not yet
reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use purchased
research and development. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded
at their fair values; the appraised value of purchased research and development
is immediately charged to expense, and the excess of the purchase price over the
amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over periods generally
ranging from 10 to 40 years. Trademarks, patents, product technology, and other
intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, ranging from 5 to 40 years.
24
25
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable,
and for all assets to be disposed of. Long-lived assets held for use are
reviewed for impairment by assessing their net realizable values based on
estimated undiscounted cash flows over their remaining useful lives. If
impairment is indicated, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its fair
value.
Environmental Matters
The Company records accruals for environmental matters in the accounting
period in which its responsibility is established and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. Revisions to the accruals are made in the periods in which the
estimated costs of remediation change. At environmental sites in which more than
one potentially responsible party has been identified, the Company records a
liability for its estimated allocable share of costs related to its involvement
with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the
involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in
which the Company is the only responsible party, the Company records a liability
for the total estimated costs of remediation. Costs of future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
If recovery from insurers or other third parties is determined to be probable,
the Company records a receivable for the estimated recovery.
In 1998, the Company adopted the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants AICPA Statement of Position SOP No. 96-1, Environmental
Remediation Liabilities. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
effect on the financial statements.
New Accounting Standards
In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. For 1998, the results of the Company
continuing operations were a loss, making its stock options antidilutive.
Therefore, 1998 diluted per share amounts exclude 29 million shares of
potentially dilutive stock options and equal basic per share amounts. For 1997
and 1996, dilutive stock options resulted in an increase in outstanding shares
of 33 million and 35 million, respectively.
In 1998, the Company adopted AICPA SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs
of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1
requires the cost of purchased software and certain costs incurred in developing
computer software for internal use to be capitalized and amortized over future
periods. During the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company continuing
businesses capitalized $46 million of such costs that would have been charged to
expense under its previous accounting policy.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, which
is effective for 2000. SFAS 133 will require the Company to record all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that are hedges,
changes in the fair value of derivatives will be offset by the changes in the
fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. The Company
believes the impact of adopting this standard will not be material to results of
operations or equity.
Accounting Change
Effective October 1, 1997, Rockwell changed its method of accounting for
certain general and administrative costs related to government contracts to
expense these costs as incurred. Under the previous accounting method, these
costs were included in inventory. The amount of general and administrative costs
included in inventory as of October 1, 1997, was $27 million $17 million after
tax, or nine cents per share and is presented as the cumulative effect of an
accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
September 30, 1998. The effect of the accounting change on income from
continuing operations in 1997 would not have been material.
25
26
2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On November 4, 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the
spin-off of Semiconductor Systems into an independent, separately traded public
company, which is named Conexant Systems, Inc. Conexant. The spin-off, which
is expected to occur on December 31, 1998, will be at the rate of one share of
Conexant common stock for every two shares of Company Common Stock owned as of
the close of business on December 11, 1998. The Company has received a ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service that the spin-off will be tax-free to Company
shareowners.
On September 30, 1997, the Company completed the spin-off of its automotive
component systems businesses Automotive into an independent company by
distributing all of the issued and outstanding shares of Meritor Automotive,
Inc. Meritor to the Company shareowners on a pro-rata basis. In connection
with the transaction, Meritor made a special payment of $445 million to the
Company and the net assets of Meritor as of September 30, 1997 of $151 million
were recorded as a decrease to equity.
In December 1996, the Company divested its former Aerospace and Defense
businesses the A Business by merging it with a subsidiary of The Boeing
Company Boeing in a tax-free reorganization the Reorganization. In
connection with the Reorganization, all shares of Common Stock held in treasury
were canceled and the net liabilities of the A Business at the date of the
Reorganization of approximately $12 billion were recorded as an increase to
additional paid-in capital.
In October 1996, the Company Graphic Systems business Graphic Systems
was sold for approximately $600 million.
The net assets of Semiconductor Systems consisted of the following in
millions:

Net assets of Semiconductor  $ 986  $1,115
Prior to the spin-off, Semiconductor Systems will distribute its wafer
fabrication facilities in Colorado Springs, Colorado and the related tax
benefit to the Company. At September 30, 1998, these facilities had a net book
value of $42 million and a related deferred tax benefit of $36 million. These
facilities will be classified by the Company as assets held for disposal upon
distribution.

$ 301  $ 207  $ 362
The 1998 net loss of Semiconductor Systems includes a $66 million charge
$40 million after tax for inventory write-offs, a $43 million charge $26
million after tax for intellectual property matters and special charges of $147
million $90 million after tax, all recorded in the fourth quarter. The special
charges include an asset impairment of $103 million related to the closure and
planned disposal of wafer fabrication facilities in Colorado Springs, Colorado 15 million for employee severance and voluntary early retirement program costs
associated with an approximate 10 percent worldwide workforce reduction, $11
million related to intangible asset write-offs and $18 million for other actions
including lease termination costs, contractual liabilities and other asset
write-offs. These actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end
of fiscal 1999. The 1998 net loss and net assets of Semiconductor Systems also
include accruals of $57 million $35 million after tax for an estimate of
Semiconductor Systems operating losses expected to be incurred from October 1,
1998 to December 31, 1998, the expected date of the spin-off, and $18 million
$16 million after tax for related transaction costs.
Semiconductor Systems' net income for 1997 includes a third quarter $30
million charge $19 million after tax for the write-off of purchased research
and development in connection with the acquisition of the Hi-Media broadband
communication chipset business of ComStream Corporation. Semiconductor Systems'
1996 net income includes a charge of $121 million before and after tax for the
write-off of purchased research and development in connection with the
acquisition of Brooktree Corporation.
The 1997 and 1996 income of Automotive includes fourth quarter
restructuring charges of $21 million $15 million after tax and $46 million
$30 million after tax, respectively. The net income of Automotive for fiscal
1997 also includes a fourth quarter charge of $57 million $48 million after
tax for transaction and separation-related costs incurred in connection with
the spin-off of Meritor.
The earnings of the A Business for the first two months of 1997 were
entirely offset by expenses related to the Reorganization.
The discontinued businesses utilized certain management services provided
by the Company, including financial, legal, tax, corporate communications and
human resources. For the A Business, the costs of these services are allowable
overhead costs on government contracts and, accordingly, have been included in
27
28
the results of operations of this business. These costs have been allocated to
the A Business using a variety of factors, including sales, assets, inventory
and payroll and were $3 million and $35 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Management believes that the method of allocating these costs to the A
Business is reasonable.
Interest expense of $40 million and $169 million in 1997 and 1996,
respectively, has been allocated to the Automotive and A businesses based on
the actual interest expense associated with the borrowings assumed by Meritor
and Boeing.
3. SPECIAL CHARGES
In the third quarter of 1998, the Company recorded special charges of $597
million $508 million after tax, or $257 per share. These charges, including
the effects of fourth quarter adjustments, were as follows: goodwill and other
asset impairments, $415 million; severance and other employee separation costs
associated with a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 3,000
employees, $110 million; and costs related to facility closures and
consolidations and exiting non-strategic businesses and product lines, $72
million. These actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of
1999.
Total cash expenditures are expected to approximate $176 million. The
Company spent approximately $20 million through September 30, 1998, of which $16
million related to severance and other employee separation costs, and expects to
spend approximately $92 million in 1999 related to these actions. As a result of
actions taken during the fourth quarter, the workforce was reduced by
approximately 800 employees.
As of September 30, 1998, approximately $156 million is included in the
consolidated balance sheet for remaining activities associated with the third
quarter special charges. Of this amount, approximately $83 million and $11
million are included in compensation and benefits and in other liabilities,
respectively, for severance and other employee separation costs; and
approximately $28 million, $8 million, and $26 million are included in accounts
payable, other current liabilities, and other liabilities, respectively, for
costs of facility closures and consolidations and exiting non-strategic
businesses and product lines.
The special charges also include an impairment of the long-lived assets of
Automation industrial motors business Motors. The impairment charge of $266
million resulted from the significant long-term decline in operating performance
and represents the excess of the carrying value of the long-lived assets
including goodwill of Motors over their estimated fair value as determined by
management, with the assistance of outside experts, utilizing accepted valuation
techniques. The Company also recorded impairment charges of $53 million related
to the long-lived assets of businesses which were sold during 1998 or are held
for disposition.
During 1996, the Company recorded special charges of $76 million $47
million after tax, or 22 cents per share. The special charges related to a
decision to discontinue or dispose of certain product lines of continuing
operations, as well as the costs associated with staff reductions in the
Automation and Avionics & Communications businesses. The provision included
asset impairments of $51 million, severance and other employee separation costs
of $9 million, and contractual commitments and other costs of $16 million. These
actions were substantially completed by the end of 1997.
The special charges are reflected in the consolidated statement of
operations as follows in millions:
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
1998   1997   1996
Cost of   $455        $59
Selling, general, and   142    --    17

Revenues of businesses and product lines which are being exited were $197
million, $211 million and $199 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
The net operating loss related to these businesses and product lines is not
material.

29
4. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES
In the first quarter of 1998, the Company acquired the in-flight
entertainment business of Hughes-Avicom International, Inc. Passenger Systems.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded a charge of $103
million $63 million after tax for purchased research and development and
recorded $70 million for other intangible assets, including developed
technology, patents, assembled workforce and goodwill, which are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over 10 years. The remaining assets acquired and
liabilities assumed have been recorded at estimated fair values determined by
the Company management based on information currently available. The Company
acquired several businesses in fiscal 1997 at a net cost of $51 million.
These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the
results of operations of these businesses have been included in the consolidated
statement of operations since their dates of acquisition.

approximately $750 million of proceeds.
10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments include cash, equity securities, short-
and long-term debt and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. At September
30, 1998, the carrying values of the Company financial instruments
approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates.
It is the policy of the Company not to enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does enter into foreign
currency forward exchange contracts in the ordinary course of business to
protect itself from adverse currency rate fluctuations on both firm and
anticipated foreign currency
30
31
transactions. These contracts are generally for terms of less than one year.
Gains or losses relating to hedging firm commitments are deferred and included
in the measurement of the foreign currency transaction subject to the hedge and
gains or losses relating to anticipated transactions are recognized currently.
The Company foreign currency forward exchange contracts are executed with
creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial
countries. The notional amount of all of the Company outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts aggregated $578 million and $239 million at
September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively, including contracts relating to
discontinued operations. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position relating to these
foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
11. CAPITAL STOCK
At September 30, 1998, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of one
billion shares of Common Stock, with a $1 par value, and 25 million shares of
preferred stock, without par value. At September 30, 1998, 22 million shares of
Common Stock were reserved for various employee incentive plans. In fiscal 1997,
all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock were converted into Common Stock.
Changes in outstanding common shares are summarized as follows in
millions:
1998   1997   1996
Beginning  2068  2185  2170
Treasury stock  185  134  09
Other, principally stock option exercises.  23   17   24
Ending  1906  2068  2185
Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Each outstanding share of Common Stock provides the holder with one
Preferred Share Purchase Right Right. The Rights will become exercisable only
if a person or group acquires, or offers to acquire, 20% or more of the Common
Stock, although the Company is authorized to reduce the 20% threshold for
triggering the Rights to not less than 10%. Upon exercise, each Right entitles
the holder to 1/100th of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock of the Company Junior Preferred Stock at a price of $250, subject to
adjustment.
Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right other than Rights held by
the acquiror will generally be exercisable for $500 worth of Common Stock or
common stock of the acquiror for $250. In certain circumstances, each Right may
be exchanged by the Company for one share of Common Stock or 1/100th of a share
of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights will expire on December 6, 2006, unless
earlier exchanged or redeemed at $001 per Right.
12. STOCK OPTIONS
Options to purchase Common Stock of the Company have been granted under
various incentive plans to directors, officers and other key employees at prices
equal to or above the fair market value of such stock on the dates the options
were granted. The plans provide that the option price for certain options
granted under the plans may be paid in cash, the Company Common Stock or a
combination thereof.
Under the 1995 Long-Term Incentives Plan, the Company may grant up to 16
million shares of Company Common Stock as non-qualified options, incentive stock
options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were 9 million at
September 30, 1998. Stock options generally expire ten years from the date they
are granted and vest over three years. None of the incentive plans presently
permits options to be granted after September 30, 2005.

In connection with the divestiture of the A Business and the spin-off of
Automotive, the number of options outstanding and the exercise prices of such
options were adjusted in order to preserve the value of the options that were
outstanding as of the date of each divestiture. Additionally, in connection with
the Automotive spin-off, Rockwell options granted to Automotive employees during
1997 were converted into Meritor options. In connection with the Semiconductor
Systems spin-off, outstanding Rockwell options will be adjusted to preserve the
value of such options on the date of the spin-off, including the conversion of
certain options to options for shares of Conexant.

In 1997, the Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recorded relative to the Company stock-based
compensation plans. If the Company accounted for its stock-based plans using the
fair value method provided by SFAS 123, the Company net income and earnings
per share would have been reduced, and net loss and loss per share increased, to
the following pro forma amounts in millions, except per share amounts:

13. RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS
The Company has retirement medical plans which cover most of its United
States employees and provide for the payment of medical costs of eligible
employees and dependents upon retirement.
Retirement medical expense for continuing operations consisted of the
following in millions:
1998  1997  1996
Service cost--benefits attributed to service during the
$ 9   $ 8   $ 8
Interest on accumulated retirement medical obligation.  49   48    46

The Company retirement medical obligation at September 30, 1998 and 1997
consisted of the following in millions:
1998  1997
Accumulated retirement medical obligation:
$292  $482
Employees eligible to   50   58
Employees not eligible to   136   123

Assumptions used June 30 measurement date:
Discount  675%  75%
Health care cost trend   70%*  80 
-  
* Decreasing to 55% after 2015.
In 1998, the Company announced to its current and former United States
employees that it will be consolidating its employee and retiree medical plans
into one comprehensive medical benefits program. The changes announced include
offering one common plan design to all Rockwell active employees and retirees,
consolidating the number of medical benefit providers utilized by the Company
and increasing the amount of employee and retiree cost sharing. Unamortized
amounts related to this and other plan amendments at September 30, 1998 reflect
the accumulated cost reduction on the retirement benefit obligation and will
reduce future retirement medical expense.
33
34
Increasing the health care cost trend rates by one percentage point would
increase the accumulated retirement medical obligation at September 30, 1998 by
approximately $35 million and would have increased 1998 retirement medical
expense by approximately $6 million.
14. RETIREMENT PENSION PLANS
The Company has pension plans which cover most of its employees and provide
for monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service
and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees generally are based
on specified benefit amounts and years of service. The Company policy is to
fund its pension obligations in conformity with the funding requirements of
applicable laws and governmental regulations.
Net pension expense for continuing operations consisted of the following
in millions:
1998   1997   1996
Service cost--benefits earned during the year. $ 65  $ 61  $ 60
Interest on projected benefit   145   136   208
Assumed return on plan   172  155  223
Initial net asset   10   11   21
Prior service cost    10    9    8
Net actuarial loss    2    5    24
Net pension  $ 40  $ 45  $ 56
Pension plan assets are primarily equity securities, United States
Government obligations, and other fixed income investments whose values are
subject to fluctuations of the securities market. The actual return on plan
assets allocated to continuing operations was $398 million, $368 million, and
$503 million in 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. Differences between these
actual returns and the related assumed returns on plan assets are deferred and
considered in the determination of net pension expense in future periods.
The reduction in the amount of interest on the projected benefit obligation
and the return on plan assets from 1996 to 1997 is a result of the assumption by
Boeing of the pension plan assets and liabilities relating to substantially all
of the former United States employees of Rockwell continuing businesses as of
December 31, 1995 in connection with the Reorganization.

Long-term deferred income  $ 102  $ 72
Management believes it is more likely than not that current and long-term
tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income.
Significant factors considered by management in its determination of the
probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include: a the
historical operating results of the Company $29 billion of United States
taxable income over the past three years, b expectations of future earnings,
and c the extended period of time over which the retirement medical liability
will be paid. The valuation allowance represents the amount of tax benefits
related to net operating loss, capital loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards
that have not yet been recognized. The carryforward period for net operating and
capital losses expires between 1999 and 2006. The carryforward period for
foreign tax credits expires between 1999 and 2002.

The income tax provisions were calculated based upon the following
components of loss income from continuing operations before income taxes in
millions:
1998  1997  1996
United States loss  $27  $669  $430
Foreign   52   66   102
$ 25  $735  $532
No provision has been made for United States, state, or additional foreign
income taxes related to approximately $161 million of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently
reinvested.
The Company United States income tax returns for the years 1989 through
1994 are currently under examination. In connection with the divestiture of the
A Business, the Automotive spin-off and the expected Semiconductor Systems
spin-off, the Company has retained, and expects to retain, all tax liabilities
and the right to all tax refunds related to United States and certain non-U.S.
operations of the A Business, Automotive and Semiconductor Systems for periods
prior to the respective divestiture dates. Management believes that adequate
provision for income taxes has been made for all years through 1998.

1996, respectively, and are included in the determination of the cash flows of
discontinued operations.
Minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated $232 million as of
September 30, 1998 and are payable as follows in millions: 1999, $51; 2000 43; 2001, $33; 2002, $25; 2003, $19; and after 2003, $61.
17. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of
substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other
activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an impact on
the manufacturing operations of the Company. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been
accomplished without material effect on the Company liquidity and capital
resources, competitive position or financial statements.
The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party at 23
Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which the Company records disclose no
involvement or as to which the Company potential liability has been finally
determined. Management estimates the total reasonably possible costs the Company
could incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at September 30, 1998 to be
about $16 million, substantially all of which has been accrued.
Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against
the Company alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental
protection requirements, or seeking remediation of alleged
37
38
environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As of
September 30, 1998, management has estimated the total reasonably possible costs
the Company could incur for these matters to be about $132 million. The Company
has recorded environmental accruals for these matters of $97 million.
Of the $97 million accrual for environmental matters, $35 million relates
to liabilities assumed in connection with the fiscal 1995 acquisition of
Reliance Electric Company. In 1998, the Company reached an agreement with Exxon
Corporation Exxon whereby Exxon will continue to indemnify the Company for
substantially all costs related to certain environmental matters, and also
reimburse the Company for substantially all costs related to an environmental
matter for which Exxon had previously disputed its obligation. Accordingly, in
1998, the Company recorded a $16 million receivable from Exxon related to the
previously disputed matter and has total receivables from Exxon related to these
matters of $32 million at September 30, 1998.
Based on its assessment, management believes that the Company
expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to
comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other
expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company liquidity and capital resources, competitive
position or financial statements. Management cannot assess the possible effect
of compliance with future requirements.
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or
asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its business, including
those pertaining to product liability, intellectual property, safety and health
and employment matters. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Rockwell has agreed to
indemnify Boeing for certain government contract and environmental matters
related to operations of the A Business for periods prior to the
Reorganization. In connection with the Automotive spin-off, Meritor has agreed
to indemnify the Company for substantially all contingent liabilities related to
Automotive. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with
certainty and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of
unfavorably to the Company, management believes the disposition of matters which
are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial statements.
In connection with the Semiconductor Systems spin-off, Conexant will assume
all contingent liabilities related to its business, including environmental and
intellectual property matters. In September 1995, Celeritas Technologies, Ltd.
filed suit against the Company for patent infringement, misappropriation of
trade secrets and breach of contract relating to cellular telephone data
transmission technology utilized in certain modem products produced by
Semiconductor Systems. In July 1997, the court entered a judgment awarding
damages of $57 million, plus interest. On July 20, 1998, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the trial court judgment based on
breach of contract. The Company continues to believe the judgment is in error
and has filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. At
September 30, 1998, the Company had accrued a liability of approximately $65
