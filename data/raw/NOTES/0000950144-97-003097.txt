their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 29, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial

statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Planet
Hollywood International, Inc. PHII and its wholly and majority owned
subsidiaries collectively, the Company. All material intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has
interests in various entities which are not majority owned or controlled. The
Company uses the equity method to account for these interests.
The Company fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest
to December 31. The fiscal years ended January 1, 1995, December 31, 1995 and
December 29, 1996 are herein referred to as fiscal 1994, fiscal 1995 and
fiscal 1996, respectively.
Description of Business
The Company primary business is to create and develop consumer brand
names. To date, the Company has promoted its brands primarily through the
operation of distinctive entertainment-oriented theme restaurants and their
associated merchandise sales. The Company currently operates under the Planet
Hollywood and Official All Star Cafe brands. Direct revenues in the accompanying
financial statements include sales of food, beverage and merchandise.
Merger
Prior to June 1993, the business and operations of the Company were
conducted by Planet Hollywood, Inc. PHI, a Delaware corporation. In June
1993, PHI contributed the assets and liabilities of the business to Planet
Hollywood, Ltd. PHL, a limited partnership, for the sole general partnership
interest. Planet Hollywood Investments, Ltd. PHIL, an unrelated entity,
acquired the sole limited partnership interest.
On January 1, 1995, the Company reorganized and PHII became the primary
operating and reporting entity for the Company. In connection with the
reorganization and merger the Reorganization, PHI was merged into PHII in
exchange for PHII Class A common stock, PHIL contributed its limited partnership
interest in PHL and an affiliate of PHIL contributed a 50% interest in Planet
Hollywood Asia Ptd. Ltd. PH Asia in exchange for PHII Class A common
stock, and certain celebrities and others contributed their participation
interests in the predecessors to PHII in exchange for PHII Class A common stock.
Prior to the date of the Reorganization, the consolidated financial statements
included the accounts of PHI and PHL and their affiliated entities under common
control. The Reorganization was treated as an exchange between entities under
common control and was accounted for at historical cost as, in the opinion of
the Company, the substance of the Reorganization was solely a change in the
corporate form of the reporting entity.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less and consist of amounts held as bank
deposits and certificates of deposit. At December 31, 1995, the Company had
approximately $610 of cash equivalents restricted as to use.
The fair value of financial instruments, consisting of investments in cash,
cash equivalents, receivables, obligations under accounts payable and accrued
expenses is based on interest rates available to the Company and comparison to
quoted prices. At December 31, 1995 and December 29, 1996, the fair value of
these financial instruments approximates carrying value.

25
PLANET HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Inventories
Inventories, consisting primarily of merchandise, are valued at the lower
of cost determined by the first-in, first-out method or market.
Preopening Costs
The Company capitalizes costs relating to opening of units and amortizes
such costs over the twelve months following the opening date of the unit.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided for by using the straight-line method over the
following useful lives:
YEARS
Furniture and  5-10
20
Leasehold  5-40
Expenditures for additions and improvements which extend the life of the
assets are capitalized. Expenditures for normal repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Transportation equipment is depreciated over 10
years less a 20% residual value. Depreciation of memorabilia commences when it
is placed in service upon its installation at a unit location.
Goodwill
The excess of purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is
amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years. Accumulated amortization of
goodwill at December 31, 1995 and December 29, 1996 was $59 and $1,028,
respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of 
SFAS 121, was implemented by the Company in fiscal 1996. SFAS 121 states
that if the carrying value of an asset, including associated intangibles,
exceeds the sum of estimated undiscounted cash flows from the operation of the
asset, an impairment loss should be recognized for the difference between the
asset estimated fair value and carrying value. As the Company previous
accounting policy was consistent with the provisions of SFAS 121, there was no
impact as a result of the new standard.
Debt Issuance Costs
Costs related to the issuance of debt are capitalized and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the
related debt.
Minority Interests
Minority interests represent third party capital contributions received by
the Company and the minorities' equity in the earnings or losses in the entities
which are majority owned by the Company.
Food, Beverage and Merchandise Revenues
Food, beverage and merchandise revenues are recognized as the products are
sold to customers.

PLANET HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Franchise and Royalty Revenues
Revenues from the sale of franchises are deferred until the Company
fulfills its obligations under the franchise agreement, which is generally upon
the opening of a franchise restaurant or merchandise shop. The franchise
agreements provide for continuing royalty fees based on a percentage of gross
receipts.
Advertising and Promotional Costs
All costs associated with advertising and promoting the Company brands
are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising expense for fiscal 1994, 1995
and 1996 totaled $491, $2,103 and $2,753, respectively.
Income Taxes
All of the entities included in the consolidated financial statements of
the Company were treated as pass-through entities for federal income tax
purposes prior to fiscal 1995. The entities were not subject to federal income
tax at the Company level. Accordingly, federal income taxes have not been
provided for in the accompanying financial statements for fiscal 1994. Foreign,
state and local income taxes were provided for only with respect to such amounts
that were attributable to state or local jurisdictions which subjected the
pass-through entities to entity-level income taxes. Had the entities been
subject to taxation in fiscal 1994, no provision for income taxes would have
been recorded due to losses incurred.
As a result of the Reorganization, the Company became a taxable corporation
effective January 1, 1995. Deferred taxes are provided for the tax effects of
the differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for tax and
financial reporting purposes. These differences relate primarily to differences
in depreciable lives and amortization periods for property and equipment and
preopening costs, deferred rentals, the timing of franchise revenue recognition
and certain accrued expenses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the
future tax consequence of those differences.
No provision is made for United States income taxes applicable to
undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates that are indefinitely reinvested in
the foreign operations.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into United
States dollars at the year-end rate of exchange. Revenue and expense accounts
are translated at the average rate of exchange. Resulting translation
adjustments are included in the caption cumulative currency translation
adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Gains and losses
from foreign currency transactions which are included in the consolidated
statements of operations were not material.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for compensation costs related to employee stock
options and other forms of employee stock-based compensation plans in accordance
with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 APB 25. APB
25 requires compensation costs for stock-based compensation plans to be
recognized based on the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant and the option exercise price. In October 1995, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS
123 established a fair value-based method of accounting for compensation costs
related to stock options and other forms of stock-based compensation plans.
However, SFAS 123 allows an entity to continue to measure compensation costs
using the principles of APB 25 if certain pro forma disclosures are made. SFAS
123 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The Company
adopted the provisions for pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 in
fiscal 1996. Options granted to non-employees are recorded at their estimated
fair value at the date of grant.

PLANET HOLLYWOOD INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share EPS is computed based on the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents
outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents consist of common stock
which may be issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants using
the treasury stock method.
The weighted average number of shares outstanding has been adjusted to
reflect as outstanding for the entire period all common stock and common stock
equivalents issued during the fifty-two week period preceding the initial public
offering date of the Company common stock using the treasury stock method at
the price of common stock pursuant to the offering.
Supplemental pro forma earnings per share, which gives effect to the
repayment of certain indebtedness by application of a portion of the net
proceeds from the initial public offering as if the prepayment had occurred at
the beginning of the fiscal year, would have been $048 and $038 on earnings
before extraordinary item and on net income, respectively. The supplemental pro
forma weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of EPS was
105,936,000.
Earnings per share has not been presented for fiscal 1994 as the
predecessor in that period was a limited partnership.
Leases
The Company has various noncancelable operating and capital lease
agreements, primarily unit sites. Unit leases are established using a base
amount and/or a percentage of sales. Certain of these leases provide for
escalating lease payments over the terms of the leases. For financial statement
purposes, the total amount of base rentals over the terms of the leases is
charged to expense on the straight-line method over the lease terms. Rental
expense in excess of lease payments is recorded as a deferred rental liability.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the prior years' consolidated

In February 1996, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the
remaining minority interests in All Star. Under the terms of the agreement, the
Company issued 11,545,706 shares of Class B non-voting stock in exchange for all
of the minority interests in All Star. Due to the high degree of common control
between the Company and All Star and the lack of an exchange of monetary
consideration, the acquisition was accounted for as a reorganization of entities
under common control. Accordingly, the bases of All Star assets and
liabilities are carried at historical cost.
The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming
that the acquisition of All Star took place at the beginning of fiscal 1995. The
unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of

warrants were subject to increase or decrease by up to 50% based upon the total
rate of return to the holders upon repayment of the Notes, including the fair
value of the warrants at the date they become exercisable or are deemed
exercised. The warrants became exercisable upon the repayment of the Notes. The
number of warrants which may be exercised were reduced by 50% to 2,556,383 based

Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for the 1995 Stock
Plan. Had compensation cost for the 1995 Stock Plan been determined based on the
fair value at the date of grant for awards in 1995 and 1996 consistent with the
provisions of FAS 123, the Company net income and earnings per share would
approximate the following pro forma amounts:

Earnings per share -- pro    24    35
The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: no dividend yield; expected volatility of 33%; risk free interest
rates of 595%; and expected lives of 4 years. The weighted-average fair value
of options granted during the year was $163 for fiscal 1995 and $683 for
fiscal 1996.

9. FRANCHISE REVENUES
In December 1992, the Company entered into an agreement with PH Asia, an
entity controlled by the majority stockholder of PHIL stockholder, whereby PH
Asia was granted the right to license the Planet Hollywood name and rights
within a number of countries, primarily in the Pacific Rim. The agreement
provided that PH Asia would pay continuing royalty fees and, for certain
territories, PH Asia and the Company would share initial franchise fees. In
connection with the Reorganization, the Company received a 50% interest in PH
Asia, the obligation to pay royalty fees was canceled and PH Asia received the
right to retain 100% of the initial franchise fees for certain territories. In
1996, PH Asia opened four franchise units, and the Company received the initial
franchise fee revenue for three of the units opened.
In 1993, the Company terminated the franchise agreement for the Planet
Hollywood Cancun location and two additional undeveloped Mexican sites for
non-payment of fees. The Company commenced legal proceedings to prohibit the use
of the Company trademarks. The Company received an injunction against the
defendants who filed an appeal and posted a $1,000 surety bond. During 1994, the
Company was awarded $2,600 in damages by an arbitration panel. In December 1994,
the Company acquired the assets of the Cancun location for $5,600 with a note
payable of $4,600 and the proceeds from the $1,000 surety bond. The Company
recognized $1,000 from the arbitration award as royalty revenues in 1994. The
Cancun location was sold to ECE in June 1995 see Note 2.
During 1995, the Company entered into a franchise agreement with ECE, an
affiliated company see Note 4, which allows ECE to develop and operate up to
five Planet Hollywood units and up to ten Official All Star Cafe units in
Mexico. Upon Company approval, ECE may open an additional five Planet Hollywood
units. In 1996, ECE opened 5 franchise units. ECE pays continuing royalty fees
as defined in the agreement.
In December 1995, the Company terminated a site franchise agreement of an
existing franchisee and purchased the franchise rights to four undeveloped
locations. The Company assumed certain liabilities and lease obligations
relating to the four undeveloped locations. In consideration for the franchise
rights, the Company will pay the seller an amount equal to a multiple of each
unit first year profits less the costs to develop and open the site, as
defined. The franchisee forfeited the nonrefundable initial franchise fees of
$2,000 each for the four sites. These unearned franchise fees are included in
deferred credits and any consideration paid for the four sites will be offset
against each site related unearned franchise fee.

taxable income in the future to utilize the deductible temporary differences and
carryforwards.

the fiscal year 2011. The use of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards is
subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company does
not anticipate that these limitations will affect utilization of the
carryforwards prior to their expiration.
Provision has not been made for United States or foreign taxes on the
undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates, as those earnings are considered
to be permanently invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the
tax on such earnings. Such earnings would become taxable upon the sale or
liquidation of the investment in these foreign affiliates or upon the remittance
of dividends. Upon remittance, certain foreign countries impose withholding
taxes that are then available, subject to certain limitations, for use as
credits against the Company United States tax liability.
