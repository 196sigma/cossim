ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPLEMENTARY DATA.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Elamex, S.A. de C.V.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Elamex,
S.A. de C.V. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for
goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
2004, 2003 AND 2002
IN THOUSANDS OF U.S. DOLLARS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
COMPANY BACKGROUND - Elamex, S.A. de C.V. and its subsidiaries Elamex or the
Company are a group of Companies in Mexico and the United States that provide
manufacturing, packaging and distribution services. The Company provides
customized manufacturing services in the candy and nut industry. The Company
manufacturing machinery and equipment are located in facilities in Ciudad
Juarez, in Mexico, and in El Paso, Texas in the United States.
On December 19, 2003 the Metal Stamping segment, a wholly owned subsidiary,
Precision Tool, Die and Machine Company Precision, voluntarily filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to implement a restructuring of its debt. Also, in December
2003 the Company Board of Directors authorized the sale of Precision. As a
consequence of seeking protection under bankruptcy laws, the Company no longer
controls Precision operations as of December 19, 2003. The Company
investment in Precision was deconsolidated and was recognized in accordance with
the equity method of accounting in 2003. Due to the bankruptcy activity during
2004, the Company had no significant influence on Precision operations and
changed from the equity method to the cost method with no effect on net loss.
In July 2002, the Company acquired the new Food Products segment, which is Mt.
Franklin Holdings LLC and subsidiaries Franklin. Franklin operates a retail
nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing company located in El Paso,
Texas, and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility located in Ciudad
Juarez, Mexico see Note 3.
The Company is a subsidiary of Accel, S.A. de C.V. Accel, which owns
approximately 577% of the Company issued and outstanding common shares at
December 31, 2004.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - These consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes are prepared in U.S. dollars, the functional and reporting
currency of Elamex.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America U.S. and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
and majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Effective December 19, 2003, the results of operations of Precision, Metal
Stamping Segment which was previously consolidated are being reported on the
cost method. This was due to the voluntary petition for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy code.
Unaudited financial information for Precision as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows                      2004          2003

Net loss                   2,246       16,709 During the fourth quarter of 2003 Precision encountered circumstances that
indicated that its carrying value may not be recoverable, as such, the Company
engaged an independent company to assist in the valuation of long-lived assets
for impairment. Based on the analysis of future cash flows of the assets group
the Company reported an impairment of Precision long-lived assets of $132
million in December 2003. This impairment is recorded in the statement of
operations as impairment of long-lived assets.
28 During 2003 the Company loaned Precision $15 million in the form of a note
receivable, to meet working capital needs. At December 31, 2004, the Company had
notes receivable from Precision of $15 million.
The Company share of undistributed equity net of amounts receivable from
Precision at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $0.
Elamex also has a 501% investment in Qualcore, S. de R.L. de C.V., a joint
venture company, which manufactures plastics parts and metal parts with GE de
Mexico. Qualcore is jointly managed with GE de Mexico and the investment in the
joint venture is recorded under the equity method.
Unaudited financial information for Qualcore as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows                  In Thousands of U.S. Dollars

respectively, in the form of a note receivable to meet working capital needs. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had notes receivable from Qualcore of
$27 million and $23 million, respectively.
The Company share of undistributed equity deficiency net of amounts
receivable from Qualcore at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $19 thousand and
$864 thousand, respectively.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to
make certain estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE - As of January 1, 2002 the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets which requires, among other things, the
discontinuance of amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives. In addition, the standard includes provisions for the reclassification of
certain existing recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles
out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of reporting units
for purposes of assessing potential impairments of goodwill. SFAS No. 142 also
required the Company to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six
months from the date of adoption. The result of the non-amortization provision
of SFAS No. 142 was a decrease in the net loss of $492 thousand for the year
ended December 31, 2002.
The Company engaged an independent company to assist in the valuation of
goodwill assigned to Precision. The fair value of the operating entity was
determined using a discounted cash flow model. Based on the analysis performed
the Company completed its implementation analysis of goodwill arising from prior
acquisitions and recorded an impairment charge of $853 thousand in the first
quarter of 2002, which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle.
The Company completed its annual impairment test during the first quarter of
2003 and reported an impairment of goodwill of $36 million. The goodwill
affected by the impairment analysis is that recorded at the time of the
acquisition of Precision Tool, Die and Machine Co. in 1999. The primary reason
for the impairment was an increase in required capital expenditures necessary to
replace aging equipment and new capital for business expansion. The Company has
elected to annually test goodwill for impairment during the first quarter of the
year and whenever an indication of impairment occurs. As a consequence of the
voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
code filed by Precision the Company tested the value of the goodwill in December
2003 and determined an additional impairment of goodwill of $45 million for
Precision goodwill. After impairment, goodwill remaining on the books is
approximately $37 million of goodwill recorded during the third quarter of 2002
as a result of the acquisition of Mt. Franklin Holdings See Note 3. The
Company
29 completed its annual impairment test of the Franklin goodwill in the first
quarter of 2004 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments and investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. Cash includes deposits in Mexican banks,
denominated in Mexican Pesos Pesos, of approximately $199 thousand and $0
thousand at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company had
approximately $19 million and $23 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, in short-term repurchase agreements, denominated in U.S. dollars,
deposited in U.S. banks.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts
receivable. The Company monitors the risk of having deposits in bank in excess
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits and does not anticipate any
losses. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral to support amounts due for the sale of its
products.
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable considered
to be uncollectible.
An analysis of the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows                       2004        2003         2002

Ending balance               $  1,301     $  1,275      $   654
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The functional currency of the Company is the
U.S. dollar, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the
Company operates. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and
remeasurement of balance sheet amounts are reflected in net income. Included in
other, net on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are foreign
exchange losses of $46 thousand, $211 thousand, and $328 thousand for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Assets and liabilities of
the Company are denominated in U.S. dollars except for certain amounts as
indicated below. Certain balance sheet amounts primarily inventories, property,
plant and equipment, accumulated depreciation, prepaid expenses, and common
stock denominated in other than U.S. dollars are remeasured at the rates in
effect at the time the relevant transaction was recorded, and all other assets
and liabilities are remeasured at rates effective as of the end of the related
periods. Revenues and expenses denominated in other than U.S. dollars are
remeasured at weighted-average exchange rates for the relevant period the
transaction was recorded. Assets and liabilities denominated in Pesos are
summarized as follows in thousands of U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
published in the Diario Oficial de la Federacion the Official Gazette of the
Federation, which is the approximate rate at which a receivable or payable can
be settled as of each period end                       2004        2003
In Thousands of U.S. Dollars
Cash and cash equivalents         $   199     $
Other receivables                509        854

Accounts payable                309       189
Accrued expenses and other liabilities    1,231       546
Net foreign currency position       $  486     $ 1,406
In addition, the Company has recorded a net deferred tax liability pursuant to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes see Note 10. The recorded net deferred tax asset of $621 thousand
and $885 thousand at December 31, 2004 and 2003 respectively, represent the net
dollar value of amounts provided for temporary differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective Mexican and U.S. tax bases.
30 FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS - The Company maintains a policy of not engaging in
futures contracts with the purpose of hedging U.S. dollar/Peso revenues or
costs, with the exception of regular treasury operations to cover operating
requirements for up to 30 days. The Company had no open hedge contracts at
December 31, 2004 or 2003.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined using a moving weighted average. Inventory cost includes material,
labor and overhead. Inventory reserves, which are charged to cost of sales, are
provided for excess inventory, obsolete inventory, and for differences between
inventory cost and its net realizable value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Plant and equipment under
capital leases are stated at the lower of their fair value at the inception of
the lease or the present value of minimum lease payments. Depreciation and
amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of
related lease terms or estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company charges
amounts expended for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalizes
expenditures for major replacements and improvements.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company measures impairment losses on long-lived assets,
including goodwill, when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might
be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the carrying amounts of those assets. The Company measures
impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value
of the asset.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for the stock option plans under
APB Opinion No. 25, under which compensation cost of $42 thousand and $223
thousand were recognized in 2004 and 2003, respectively. No additional
compensation expense will be expensed in the future in connection with these
options. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent with
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the Company net loss
and loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, would
have been adjusted to the following pro forma amounts                              In Thousands of U.S. Dollars, Except per Share Data
2004      2003     2002
Net loss as reported                       $ 5,151  $ 34,608  $  6,017
Stock based employee compensation expense included in
reported net loss                           42      223      321
Total stock-based employee compensation expense
determined under fair value based method                46      282     440
Pro forma net loss                        $ 5,147  $ 34,667  $  6,136
Loss per share Basic and Diluted
As reported                      $  069  $  461  $  084
Pro forma                         069     462     085
BASIC AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE - Basic and diluted net loss per share of
common stock is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding for the year. Dilutive stock options for the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 have not been included in the calculation as
their effect would be antidilutive due to the net loss.
INCOME TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, as required by SFAS No. 109. Under the asset and liability
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Provisions for taxes are made based
upon the applicable tax laws of Mexico and the United States. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and
liabilities that are remeasured from Pesos into U.S. dollars using historical
exchange rates and that result from inflation indexing for Mexican tax purposes
or exchange rate changes.
31 REVENUE RECOGNITION - For metal stamping and food products, sales are recognized
at the time the order is shipped in satisfaction of customer orders. For
contract manufacturing, sales are recognized when the order is shipped for
manufacturing contracts and over the contract period for assembly services.
Anticipated losses on assembly services contracts are charged to operations as
soon as they are determined.
EMPLOYEE STATUTORY PROFIT-SHARING - A provision for deferred employee statutory
profit-sharing in Mexico is computed on income subject to employee statutory
profit-sharing, which differs from net income, due to certain differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for statutory profit-sharing and financial
statement purposes. There has been no employee statutory profit-sharing expense
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS - Employees in Mexico are entitled to certain benefits
upon retirement after 15 years or more of service seniority premiums, in
accordance with the Mexican Federal Labor Law. The benefits are accrued as a
liability and recognized as expense during the year in which services are
rendered.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying amounts of financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, accrued expenses,
notes payable, taxes payable, and amounts due to related parties, approximated
fair value as of December 31, 2004 because of the relatively short maturity of
these instruments. The fair values of floating rate long-term debt are estimated
to be equivalent to their carrying amount based on current market conditions.
ACCRUED REBATES - The Company enters into contractual agreements for rebates on
certain products with its customers. Such amounts are netted against sales and
included in accrued advertising and promotions based on management estimates at
the date the sales occur.
PREPAID SLOTTING ALLOWANCES - Prepaid slotting allowances consist of payments to
customers for store shelf space and distribution agreements and are amortized to
sales revenue, using the straight line method over the term of the customer
contract or proportionally with sales recorded, based on the nature of the
slotting contract. Contracts generally vary in length from one to seven years
and provide for fixed payments or payments upon achievement of sales benchmarks.
Prepaid slotting allowances of $652 thousand and $13 million are included on
the balance sheet as other assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 respectively.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004 Statement 123R,
Share-Based Payment, which revised Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. This statement supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The revised statement addresses the
accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees and other third
parties, eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation
transactions using APB 25, and requires that the compensation costs relating to
such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The
revised statement is effective as of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2005. The Company is allowed to select from three alternative
transition methods, each having different reporting implications. The Company
has not completed its evaluation of the methods of adopting Statement 123R.
Accordingly, the impact of adoption of Statement 123R cannot be predicted at
this time because it will depend on the method of adoption selected and on
levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had the Company
adopted Statement 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would
have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of
pro forma net loss and net loss per share in the stock-based compensation
accounting policy note included in the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 153 Statement 153, Exchanges of
Nonmonetary Assets--an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29. Statement 153 amends
the guidance in APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions,
based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured
based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. The guidance in that Opinion,
however, included certain exceptions to that principle. Statement 153 amends
Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange
has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions of Statement
153 are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The provisions of Statement 153 are not expected
to have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements.
In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No. 151, Inventory Costs--An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 SFAS 151.
SFAS 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing , to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs, and wasted material
32 spoilage. Among other provisions, the new rule requires that items such as
idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs
be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
criterion of so abnormal as stated in ARB No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151
requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of
conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS
151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and is required
to be adopted by the Company on January 1, 2006. The company is currently
evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect
SFAS 151 to have a material impact.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
to the 2004 financial statement presentation.
3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS
Effective at the close of business on July 4, 2003, the sale of certain assets
was made to TECMA Group LLC, a private contract, shelter and manufacturing
services provider headquartered in El Paso, Texas. The transaction included the
sale of five Shelter Services customer contracts, miscellaneous assets and stock
of five newly created companies. Substantially all Shelter Services operations
personnel related to these contracts were transferred to the buyer. Elamex
received approximately $18 million in cash. In connection with the disposition
the Company transferred assets with a book value of $120 thousand to the buyer
and recorded a gain of $17 million. The Company incurred other costs of
approximately $575 thousand associated with the sale, which were included in
operating expenses in the 2003 results of operations.
On July 18, 2002, Elamex USA, Corp. Elamex USA, a wholly owned Delaware
subsidiary of Elamex, completed the acquisition of Mt. Franklin Holdings, LLC
Franklin, Franklin Food Products LLC and the merger of Reprop Corporation
with and into Elamex USA. The effective closing date for tax and accounting
purposes was the close of business on June 28, 2002. Franklin operates a retail
nut and foodservice nut packaging and marketing company, whose operations are
located in El Paso, Texas and a candy manufacturing and packaging facility in
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. The purchase price was cash payment of $1,445,040 and
923,161 restricted shares of the common stock of Elamex. 278,499 of these shares
were contingent and subject to escrow agreements, which required Franklin to
reach certain income levels through December 31, 2003. Franklin did not reach
the required income level; therefore the 278,499 shares in escrow will be
canceled or used for a different purpose.
The unaudited proforma combined historical results of the Company, as if
Franklin had been acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2002, are estimated in the
following table                         In Thousands of U.S. Dollars,
Except Per Share Data

Net loss per share                      148 The above proforma results include adjustments to give effect to intercompany
sales, depreciation and other purchase price adjustments. The proforma results
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred
had the acquisition been consummated as of the beginning of the period
presented, nor are they necessarily indicative of future operating results.

34 8. LEASES
Prior to September 16, 2004, the Company financed, via a capital lease
arrangement with a related party, a candy production plant located in Juarez,
Mexico. This arrangement specified that, at the end of the lease term in
November 2010, the Company would purchase the building at a specified price. On
September 16, 2004, the Company and the related party entered into an agreement
eliminating the purchase commitment. The transaction resulted in a deemed sale
and subsequent leaseback of the property through the original lease term. At the
date of the lease modification, land and buildings with a net book value
aggregating $24 million and $81 million, respectively, and the related
obligation under capital leases of $115 million were removed resulting in a
deferred gain of $11 million. The deferred gain is being amortized through the
remaining lease term ending in November 2010. For the year ended December 31,
2004, the amount of deferred gain recognized amounted to $53 thousand.
The Company utilizes certain machinery and equipment and occupies certain
buildings under both capital and operating lease arrangements that expire at
various dates through 2010, some of which have renewal options for additional
periods. Rental expense under these operating lease agreements aggregated $69
million, $67 million, and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003, and 2002, respectively.
Future minimum lease obligations at December 31, 2004 having an initial or
remaining term in excess of one year are as follows                 YEAR        CAPITAL  OPERATING

for general maintenance.
Rental income was $17 million, $15 million, and $882 thousand for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The future minimum rental
income to be received under these operating leases is $17 million in 2005.
9. INCOME TAXES
Mexican tax legislation requires that companies pay a tax calculated as the
greater of tax resulting from taxable income or tax on the value of certain
assets less certain liabilities asset tax. Taxes resulting from net income are
calculated using Mexican tax regulations, which define deductibility of expenses
and recognize certain effects of inflation.
Effective January 1, 1999, a tax rate was enacted in Mexico whereby the
corporate tax rate was 35%. An amount equal to 30% is paid on taxable earnings
reinvested in the Company and 5% on those earnings when they are distributed in
the form of dividends for the year ended December 31, 2001.
On December 1, 2004, certain amendments to the tax and asset tax laws were
enacted and are effective as of 2005. The most significant amendments are as
follows: a the tax rate will be reduced to 30% in 2005, 29% in 2006 and 28% in
2007 and forward; b for purposes of the calculation of income tax, purchases
of inventory are deductible only after being sold; the tax law previously
allowed for the immediate deduction of all inventory purchases in the year
acquired; c companies must establish a tax basis for their inventory balances
as of December 31, 2004 using the specific costing methods allowed by the
35 amendments to the tax law; companies may elect to ratably step-up such tax basis
of inventories over a period from 4 to 12 years, as determined in conformity
with the respective tax rules, which include deducting from the tax basis
certain items such as unamortized tax loss carryforwards; d beginning January
1, 2006, paid employee statutory profit sharing will be fully deductible for tax
purposes; e bank liabilities and liabilities with foreign entities are
deductible in the determination of the asset tax taxable base, thereby
decreasing the base on which the asset tax is calculated.
The tax provision differs from the statutory tax rate of 33% in 2004 and 34% for
2003 and 35% for 2002 on taxable income as follows                          2004   2003   2002

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future.
The valuation allowances of $141 million and $98 million at December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003, respectively, relate primarily to certain asset tax
credit and tax net operating loss carryforwards of individual Mexican
subsidiaries and the entire net deferred tax asset of the US companies. The
increase in the valuation allowance at December 31, 2004 to $136 million
relates primarily to the expiration of certain asset tax credits and capital
loss carryforwards of individual Mexican subsidiaries, and the effect of
reserving the entire net deferred asset tax related to the US companies. In
addition, primarily as a result of the voluntary petition for reorganization
filed by Precision under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on December 19,
2003, the Company investment in Precision, reported under the equity method of
accounting, was reduced by an increase in the valuation allowance against
Precision underlying deferred tax assets of $45 million.
An analysis of the activity of the valuation allowance for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as follows                                2004       2003          2002

The Mexican net asset taxes paid, adjusted for inflation, may be used to offset
income taxes that exceed the asset tax due for the year, for ten years following
the payment of the tax. These asset tax carryforwards as of December 31, 2004
are $46 million and expire on various dates through 2014.
37 At December 31, 2004, certain of the Mexican companies had tax net operating
loss carryforwards that can be utilized only by the Mexican company that
incurred the losses. These net operating loss carryforwards, adjusted for
inflation, expire as follows, if not utilized to offset taxable income YEAR                          AMOUNT

The majority stockholder has filed a consolidated tax return with Elamex
operations since 1995. The tax sharing agreement entered into between the
majority stockholder, Accel, S.A. de C.V., and Elamex through 1998 provided that
Elamex transfer monthly an amount equal to its estimated tax payment, less
credits. Beginning in 1999, the Mexican tax law for consolidation required
Elamex and its subsidiaries to pay amounts directly to the Mexican Tax Authority
SHCP based on their individual tax calculations. The payments are calculated
as required by the SHCP as if Elamex and subsidiaries were filing a stand-alone
income tax return for such year. The majority stockholder further agrees to
reimburse Elamex for use of any of Elamex tax benefits at the time Elamex
would otherwise realize the benefit.
Dividends paid by Mexican companies, which exceed earnings, and profits, as
defined by the Mexican income tax law, are subject to a 33% income tax, payable
by the Company on 15152 times the amount in excess of earnings and profits.
Dividends paid which do not exceed earnings and profits are not currently
subject to Mexican tax to either the Company or the stockholder. The Mexican
companies paid no dividends on common stock in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
COMMON STOCK - Under the bylaws and Mexican law, the capital stock of Elamex,
S.A. de C.V. must consist of fixed capital and may have, in addition thereto,
variable capital. Stockholders holding shares representing variable capital
common stock may require the Company, with a notice of at least three months
prior to December 31 of the prior year, to redeem those shares at a price equal
to the lesser of either i 95% of the market price, based on the average of
trading prices in the stock exchange where it is listed during the 30 trading
days preceding the end of the fiscal year in which the redemption is to become
effective or ii the book value of the Company shares as approved at the
meeting of stockholders for the latest fiscal year prior to the redemption date.
In July 2002, the Company issued 923,161 restricted shares of its authorized
variable capital common stock in connection with the acquisition of Mt. Franklin
Holdings see Note 3. Although the variable capital common stock is redeemable
by the terms described above, such shares would be classified as a component of
stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes the
variable common stock represents permanent capital because the timing and
pricing mechanisms through which a stockholder would exercise this option to
redeem are such that a stockholder, from an economic standpoint, would not
exercise this option. At the time a stockholder is required to give notice of
redemption, the stockholder will not be able to know at what price the shares
would be redeemed and would not expect the present value of the future
redemption payment to equal or exceed the amount which would be received by the
stockholder in an immediate public sale.
Under Mexican law, dividends must be declared in Pesos. If dividends are
declared in the future, the Company intent is to pay the dividends to all
stockholders in U.S. dollars, as converted from Pesos as of the date of record,
unless otherwise instructed by the stockholder.
Mexican law requires that at least 5% of the Company net income each year
after profit sharing and other deductions required by the law be allocated to
a legal reserve fund, which is not thereafter available for distribution, except
as a stock dividend, until the amount of such fund equals 20% of the Company
historical capital stock. The legal reserve fund at December 31, 2004 and 2003
was approximately $16 million. The Company anticipates that no additional
allocation will be made at its annual stockholders' meeting to be held on April
28, 2005. There were no retained earnings available for dividends under Mexican
law at December 31, 2004 and 2003.
COMMON STOCK PURCHASE RESTRICTIONS AND PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS - Any person who seeks
to acquire ownership of 15% or more of the total outstanding shares of the
Company common stock must receive written consent from the Company Board of
Directors. Should shares in excess of 15% be acquired without permission, the
purchaser will be subject to liquidated damages, which will be used by the
Company to repurchase stock in excess of the 15% ownership
38 limitation. In addition, in the event that the Company issues additional shares,
existing stockholders will have a preemptive right to subscribe for new shares,
except when shares are issued in connection with a merger or for the conversion
of convertible debentures. The 15,000,000 shares of variable capital are not
subject to preemptive rights.
PREFERRED STOCK - Pursuant to the Company bylaws, the Company Board of
Directors, at its discretion, can issue up to an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares
of preferred stock in one or more series. The Board may attach any preferences,
rights, qualifications, limitations, and restrictions to the shares of each
series issued, including dividend rights and rates, conversion rights, voting
rights, terms of redemption, and liquidation preferences. The shares may be
issued at no par value or at a par value determined by the Board of Directors.
No shares of preferred stock have been issued as of December 31, 2004.
11. STOCK OPTION PLANS
On April 19, 2002, the shareholders approved the issuance of up to 850,000
Elamex stock options and authorized the Board of Directors to establish the
terms and conditions of the grant of the stock options.
On July 19, 2002, the Board of Directors of the Company granted 200,000 stock
options at $200 per share and 70,730 stock options at $600 per share. During
the quarter ended September 30, 2004, 200,000 stock options were forfeited due
to the termination of a senior executive. During the second and third quarter of
2003, 38,210 and 25,020, options respectively, were forfeited due to the
resignation of one of the awarded executives during the second quarter and two
awarded executives during the third quarter.

Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions; risk free
interest rate of 268%; expected dividend yield of 00%; expected life of 5
years and expected volatility of 61%.
In addition to the above, Franklin, a subsidiary of the Company has an options
plan in shares of the subsidiary. There are 50,000 options outstanding under
this plan with an exercise price of $1287. No compensation expense has been
recorded in connection with this plan. Also, based on an analysis of these
options using the Black-Scholes method, the Company believes the fair value of
such options is zero and no proforma expense is recorded in connection with
these options.
12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company and its subsidiaries sponsor 401k defined contribution plans.
Participants in the plans may contribute up to 10% of their salary for which the
Company provides matching or discretionary contributions. In 2004, 2003 and
2002, approximately $7 thousand, $120 thousand and $118 thousand, respectively,
have been charged to expense in connection with these plans.
39 Prior to its acquisition by the Company, Franklin had a 401k Savings Plan for
eligible Franklin employees as defined in the plan agreement. The 401k Savings
Plan provides for discretionary matching contributions. For the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 Franklin approved matching contributions of 100% of

The Company paid for services rendered by Comercial Aerea, of which the chairman
of the board of directors of Elamex is a principal, totaling approximately $31
thousand, $148 thousand, and $127 thousand during the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
The Company purchases insurance through an insurance broker of which the
chairman of the board of Elamex is a principal. Premiums paid were approximately
$153 thousand, $337 thousand, and $393 thousand for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Confecciones de Juarez
Confecciones, leases a candy manufacturing building owned by Franklin
Inmobiliarios S.A. de C.V. Inmobiliarios, a Mexican company in which the
chairman of the board has an indirect ownership interest. The building, located
in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, is the site on which all of Franklin candy
manufacturing operations are performed. Confecciones passes the cost of this
lease to Franklin under the terms of a shelter services agreement executed on
July 24, 2000 Shelter Contract. Shelter services companies generally lease
real properties in the normal course of arranging shelter services for a US
company. This lease agreement was executed on November 22, 2000, which was prior
to the July 1, 2001 date on which Elamex acquired Franklin. On September 16,
2004, the Company and the related party entered into an agreement eliminating
the purchase commitment. The lease modification resulted in a change in the
lease from a capital lease to an operating lease see note 8.
The rights to collect lease payments from Confecciones have been assigned by
Inmobiliarios to the bank that financed the
41 building. Franklin made lease payments directly to that bank on behalf of
Inmobiliarios in the amounts of $20 million, $19 million and $19 million
during 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.
During 2004 the Company loaned Qualcore $425 thousand in the form of a note
receivable, to meet working capital needs. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company had notes receivable from Qualcore of $27 million and $23 million,
respectively.
16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various claims, actions, and complaints, the ultimate
disposition of which, in the opinion of management, will not have a material
adverse effect on the operations or financial position of the Company.
The Mexican Federal Labor Law requires a severance payment for all permanent
employees that are terminated by the employer. This payment is calculated on the
basis of 90-days' pay for termination anytime during the first year of
employment, with an additional 12 days pay for each year of service thereafter
up to two times minimum wage. While most of the Company Mexican assembly labor
is hired under temporary labor contracts during the first two months of
employment, the labor force is changed to permanent labor contracts after this
period. The Company has agreements with many of its contract-assembly customers,
which require that the customers pay the severance costs incurred, in the event
that assembly contracts are terminated prior to their scheduled completion. In
management opinion, any severance costs incurred upon the termination of any
manufacturing contracts would not be material.
Seniority premiums to which employees are entitled upon retirement after 15
years or more of service, in accordance with the Mexican Federal Labor Law, are
recognized as expense during the year in which services are rendered. Included
in other liabilities is approximately $30 thousand and $20 thousand as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which fully accrues for these
estimated seniority obligations.
One of the Company subsidiaries has entered into certain fixed-price
commitments to purchase raw materials to be used in its manufacturing process
over the next year. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate value of these
commitments was approximately $296 million.
On February 21, 2005, one of the Company customers filed Chapter 11 under the
United States Bankruptcy Court. The Company received payments of approximately
$226,000 within ninety days of the filing date that were paid outside of terms
and subject to possible preference action by the Trustee for the bankruptcy
estate. The payments received relate to 2004 sales and there were no sales to
this customer in 2005. Based on a review of the facts and circumstances,
management has provided an accrual, in other accrued expenses, of $135,000,
which is believed to be a reasonable estimate of the probable loss associated
with this matter.
17. GUARANTEES
In November 2002, Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation FIN No. 45,
Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others was issued. FIN No. 45 requires a
Company, at the time it issues a guarantee, to recognize an initial liability
for the fair value of obligations assumed under the guarantee and to expand
existing disclosure requirements. The Company has entered into contracts in the
normal course of business, which include certain guarantees within the scope of
FIN 45 under which it could be required to make payments to third parties upon
the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain future events. These guarantees
primarily include 1 Qualcore, the joint venture with GE de Mexico, entered into a 12-year lease
agreement beginning January 2001 for the building that it occupies in Celaya
Mexico. The monthly lease payments are approximately $94,628 and are guaranteed
by both Elamex and GE de Mexico. Although the likelihood of funding under this
guarantee is not considered by the Company to be probable, the maximum amount
the Company may be liable for under such guarantee is approximately $45
million.
2 Qualcore also obtained bank financing from Wells Fargo and Eximbank for the
plastic molding and metal stamping equipment for the Celaya plant in 2001. The
original notes payable totaled $84 million with a five-year term and have equal
semi-annual principal payments of $840 thousand plus interest. Guarantors
include Elamex S.A de C.V. and GE Mexico, S.A. de C.V.
The guarantors are defined as primary obligors and guarantee the amounts as
follows For Tranche A of $981 thousand.
a.  Elamex - 100    b.  GE Mexico - 499 Both parties are liable jointly and severally up to 499%.
42 For Tranche B of $24 million.
a.  Elamex - 501    b.  GE Mexico 499 The guarantors' liability under Tranche B is several, but not joint.
As of December 31, 2004 the bank debt was approximately $34 million and
Qualcore was in default under the loan agreement.
On January 1, 2005 the bank executed a forbearance agreement with Qualcore. The
forbearance agreement provides Qualcore with a period of 120 days in which the
bank will not issue a demand for payment of any or all of the outstanding debt.
However, the bank did not waive the existing default. Should Qualcore not be
able to make the payments within the forbearance period, the bank will require
the guarantors to pay the debt.
The maximum liability exposure of Elamex is considered to be 501% of the total
bank debt and as of December 31, 2004 Elamex recorded a liability of $17
million in recognition of the probability that it will be obligated to perform
under this guarantee.
