Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Forrester Research, Inc.: In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Forrester Research, Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
statements, and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation Principles of Consolidation Forrester Research, Inc.
Forrester or the Company is an independent research company that provides pragmatic and forward-thinking advice to global leaders in business and technology. Forresters products and services are targeted to specific
roles, including senior management in business strategy, marketing, and information technology principally at $1billion-plus revenue companies who collaborate with Forrester to accelerate achievement of their business goals. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Forrester and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Management Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Forrester considers the more
significant of these estimates to be revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, non-marketable investments, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, and valuation and impairment of marketable investments. On an ongoing basis, management
evaluates its estimates. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Reclassifications 
Certain line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been combined to conform to the current period presentation. 
Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain financial assets recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value
measurements. Level1 Fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Level2 Fair value based on inputs other than Level1 inputs that are observable, either
directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities. Level3 Fair value based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and such inputs are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The carrying amounts reflected
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Investments Forrester considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of 90days or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys investments with an
auction reset feature and for which the Company does not have the ability to sell within one year from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. 
F-7 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Companys investments are composed of securities of U.S.government
agencies, municipal notes some of which contain an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ARS, corporate notes and bonds, and money market funds. Forrester accounts for all marketable investments as
available-for-sale securities and as such, the marketable investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses not related to credit losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Realized gains and losses on securities are included in earnings and are determined using the specific identification method. The Company conducts periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss, in accordance
with the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to certain investments, as required under current accounting standards. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its
amortized cost basis. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities that are determined to be temporary, and not related to credit loss, are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The determination of whether a loss is
considered temporary is based in part on whether the Company intends to sell the security or whether the Company would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. During the years
ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges on its available-for-sale securities. Concentrations of Credit Risk Forrester has no significant
off-balance sheet or concentration of credit risk such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts, or other foreign hedging arrangements. Financial instruments that potentially subject Forrester to concentrations of credit risk are principally
cash equivalents, marketable investments, and accounts receivable. Forrester places its investments in highly rated securities. No single customer accounted for greater than 2% of revenues or accounts receivable in any of the periods presented.
Deferred Commissions Commissions incurred in acquiring new or renewing existing contracts, which are earned in the month that a contract is booked, are deferred and expensed to operations as the related revenue is recognized.
Forrester evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date. Goodwill 
Goodwill is not amortized; however, it is required to be tested for impairment annually. Furthermore, testing for impairment is required
on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred. An impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
Absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist, the Company has selected November30 as the date for performing the annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill impairment charges have not been required for the years ended
December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Impairment of Other Long-Lived Tangible and Intangible Assets
Forrester continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated
remaining useful life of long-lived assets and intangible assets may warrant revision or if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired. To compute whether assets have been impaired, the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value. To the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the assets are written down to the estimated fair
value of the asset. 
F-8 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Non-Current Liabilities 
The Company records certain liabilities that are expected to be settled over a period that exceeds one year as non-current liabilities.
The Company also records as a non-current liability the portion of the deferred rent liability that is expected to be recognized over a period greater than one year. Non-current deferred rent liability at December31, 2011 and 2010 was $67
million and $05 million, respectively, and primarily results from the difference between cash payments and the straight-line recognition of rent expense under the Companys facility leases. The portion of the deferred rent corresponding to
rent payments that will be paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date is classified as a current liability. 
Foreign Currency The functional currency of the majority of Forresters wholly-owned subsidiaries is their respective local currencies. These subsidiary financial statements are translated to U.S.dollars using
period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the corresponding period for revenues and expenses, with translation gains and losses accumulated as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains
and losses related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency are included in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the years ended
December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Forrester recorded $13 million, $14million and $11million of foreign exchange losses, respectively, in other income, net. In addition, Forresters German holding companies, for which the
functional currency is the U.S. dollar, recognized $01million, $04million and $06million of remeasurement gains losses on its deferred tax liability in income tax expense for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Revenue Recognition 
Effective January1, 2011 the Company adopted Update No2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a
consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2009-13 for contracts entered into or materially modified after that date. ASU 2009-13 updates the previous multiple-element revenue
F-9 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
arrangements guidance. The revised guidance primarily provides three significant changes: 1 it eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered
element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting; 2 it eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration; and 3 it modifies the fair value requirements of EITF Issue 00-21 by providing
best estimate of selling price in addition to vendor specific objective evidence and vendor objective evidence for determining the selling price of a deliverable. In addition, the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for
revenue recognition. The adoption of ASU 2009-13 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Forrester generates revenues from licensing research including our data products, performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events. Forrester executes contracts that govern the
terms and conditions of each arrangement. Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, services have been provided to the customer, and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue
contracts may include either a single product or service or a combination of multiple products and services. Revenues from contracts that contain multiple products and services are allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their
relative selling prices; however, the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions. The Company obtains the selling prices of its products and services based on an analysis of standalone sales of
these products and services during the year. Research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project
revenues, which are short-term in nature and based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided. Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as advisory services revenue. Event revenues are recognized upon completion of
the event. Annual subscriptions to our RoleView research include access to all or a designated portion of our research, and
depending on the type of license, membership in one or more of our Forrester leadership boards, unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry, unlimited participation in Forrester Teleconferences, and the right to attend one event. Contracts for RoleView
research entered into prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January1, 2011 are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period. Contracts for RoleView research entered
into or significantly modified after January1, 2011 are accounted for as two units of accounting: 1 the event ticket and 2 the remaining research services that are delivered throughout the contract period, based on the new guidance that
permits alternative methods of determining selling price as it relates to the components that we do not sell on a standalone basis, such as research services in this case. Arrangement consideration is allocated to each of these elements based upon
their relative selling prices, which is based on standalone sales of event tickets and the estimated selling price of the remaining research services. Annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and
access to a data specialist, which are delivered throughout the year, and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period. Clients are offered a service guarantee, which
gives them the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes the fair value of
stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the individual grantee, which generally equals the vesting period. Cash flows resulting from the tax benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized
for stock-based awards are classified as financing cash flows. The Company is required to estimate future forfeitures of stock-based awards for recognition of compensation expense. The Company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures
are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated. The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that
F-10 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
vest. In addition, for performance-vested restricted stock units, the Company makes estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that
will be earned. The actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest. Stock-based compensation expense was recorded in the following expense categories in thousands: Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Cost of services and fulfillment 1,644 2,094 2,961 Selling and marketing 751 943 1,123 General and administrative 1,247 1,837 2,027

The options granted under the equity incentive plans and shares subject to the employee stock purchase
plan were valued utilizing the Black Scholes model using the following assumptions and had the following fair values:  Years Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 EquityIncentivePlans EmployeeStockPurchase Plan EquityIncentivePlans EmployeeStockPurchase Plan EquityIncentivePlans EmployeeStockPurchase Plan Average risk-free interest rate 125 013 193 017 185 029 Expected dividend yield None None None None None None Expected life 35Years 05Years 36Years 05Years 35Years 05Years Expected volatility 40 28 40 25 44 44 Weighted average fair value 1047 755 967 638 838 681
The dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that Forrester had never paid cash dividends until the
board of directors approved a special dividend of $300 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2010. Expected volatility is based, in part, on the historical volatility of Forresters common stock as well as managements expectations of
future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted. The risk-free interest rate used is based on the U.S.Treasury Constant Maturity rate with an equivalent remaining term. Where the expected term of a stock-based award does not
correspond with a term for which the interest rates are quoted, Forrester uses the rate with the maturity closest to the awards expected term. The expected term calculation is based upon Forresters historical experience of exercise
patterns. The unamortized fair value of stock-based awards as of December31, 2011 was $52million, with a weighted average remaining recognition period of 15 years. 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Forrester maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments. When evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts, customer concentrations, current economic trends, and changes in the customer payment
terms. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of the Companys customers
were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly.

Income Taxes Forrester recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities as well
as operating loss carryforwards. Forresters provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred provision
for federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The current provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated as the net change during the year in
deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are provided if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Forrester accounts for uncertain tax positions using a more-likely-than-not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain
tax positions. The evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters
subject to audit, new audit activity, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. The Company evaluates these tax positions on a quarterly basis. The Company also accrues for potential interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Net Income Per Common Share 
Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the diluted weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common equivalent
shares outstanding has been determined in accordance with the treasury-stock method. Common stock equivalents consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.

Basic and diluted weighted average common shares are as follows in thousands:

Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 23,164 23,063 22,884 
For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, options to purchase approximately
03million, 04million and 20million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the diluted weighted average common share calculation as the effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
New Accounting Pronouncements In May2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures. The new guidance clarifies the concepts applicable
for fair value measurement of non-financial assets and requires the disclosure of quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement. This guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after
December15, 2011, and will be applied prospectively. The Company does not anticipate a material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance. 
In June2011, the FASB amended its accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income OCIin an
entitys financial statements. The amended guidance eliminates the option to present the components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and provides two options for presenting OCI: in a statement included in the
income statement or in a separate statement immediately following the income statement. The amendments do not change the guidance for the items that have to be reported in OCI or when an item of OCI has to be moved into net income. This guidance
will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2011. The Company does not anticipate that its adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated results. 
In September2011, the FASB issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. The updated guidance gives
companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The amendment is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the
annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate that its adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated results. 2
Acquisitions 
Springboard Research On May12, 2011, Forrester acquired Springboard Research Springboard, a provider of research and advisory services focused on Asia Pacific and emerging markets. Springboard was a former
division of Knowledge Platform, Inc. The acquisition of the Springboard business further supports Forresters role-based strategy and expands Forresters coverage in the Asia Pacific region. The total purchase price was approximately
$90million, of which approximately $67million was paid on the acquisition date and $23million the Holdback is payable at various times through June1, 2013, subject to possible reduction to satisfy
indemnification claims and specified contingencies. Of the $23million Holdback, up to $04million can be

retained by the Company if certain key employees do not remain with the Company through May12, 2012. In addition, up to $05 million of the Holdback could have been retained by the Company
if a certain Springboard facility lease had not been extended through September15, 2012. As of December31, 2011, $05 million of the Holdback had been paid by the Company and $09 million and $09million of the Holdback are
recorded in accrued expenses and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The results of Springboard, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been included in Forresters
consolidated financial statements since May12, 2011 in the Technology Industry Client Group segment. Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.

Strategic Oxygen On December1, 2009, Forrester acquired the Strategic Oxygen business to further support the Companys role-based strategy. The total purchase price was approximately $73million, of which
approximately $46million was paid on the acquisition date, $05million was paid in 2010 and $04million was paid in June 2011. The remaining purchase price of $18million represented contingent purchase price valued as of
December1, 2009, which was subject to adjustment based on the achievement of certain financial metrics related to the acquired business. Of the $18million contingent purchase price, $02million was paid in December 2009

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
and $12million was paid in February 2010 as full consideration. The Company recorded a credit of approximately $05million within general and administrative expense during 2010 as a
result of a reduction in the estimated amount of contingent purchase price from December31, 2009 to the final calculation date. The results of Strategic Oxygen, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements, have been
included in Forresters consolidated financial statements since December1, 2009 in the Technology Industry Client Group segment. Pro forma financial information has not been provided as it is not material to the consolidated results of
operations. An agreement existed between an employee of Strategic Oxygen, who became an employee of Forrester upon the closing of the
acquisition, and the seller of Strategic Oxygen that provided for an allocation of a portion of the contingent consideration from the seller to the employee. The contingent consideration was earned by the seller based upon the financial performance
of Strategic Oxygen for a short period of time subsequent to the acquisition. Forrester was not a party to this agreement; however, this payment in the amount of $02million paid to Forresters employee by the seller is considered to have
resulted in services that benefited Forrester, and therefore the payment was required to be recorded as a non-cash compensation expense, within general and administrative expense, by Forrester and as a capital contribution to Forrester by the seller
in 2010. Forrester Middle East FZ-LLC On January22, 2009, Forrester acquired all of the outstanding share capital of Forrester Middle East FZ-LLC FME, a Dubai, UAE based reseller of Forresters products that also offered
consulting services to local customers, to expand the Companys direct geographical presence in the area. The total purchase price was approximately $11million of which approximately $06million was paid on the acquisition date 02million was paid in 2009 and $03million was contingent upon the acquired company meeting certain financial metrics, which were not met and accordingly the final $03million was not required to be paid by Forrester. The Company
recorded a credit of $03million within general and administrative expense during 2009 as a result of the reduction in the contingent purchase price. The results of FMEs operations, which were not material to the consolidated financial
statements, have been included in Forresters consolidated financial statements since January22, 2009, with the revenue included within the client group segment to which it relates. Pro forma financial information has not been provided as

$10 million included in cash and cash equivalents. Level 2 assets consist of the Companys entire portfolio of federal, state, municipal and corporate bonds, excluding those municipal bonds described below with an auction reset feature. Level 2
assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, typically utilizing third party pricing services or other market observable data. The pricing services utilize industry standard
valuation methods, including both income and market based approaches and observable market inputs to determine value. These observable market inputs include reportable trades, benchmark yields, credit spreads, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers,
current spot rates and other industry and economic events. Level 3 assets at December31, 2011 and 2010 consist entirely
of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature ARS. Prior to 2008, the fair value of the ARS investments approximated par value due to the frequent resets through the auction process. While the Company continues to earn interest on its ARS
investments at the contractual rate, these investments trade infrequently and therefore do not have a readily determinable market value. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the ARS no longer approximates par value. At December31, 2011,
the Company held ARS with one investment advisor. The Company values the ARS using a discounted cash flow model that includes estimates of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums and expected holding periods of
the securities, which is considered a Level 3 valuation. The valuation resulted in an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of $14 million at December31, 2011 and $19million at
December31, 2010. The Company believes that the loss is

temporary due to the strong underlying credit rating of the securities and the fact that the Company does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be required to sell the
securities. The assumptions used in valuing the ARS are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change. Through July1, 2010, the Company also held ARS with UBS AG UBS. Historically, UBS provided a valuation utilizing Level 3 inputs for the ARS investments. UBS utilized a discounted cash flow
approach to arrive at its valuation, which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis prepared by the Company. The assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included estimates, based on data
available at each balance sheet date, of interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods of the ARS. In November2008, the Company accepted an offer the Right from UBS
entitling the Company to sell at par value ARS originally purchased from UBS at any time during a two-year period from June30, 2010 through July2, 2012. The Company valued the Right as an asset using a discounted cash flow approach
including estimates of interest rates and timing and amount of cash flows, adjusted for any bearer risk associated with UBSs financial ability to repurchase the ARS beginning June30, 2010, based on data available at each balance sheet
date. The combined fair value of the Right and the UBS ARS historically equaled the par value of the UBS ARS. The remaining $54million of par value UBS ARS at June30, 2010 were sold to UBS at par under the Right on July1, 2010.

One of the Companys investments, with a book value of $15million and $17million at December31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, is being accounted for using the cost method and, accordingly, is valued at cost unless an other-than-temporary impairment in its value occurs. The other investments are being accounted for using the equity method as the investments
are limited partnerships and Forrester has an ownership interest in excess of 5% and, accordingly, Forrester records its share of the investees operating results each period. During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the
Company recorded gains losses from its non-marketable investments of approximately $10million, $23million and $10million, respectively, which

$05million, $05million and $01million, respectively, were received from the funds. In June 2010, the
Company extended the expiration date of a cash bonus plan, originally adopted in 2000, that would pay a bonus, after the return of invested capital from certain of the Companys non-marketable investments, to certain key employees. To date, no
bonuses have been paid under the plan and no amounts are accrued as of December31, 2011 as payments under the plan were not considered probable. The plan will now automatically expire on June30, 2013, subject to earlier expiration as
provided in the plan in the event that prior to such date there are less than 10 participants in the plan or all of the Companys invested capital as defined in the plan has been returned to the Company. 6

liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company considers all available
evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset. Judgment is required in considering the relative impact of
negative and positive evidence. In arriving at these judgments, the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured,
based upon the Companys historical taxable income and projections of the Companys future taxable income over the periods during which

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net
of the existing valuation allowances, as discussed below. As of December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company maintained a
valuation allowance of approximately $31million and $27million, respectively, primarily relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards from an acquisition and U.S.capital losses. 
As of December31, 2011, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $128million obtained from
acquired businesses. These carryforwards are limited pursuant to section382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to changes in ownership as a result of the acquisitions. If unused, these carryforwards would expire on various dates from 2019
through 2028. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $316million, which can be
carried forward indefinitely. Approximately $58million of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards relate to a prior acquisition, the utilization of which is subject to limitation under the tax law of the United Kingdom. The Company has a
German net operating loss against which it had provided a full valuation allowance in prior years. During 2010 the Company reconsidered its position and determined that the ability of the Company to benefit from the net operating loss did not meet
the more likely than not standard. Accordingly, the deferred tax asset and corresponding valuation allowance for the German net operating loss have been removed from the components of deferred taxes with no effect to the Companys overall tax
provision. As of December31, 2011, the Company had U.S.federal and state capital loss carryforwards of
$30million, of which $10million expires in 2012, $11million expires in 2014, and $09 million expires in 2016. The following table provides a summary of the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 in thousands: 2011 2010 2009 Deferred tax valuation allowance at January 1 2,676 11,672 10,922 Additions 508 440 1,532 Deductions 85 9,405 1,261 Translation adjustments 22 31 479 
Deferred tax valuation allowance at December 31 3,077 2,676 11,672 
During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized approximately
$05million, $18 million and $03million, respectively, of net tax benefits deficiencies from tax deductions in excess of or less than book deductions resulting from employee stock option exercises. The net tax benefits
deficiencies were recorded as an increase decrease to additional paid-in-capital. Excess tax benefits from share-based payments are recognized in the year that the deduction reduces the amount of cash payable for taxes. 
Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $14 million as of December31, 2011. The
Company has not provided any additional federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings as such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in the business. Due to the various methods by which such earnings
could be repatriated in the future, the amount of taxes attributable to the undistributed earnings is not practicably determinable. The Company utilizes a two step process for the measurement of uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken on a tax return. The first step is a determination of whether the
tax position 
F-23 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
should be recognized in the financial statements. The second step determines the measurement of the tax position. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits
is summarized as follows for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 in thousands:  2011 2010 2009 Unrecognized tax benefits at January 1 1,222 919 1,222 Additions for tax positions of prior years 107 410 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 19 Additions for tax positions of current year 17 77 Settlements Lapse of statute of limitations 77 184 284 
Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 1,269 1,222 919 
As of December31, 2011, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $13
million, all of which if recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate in a future period. Based on the potential outcome of the Companys global tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions,
it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits related to intercompany activity will decrease within the next 12 months. The associated net tax benefits, which would favorably impact the effective tax rate, are estimated to be in the
range of $0 to $04 million. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax
expense and such amounts were not material in the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. At December31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had approximately $02 million of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S.and in foreign jurisdictions. Generally, the Company is no longer
subject to U.S., state, local and foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities in its major jurisdictions for years before 2005, except to the extent of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards from those years. Major taxing
jurisdictions include the U.S., the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  7

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
On April1, 2008, the Company issued to its employees options to purchase
370,000shares of common stock. These options were subject to performance criteria and would vest only if certain operating profit targets related to full year 2008 performance were achieved. The vesting of these options was over 24, 36 or
48months, or the options could be forfeited, depending on the actual operating profit achieved for 2008. During 2008, operating performance was expected to result in the options vesting over 48months and expense was recognized assuming
that vesting period. The actual operating profit targets for 2008 resulted in accelerated vesting of the options over 24months and the compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting was recognized on a prospective basis through
the remainder of the vesting period. The expense related to these options was recognized on a graded basis. Restricted
Stock Units Restricted stock units RSUs represent the right to receive one share of Forrester common stock
when the restrictions lapse and the vesting conditions are met, and are valued on the date of grant based upon the value of the Companys stock on the date of grant. In 2009, the Company issued to its employees 95,496 performance-based RSUs. The vesting of the RSUs is subject to performance criteria and will vest at 100% or 40% on April1, 2012, or the RSUs could
be forfeited, depending on whether specified revenue growth and certain operating margin targets related to full year 2011 performance are achieved. Based on 2011 financial performance, 40% of the then outstanding RSUs will vest on April1,
2012. Compensation expense in 2010 and 2009 was recognized based on an estimate of 100% vesting of the RSUs and in 2011 the Company modified it assessment of vesting to the 40% level. 
In 2010, the Company issued to its employees approximately 63,000 performance-based RSUs. The vesting of the RSUs is subject to

shares under the Stock Purchase Plan. The price at which the employees shares are purchased is the lower of: a85% of the closing price of the common stock on the day that the purchase period commences, or b85% of the closing
price of the common stock on the day that the purchase period terminates. In October 2011, the Stock Purchase Plan was amended effective for purchase periods commencing in 2012 and beyond to provide for the following: 1 modification of the purchase
periods such that beginning in 2012, purchase periods will commence on each successive March1 and September1, 2 institution of a one-year holding period for all shares purchased under the Stock Purchase Plan, and 3 elimination of the

Employee Pension Plans 
Forrester sponsors several defined contribution plans for eligible employees. Generally, the defined contribution plans
have funding provisions which, in certain situations, require contributions based upon formulas relating to employee wages or the level of elective participant contributions, as well as allow for additional discretionary contributions. Further,
certain plans contain vesting provisions. Forresters contributions to these plans totaled approximately $30million, $28million and $20million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
10Reorganization
2009 Reorganization During the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced a reduction of its workforce by approximately 50 positions in response to conditions and demands of the market and a slower economy. Additionally,
Forrester identified certain leased office space that was no longer required to support the ongoing business. As a result, Forrester recorded a reorganization charge of approximately $31million in the three months ended March31, 2009.
Approximately 44% of the terminated employees were members of the sales force, while 38% and 18% held research and administrative roles, respectively. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2009, Forrester
F-28 Table of Contents FORRESTER RESEARCH, INC. 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
incurred additional reorganization costs of $23million related to facility consolidations primarily in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Of the $23million fourth quarter 2009 charge,
approximately $14million related to future lease payments through September 2011 and $09million related to the write-off of leasehold improvements. 2012 Reorganization In the first quarter of 2012 the Company realigned its
sales force to simplify the selling process to customers and to increase the productivity of the sales organization. The Company incurred approximately $04 million of severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 for three sales employees located
outside of the U.S. based on statutory termination benefits in their country of employment and the fact that termination was considered probable at December31, 2011. The Company anticipates incurring an additional $13 million to $15 million
of severance and related costs in 2012 related to the sales reorganization and other cost reduction initiatives. The activity

11Operating Segment and Enterprise Wide Reporting 
Forrester is organized into three client groups with each client group responsible for writing relevant research for
the roles within the client organization on a worldwide basis. The three client groups are: Business Technology BT formerly Information Technology, Technology Industry TI, and Marketing and Strategy
MS. All of the client groups generate revenues through sales of research and advisory and other service offerings targeted at specific roles within their targeted clients. Each of the client groups consists of research personnel
focused primarily on issues relevant to particular roles and to the day-to-day responsibilities of persons within the roles. Amounts included in the Events segment relate to the operations of the events production department. Revenue
reported in the Events segment consists primarily of sponsorships and event tickets to Forrester events. Forrester evaluates
reportable segment performance and allocates resources based on direct margin. Direct margin, as presented below, is defined as operating income excluding sales expenses, certain marketing and fulfillment expenses, stock-based compensation expense,
general and administrative expenses, depreciation expense, amortization of intangible assets and reorganization costs. In the first quarter of 2010, the Company modified its calculation of segment direct margin to exclude all sales expenses.
Accordingly, the 2009 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Forrester does not identify or
allocate assets, including capital expenditures, by operating segment. Accordingly, assets are not being reported by segment because the information is not available by segment and is not reviewed in the evaluation of performance or making decisions
in the allocation of resources.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December31, 2011. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect material misstatements. Further, because of
changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Management assessed the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011. In making its assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that as of December31, 2011, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those
