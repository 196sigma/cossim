Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and incorporated
herein by reference.
CUSTOMERS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE
Gardner Denver sells its products through independent distributors and sales
representatives and directly to OEMs, engineering firms and end-users. The
Company has been able to establish strong customer relationships with
numerous key OEMs and exclusive supply arrangements with many of our
distributors. The Company uses a direct sales force to service OEM and
engineering firm accounts because these customers typically require higher
levels of technical assistance, more coordinated shipment scheduling and
more complex product service than customers of our less specialized
products. As a majority of its products are marketed through independent
distribution, the Company is committed to developing and supporting its
distribution network of over 1,000 distributors and representatives. The
Company has distribution centers in Memphis, Tennessee and St. Peters,
Missouri that stock parts, accessories and small compressor and vacuum
products in order to provide adequate and timely availability. The Company
also leases sales office and warehouse space in various U.S. locations and
foreign countries. Gardner Denver provides its distributors with sales and
product literature, technical assistance and training programs, advertising
and sales promotions, order-entry and tracking systems and an annual
restocking program. Furthermore, the Company participates in major trade
shows and has a telemarketing department to generate sales leads and support
the distributors' sales staffs.
Gardner Denver distributors maintain an inventory of complete units and
parts and provide aftermarket service to end-users. There are several
hundred field service representatives for Gardner Denver products in the
distributor network. The Company service
5 personnel and product engineers provide the distributors' service
representatives with technical assistance and field training, particularly
with respect to installation and repair of equipment. The Company also
provides aftermarket support through its remanufacturing facilities in
Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Worth, Texas; and Mayfield, Kentucky and its 14
vehicle fitting facilities. The Indianapolis operation remanufactures and
repairs air ends for rotary screw compressors, blowers and reciprocating
compressors. The Fort Worth facility repairs and remanufactures well
servicing pumps, while the Mayfield operation provides aftermarket parts and
repairs for centrifugal compressors. The vehicle fitting facilities provide
preventative maintenance programs, repairs, refurbishment, upgrades and
spare parts for access platforms and vehicle systems.
COMPETITION
Competition in the Company markets is generally robust and is based on
product quality, performance, price and availability. The relative
importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific type of
product. Given the potential for equipment failures to cause expensive
operational disruption, the Company customers generally view quality and
reliability as critical factors in their equipment purchasing decision. The
required frequency of maintenance is highly variable based on the type of
equipment and application.
Although there are a few large manufacturers of compressor and vacuum
products, the marketplace for these products remains highly fragmented due
to the wide variety of product technologies, applications and selling
channels. Gardner Denver principal competitors in sales of compressor and
vacuum products include Ingersoll-Rand, Sullair owned by United
Technologies Corporation, Atlas Copco, Quincy Compressor owned by EnPro
Industries, CompAir, Roots, Busch, SiHi, Thomas Rietschle, GHH owned by
Ingersoll Rand, Civacon and Blackmer Mouvex both owned by Dover
Corporation and Sening. Gardner Denver primary competitors in sales of
access platforms and vehicle systems include Mellow Flowtrans, Winton
Engineering and Versalift.
The marketplace for fluid transfer products, although dominated by a few
multinational manufacturers with a broad product offering, is still highly
fragmented, as the ten largest pump manufacturers account for only
approximately 40% of annual sales. Because Gardner Denver is currently
focused on pumps used in oil and natural gas production and well servicing
and well drilling, it does not typically compete directly with the major
full-line pump manufacturers. The Company principal competitors in sales
of petroleum pump products include National-Oilwell and SPM Flow Control,
Inc. The Company principal competitors in sales of water jetting systems
include NLB Corp., WOMA Apparatebau GmbH and Hammelmann Maschinenfabrik
GmbH. The Company principal competitors in sales of other fluid transfer
components and equipment are OPW Engineered Systems owned by Dover
Corporation and Kanon in distribution applications; and FMC Technologies
and Schwelm Verladetechnik GmbH SVT in both marine and distribution
technolgies.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Compressor and vacuum and fluid transfer products are best characterized as
mature, with evolutionary technological advances. Technological trends in
compressor and vacuum products include development of oil-free air
compressors, increased product efficiency, reduction of noise levels and
advanced control systems to upgrade the flexibility and precision of
regulating pressure and capacity. Emerging compressor and vacuum market
niches result from new technologies in plastics extrusion, oil and natural
gas well drilling, field gas gathering, mobile and stationary vacuum
applications, utility and fiber optic installation and environmental impact
minimization, as well as other factors. Trends in fluid transfer products
include development of larger horsepower and lighter weight pumps and
loading arms to convey natural gas.
The Company actively engages in a continuing research and development
program. The Gardner Denver research and development centers are dedicated
to various activities, including new product development, product
performance improvement and new product applications.
Gardner Denver products are designed to satisfy the safety and performance
standards set by various industry groups and testing laboratories. Care is
exercised throughout the manufacturing and final testing process to ensure
that products conform to industry, government and customer specifications.
Expenditures for research and development were $62 million in 2004, $28
million in 2003 and $24 million in 2002.
MANUFACTURING
In general, the Company manufacturing processes involve machining castings
and forgings, which are assembled into finished components. These components
are sold as finished products or packaged with purchased components into
complete systems. Gardner Denver operates thirty-two manufacturing
facilities including remanufacturing facilities that utilize a broad
variety of processes. At the Company manufacturing locations, it maintains
advanced manufacturing, quality assurance and testing equipment geared to
the specific products that it manufactures, and uses extensive process
automation in its manufacturing operations. Most of the Company
manufacturing facilities utilize computer aided numerical control tools and
manufacturing techniques that concentrate the equipment necessary to produce
similar products in one area of the plant cell manufacturing. One operator
using cell
6 manufacturing can monitor and operate several machines, as well as assemble
and test products made by such machines, thereby improving operating
efficiency and product quality while reducing the amount of work-in-process
and finished product inventories.
Gardner Denver has representatives on the American Petroleum Institute
working committee and has relationships with standard enforcement
organizations such as Underwriters Laboratories, Det Norske Veritas and the
Canadian Standard Association. The Company maintains ISO 9001-2000
certification on the quality systems at a majority of its manufacturing and
design locations.
RAW MATERIALS
The primary raw materials used by Gardner Denver are cast iron and steel.
Such materials are generally available from a number of suppliers. The
Company does not currently have long-term contracts with its suppliers of
raw materials, but it believes that its sources of raw materials are
reliable and adequate for its needs. Gardner Denver utilizes single sources
of supply for certain iron castings and other selected components. A
disruption in deliveries from a given supplier could therefore have an
adverse effect on its ability to meet its commitments to customers.
Nevertheless, the Company believes that it has appropriately balanced this
risk against the cost of sustaining a greater number of suppliers. Moreover,
the Company has sought, and will continue to seek, cost reductions in our
purchases of materials and supplies by consolidating purchases, pursuing
alternate sources of supply and using online bidding competitions among
potential suppliers.
BACKLOG
Backlog consists of orders believed to be firm for which a customer purchase
order has been received or communicated. Since orders may be rescheduled or
canceled, backlog does not necessarily reflect future sales levels. For
further discussion of backlog levels, see the information included under
Outlook contained in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
The Company believes that the success of its business depends more on the
technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of its employees
than on any individual patent, trademark or copyright. Nevertheless, as part
of its ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, Gardner
Denver has a policy of seeking to protect its proprietary products, product
enhancements and processes with appropriate intellectual property
protections.
In the aggregate, patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to
the manufacturing and marketing of many of Gardner Denver products.
However, the Company does not consider any single patent or trademark, or
group of patents or trademarks, to be material to its business as a whole,
except for the Gardner Denver trademark. Other important trademarks the
Company uses include Nash, Elmo Technology, DuroFlow, Sutorbilt,
CycloBlower, Wittig, Lamson, Tamrotor, OPI, Champion, Geoquip, Belliss &
Morcom, Hoffman, Emco Wheaton, Drum, AirDrive, Webster and Perolo. Joy is a
registered trademark of Joy Technologies, Inc. The Company has the right to
use the Joy trademark on aftermarket parts until November 2027. Its right to
use this trademark on air compressors expired in November 1995. Pursuant to
trademark license agreements, Cooper Industries has rights to use the
Gardner Denver trademark for certain power tools and the Company has rights
to use the Ajax trademark for petroleum pump products. Gardner Denver has
registered its trademarks in the countries where it is deemed necessary.
The Company also relies upon trade secret protection for its confidential
and proprietary information and routinely enters into confidentiality
agreements with its employees. There can be no assurance, however, that
others will not independently obtain similar information and techniques or
otherwise gain access to the Company trade secrets or that they can
effectively be protected.
EMPLOYEES
As of January 2005, the Company had approximately 3,800 full-time employees.
The Company believes that its current relations with employees are
satisfactory.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws
and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, disposal and
discharge of materials into the environment. The Company believes that its
existing environmental control procedures are adequate and it has no current
plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area. Gardner Denver has
an environmental policy that confirms its commitment to a clean environment
and to compliance with environmental laws. Gardner Denver has an active
environmental management program aimed at compliance with existing
environmental regulations and developing methods to eliminate or
significantly reduce the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing
processes.
The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party PRP
with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal
Superfund or similar state laws, which impose liability for cleanup of
certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages. Persons
potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site
owner or operator and persons that disposed
7 or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites.
Although these laws impose joint and several liability, in application, the
PRPs typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the
volume of waste contributed by each PRP. Based on currently available
information, Gardner Denver was only a small contributor to the substantial
majority of these waste sites, and the Company has, or is attempting to
negotiate, de minimis settlements for their cleanup. The cleanup of the
remaining sites is substantially complete and the Company future
obligations entail a share of the sites' ongoing operating and maintenance
expense.
Gardner Denver has an accrued liability on its balance sheet to the extent
costs are known or can be estimated for its remaining financial obligations
for these matters. Based upon consideration of currently available
information, the Company does not anticipate any materially adverse effect
on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or competitive
position as a result of compliance with federal, state, local or foreign
environmental laws or regulations or cleanup costs relating to the sites
discussed above.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
- 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and notes thereto.
OVERVIEW
The Company believes it is one of the leading designers, manufacturers and
marketers of engineered stationary air compressors, liquid ring pumps and
blowers for various industrial and transportation applications and of pumps
used in the petroleum and industrial markets and other fluid transfer
equipment serving chemical, petroleum and food industries.
Since its spin-off from Cooper Industries, Inc. in 1994, the Company has
completed 17 acquisitions, growing its revenues from approximately $176
million to $740 million in 2004. Of the 17 acquisitions, the two largest
were completed in 2004 with the purchase of nash_elmo Holdings, LLC Nash
Elmo and Syltone plc Syltone.
On September 1, 2004, the Company acquired Nash Elmo, a leading global
manufacturer of industrial vacuum pumps. Nash Elmo is primarily split
between two businesses, liquid ring pumps and side channel blowers. Both
businesses' products are complementary to the Compressor and Vacuum Products
segment existing product portfolio. Nash Elmo, previously headquartered in
Trumbull, CT, has primary manufacturing facilities located in Bad Neustadt
and Nuremberg, Germany; Zibo, China; and Campinas, Brazil. For the year
ended December 31, 2003, Nash Elmo revenues and earnings before income
taxes were $2124 million and $78 million, respectively. Nash Elmo
largest markets are in Europe, Asia, North America and South America.
Approximately 70% of Nash Elmo revenues are generated from liquid ring
pump products including related engineered systems and aftermarket
services, while the remaining 30% are derived from side channel blower
products including aftermarket services.
9
On January 2, 2004, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of Syltone,
previously a publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Syltone, previously headquartered in Bradford, United Kingdom U.K., is
one of the world largest manufacturers of equipment used for loading and
unloading liquid and dry bulk products on commercial transportation
vehicles. This equipment includes compressors, blowers and other ancillary
products that are complementary to the Company existing product lines.
Syltone is also one of the world largest manufacturers of fluid transfer
equipment including loading arms, swivel joints, couplers and valves used
to load and unload ships, tank trucks and rail cars. For the twelve months
ended September 30, 2003, Syltone generated revenues and operating profit
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.K. of
pound844 million and pound63 million, respectively approximately
$1511 million and $113 million, respectively as calculated using the
December 31, 2003 exchange rate of $179/pound. Syltone largest markets
are Europe and North America, which represent approximately 67% and 20% of
its revenues, respectively. Approximately 70% of Syltone revenues are
generated through transportation-related activities while the remaining 30%
are derived from fluid transfer-related activities.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Nash Elmo and Syltone, the Company
continues to be organized based upon the products and services it offers and
has four operating divisions: Compressor, Blower, Liquid Ring Pump and Fluid
Transfer. These divisions comprise two reportable segments, Compressor and
Vacuum Products formerly Compressed Air Products and Fluid Transfer
Products. The Compressor, Blower which now includes the Syltone
transportation-related activities and Nash Elmo side channel blower
business and Liquid Ring Pump consisting of Nash Elmo liquid ring pump
business Divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment Compressor
and Vacuum Products since the long-term financial performance of these
businesses are affected by similar economic conditions, coupled with the
similar nature of their products, manufacturing processes and other business
characteristics. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company former Pump
and Fluid Transfer which consisted of the Syltone fluid transfer-related
activities Divisions were combined into one division, Fluid Transfer. These
two divisions were previously aggregated into one reportable segment Fluid
Transfer Products primarily due to the same factors as noted above, and
thus, there has been no change to the Fluid Transfer Products segment.
In the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment, the Company designs,
manufactures, markets and services the following products and related
aftermarket parts for industrial and commercial applications: rotary screw,
reciprocating, sliding vane and centrifugal compressors; positive
displacement, centrifugal and side channel blowers; and liquid ring pumps
and engineered systems. Stationary air compressors are used in
manufacturing, process applications and materials handling, and to power air
tools and equipment. Blowers are used primarily in pneumatic conveying,
wastewater aeration, numerous applications in industrial manufacturing and
engineered vacuum systems. Liquid ring pumps are used in many different
vacuum applications and engineered systems, such as water removal,
distilling, reacting, efficiency improvement, lifting and handling, and
filtering, principally in the pulp and paper, industrial manufacturing,
chemical and power industries. Revenues of the Compressor and Vacuum
Products segment constituted 80% of total revenues in 2004.
In the Fluid Transfer Products segment, the Company designs, manufactures,
markets and services a diverse group of pumps, water jetting systems and
related aftermarket parts used in oil and natural gas production, well
servicing and drilling and industrial cleaning and maintenance. This segment
also designs, manufactures, markets and services other fluid transfer
components and equipment for the chemical, petroleum and food industries.
Revenues of the Fluid Transfer Products segment constituted 20% of total
revenues in 2004.
The Company sells its products through independent distributors and sales
representatives, and directly to original equipment manufacturers,
engineering firms, packagers and end users.
The following table sets forth percentage relationships to revenues of
certain income statement items for the years presented.                         2004    2003    2002

-  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
On March 8, 2005, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Thomas Industries Inc. Thomas, a New York Stock Exchange listed company
trading under the ticker symbol TII. Thomas is a worldwide leader in the
design, manufacture and marketing of precision engineered pumps, compressors
and blowers. The agreed-upon purchase price is $4000 per share for all
outstanding shares and share equivalents approximately $734 million and
the assumption of $95 million of long-term capitalized lease obligations.
As of December 31, 2004, Thomas had $267 million in cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments. The net transaction value, including assumed
debt and net of cash, is approximately $476 million.
10 Thomas is a leading supplier of pumps, compressors and blowers to the
original equipment manufacturer OEM market in such applications as medical
equipment, gasoline vapor and refrigerant recovery, automotive and
transportation applications, printing, packaging, tape drives and laboratory
equipment. Thomas designs, manufacturers, markets, sells and services these
products through worldwide operations with regional headquarters as
follows: North American Group - Sheboygan, Wisconsin; European Group -
Puchheim, Germany; and Asia Pacific Group - Hong Kong, China.
Thomas has wholly-owned operations in 21 countries on five continents. Its
primary manufacturing facilities are located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin,
Monroe, Louisiana, Skokie, Illinois and Syracuse, New York; Schopfheim,
Fahrnau, Puchheim and Memmingen, Germany; and Wuxi, China. The manufacturing
operations in the United States produce rotary vane, linear, piston and
diaphragm pumps and compressors, and various liquid pumps. These products
are directly sold worldwide to OEM, as well as through fluid power and
industrial distributors. The German operations manufacture a complementary
line of rotary vane, linear, diaphragm, gear, side channel, radial, claw,
screw and rotary lobe pumps, compressors and blowers, as well as various
liquid pumps, air-centers and centralized systems. These products are also
distributed worldwide. The manufacturing facility in China was constructed
during late 2004 and will begin production in mid 2005.
Thomas' largest markets are Europe and the United States, which represent
approximately 52% and 38% of its revenues, respectively. Of the total
European sales, approximately 61% are within Germany and 39% are within
other European countries. Approximately 10% of Thomas' revenues are
generated in Asia Pacific. At December 31, 2004, Thomas employed
approximately 2,200 people.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, Thomas' revenues and operating income
were $410 million and $209 million, respectively. Operating income for this
period included $19 million from Thomas' 32% interest in the Genlyte Thomas
Group LLC GTG, a joint venture formed with The Genlyte Group Incorporated
Genlyte in 1998, and a $160 million nonrecurring gain on the sale of this
joint venture in July 2004. For the twelve-month period of 2004, operating
income from Thomas' Pumps and Compressors segment, net of corporate
expenses, was $30 million.
Gardner Denver has received a debt commitment to fully finance the
acquisition of Thomas. However, Gardner Denver intends to finance the
acquisition through an amended and expanded senior secured bank facility and
a public offering of approximately $200 million of its common stock. In
addition, the Company may choose to access the debt capital markets. The
acquisition is not conditioned upon completion of any of these financings
and the size and timing of the equity and any debt financings are subject to
prevailing market conditions.
The acquisition is expected to close in 2005 and is subject to the approval
of Thomas' stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including
the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003
REVENUES
Revenues increased $3000 million 68% to $7395 million in 2004, compared
to $4395 million in 2003. This increase was primarily due to acquisitions
in 2004, which contributed $2473 million in revenues. Increased shipments
of well stimulation pumps, pump parts, compressors and blowers, combined
with changes in currency exchange rates and price increases, also
contributed to this increase. Revenues outside the United States, as a
percentage of total revenues, increased to 56% in 2004, compared to 42% in
2003, primarily due to acquisitions and volume increases in Europe, China
and South Africa.
Revenues for the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment increased $2204
million 60% to $5894 million in 2004, compared to $3690 million in 2003.
This increase is primarily due to acquisitions in 2004 52%, increased
volume of compressor and blower shipments in the U.S., Europe, China and
South Africa 3%, changes in currency exchange rates 3% and price
increases 2%.
Fluid Transfer Products segment revenues increased $797 million to $1502
million in 2004, compared to $705 million in 2003. This 113% increase is
primarily due to the acquisition of Syltone 78%, increased shipments of
well stimulation pumps, water jetting systems and related aftermarket 34%
and price increases 4%. These positive factors were partially offset by a
decreased volume of drilling pump shipments 3%.
COSTS AND EXPENSES
Gross margin increased $1093 million 83% to $2411 million in 2004,
compared to $1318 million in 2003. Gross margin percentage increased to
326% in 2004, compared to 300% in 2003. This increase in gross margin
percentage was principally attributable to the increased volume in both
segments and the related positive impact of increased leverage of fixed and
semi-fixed costs over a higher revenue base. Acquisitions completed in 2004
also positively impacted gross margin percentage, as their gross margin
percentage 351% was higher than the Company
11
previously existing businesses despite a non-recurring negative impact of
approximately $37 million stemming from recording their inventory at fair
value on the respective acquisition dates. Finally, favorable sales mix also
contributed to the increased gross margin as 2004 included a higher
percentage of aftermarket sales compared to the prior year. These positive
factors were partially offset by higher material costs due to surcharges on
castings and other components stemming from increases in scrap iron and
other metal prices. Higher warranty costs and some supply chain
inefficiencies that affected material availability also negatively impacted
gross margin.
Depreciation and amortization increased $73 million to $219 million in
2004, compared to $146 million in 2003, primarily due to the Syltone and
Nash Elmo acquisitions.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $721 million 85% to $1575
million in 2004, compared to $853 million in 2003, primarily due to
acquisitions in 2004 $619 million. Higher compensation and fringe benefit
costs, professional fees and changes in currency exchange rates also
contributed to this increase. As a percentage of revenues, selling and
administrative expenses increased to 213% for 2004 from 194% in the prior
year, primarily due to the 2004 acquisitions.
Other income, net decreased $26 million in 2004 to $06 million, compared
to $32 million in 2003. This change was primarily due to higher foreign
currency transaction gains recorded in 2003. Prior year results included a
$32 million gain in the fourth quarter related to the appreciation of U.S.
dollar borrowings, which were converted to British pounds prior to being
used to consummate the Syltone acquisition. An additional $12 million gain
was recorded related to these borrowings in the first quarter of 2004. Prior
year results also included a $04 million pretax gain on the sale of an idle
manufacturing facility in Syracuse, New York.
The Compressor and Vacuum Products segment generated operating earnings as a
percentage of revenues of 79% in 2004, compared to 75% in 2003. This
increase was primarily attributable to the positive impact of increased
leverage of the segment fixed and semi-fixed costs over a higher revenue
base, favorable sales mix and restructuring programs initiated in the fourth
quarter of 2003. These positive factors were partially offset by higher
material, compensation and fringe benefit and warranty costs. Operating
earnings as a percentage of revenues from Compressor and Vacuum Products
segment businesses that existed prior to the Nash Elmo and Syltone
acquisitions were 79% for 2004.
The Fluid Transfer Products segment generated operating earnings as a
percentage of revenues of 100% in 2004, compared to 58% in 2003. This
improvement was primarily attributable to the positive impact of increased
leverage of the segment fixed and semi-fixed costs over a higher revenue
base, operational improvements and price increases. These positive factors
were partially offset by the impact of the Syltone business included in this
segment which had lower operating earnings as a percentage of revenues than
the segment previously existing businesses. Operating earnings as a
percentage of revenues from Fluid Transfer Products segment businesses that
existed prior to the Syltone acquisition were 136% in 2004.
Interest expense increased $54 million 113% to $101 million in 2004,
compared to $47 million in 2003, due to higher average borrowings stemming
from the Syltone and Nash Elmo acquisitions and higher average interest
rates. The average interest rate was 50% in 2004, compared to 39% in 2003.
See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
on the Company borrowing arrangements.
Income before income taxes increased $219 million 72% to $523 million in
2004, compared to $304 million in 2003. Acquisitions in 2004 contributed
$106 million to this increase. The balance of the increase is primarily due
to the increased volume in both segments and the related positive impact of
increased leverage of fixed and semi-fixed costs over a higher revenue base.
These positive factors were partially offset by higher material,
compensation and fringe benefit and warranty costs.
The provision for income taxes increased by $54 million to $152 million in
2004, compared to $97 million in 2003, as a result of the incremental
income before taxes partially offset by a lower overall effective tax rate.
The Company effective tax rate was lowered to 290% in 2004 compared to
320% in 2003. The lower rate is principally due to favorable tax audit
settlements in Finland and the U.S. of $14 million and $02 million,
respectively. A higher proportion of earnings derived from lower taxed
non-U.S. jurisdictions also contributed to the lower effective tax rate.
These positive factors were partially offset by incremental taxes accrued in
the amount of $09 million for the planned repatriation of certain non-U.S.
earnings in 2005 at a reduced income tax rate pursuant to the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004.
Net income increased $165 million 80% to $371 million $192 diluted
earnings per share in 2004, compared to $206 million $127 diluted
earnings per share in 2003. The increase in net income is primarily
attributable to the same factors that resulted in increased income before
taxes and the lower effective tax rate as noted above. Changes in currency
exchange rates also contributed favorably by increasing net income by
approximately $08 million. Net income included $01 million $001 diluted
earnings per share and $02 million $002 diluted earnings per share in
after-tax LIFO income in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The estimated
incremental impact on diluted earnings per share from acquisitions was $033
in 2004, which was partially offset by a $023 dilutive impact from a stock
offering completed in the first quarter of 2004.
12  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002
REVENUES
Revenues increased $213 million to $4395 million in 2003, compared to
$4182 million in 2002, primarily due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Revenues outside the United States, as a percentage of total revenues,
increased to 42% in 2003, compared to 37% in 2002. This increase is due to
changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro and British pound
and volume increases in Asia and Canada.
Revenues for the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment increased $190
million 5% to $3690 million in 2003, compared to $3500 million in 2002.
Revenues in this segment increased approximately $173 million due to
changes in currency exchange rates. Increased prices contributed
approximately $26 million but were partially offset by lower centrifugal
blower volume.
Revenues in the Fluid Transfer Products segment increased $24 million 4%
to $705 million in 2003, compared to $681 million in 2002. Volume
increases contributed approximately 3 percentage points of the change,
primarily due to increased shipments of well stimulation pumps and petroleum
pump parts which was partially offset by lower drilling pump shipments.
Increased prices contributed the remaining 1 percentage point increase. In
2002, Fluid Transfer Products segment revenues were supported by drilling
pump backlog carried over from 2001 orders.
COSTS AND EXPENSES
During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company announced and initiated
restructuring plans to eliminate redundant manufacturing capacity,
streamline operations and reduce costs. These activities represent further
integration of previously completed acquisitions, which the Company expects
will better leverage existing manufacturing facilities. As a result of the
restructuring, the Company expects to realize a net reduction in headcount
of approximately 80 personnel approximately 4% of its workforce as of
September 30, 2003 by the end of 2005. The substantial majority of this
headcount reduction was realized during the fourth quarter of 2003. As part
of the restructuring program, the Company refocused the marketing strategies
of its German blower business to place more emphasis on the truck blower
market rather than industrial applications for its products. In addition,
the Company exited the marketing and manufacturing of certain highly
engineered compressor packages in the U.K. and U.S. The Company also
announced its plan to implement new manufacturing processes and systems
improvements to reduce inventory and its intent to establish a compressor
packaging and assembly operation in China. The aggregate financial impact of
these profitability improvement programs restructuring plans, inventory
reduction plan and establishment of China operations resulted in a
reduction in diluted earnings per share of approximately $012 in the fourth
quarter of 2003.
Atchison Casting Corporation, the Company largest supplier of iron
castings in 2002, downsized and subsequently closed its LaGrange, Missouri
foundry LaGrange Foundry in the second half of 2002. As a result, the
Company implemented its previously developed contingency plan to secure
alternate supply sources. There was a negative impact on the Company
financial performance estimated at $004-$005 and $001-$003 diluted
earnings per share in 2003 and 2002, respectively as additional costs were
incurred to expedite delivery of castings from new suppliers and accelerate
depreciation expense of pattern modification charges from alternate casting
suppliers who are no longer servicing the Company.
Gross margin increased $33 million 3% in 2003 to $1318 million, compared
to $1285 million in 2002. Gross margin percentage of revenues decreased to
300% in 2003 from 307% in 2002. This decrease in the gross margin
percentage was principally attributable to charges to cost of sales of $21
million incurred in conjunction with implementing the profitability
improvement programs discussed above. This factor contributed 05 percentage
points of the 07 percentage point decrease in gross margin as a percentage
of revenues. Unfavorable sales mix including a lower proportion of drilling
pump and centrifugal blower sales which generate higher gross margins, and a
higher proportion of compressor package sales, which generate lower gross
margins, and incremental costs associated with the disruption in the
Company casting supply chain also contributed to this decrease. These
negative factors were partially offset by cost reduction efforts, including
continued acquisition integration.
Selling and administrative expenses increased by 7% to $853 million in 2003
from $794 million in 2002, primarily due to changes in currency exchange
rates. Selling and administrative expenses increased 4% due to changes in
currency exchange rates and 1% due to expenses associated with the
profitability improvement programs. The remaining increase of 2% was
primarily attributable to higher compensation and postretirement expenses,
which were partially offset by lower medical costs and other cost reduction
efforts, including continued acquisition integration. As a percentage of
revenues, selling and administrative expenses were 194% in 2003, compared
to 190% in 2002. The increase in this ratio was primarily attributable to
the factors discussed above, partially offset by the impact of higher
revenues.
Operating earnings for the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment decreased
$20 million 7% to $278 million, compared to $298 million in 2002. This
decrease was primarily attributable to $27 million of charges incurred in
the fourth quarter of 2003 for the profitability improvement programs.
Higher compensation, postretirement and warranty expenses combined with
costs associated with the disruption within the Company casting supply
chain also contributed to this decrease. These negative factors were
partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates, lower medical costs
and cost reductions efforts, including continued acquisition
13 integration. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings decreased to
75% in 2003, compared to 85% in 2002, as a result of the factors noted
above. The expenses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 related to
implementing the profitability improvement programs contributed 08
percentage points of this 10 percentage point decrease in operating
earnings as a percentage of revenues.
Operating earnings for the Fluid Transfer Products segment decreased $11
million to $41 million in 2003, a 21% decrease from $52 million in 2002.
This decrease was primarily attributable to a less favorable sales mix due
to a lower proportion of revenues from drilling pumps, which generate higher
margins than other pump products. Higher compensation and postretirement
expenses also contributed to this decrease. As a percentage of revenues,
operating earnings for this segment decreased to 58% in 2003, compared to
76% in 2002, as a result of the factors noted above.
Interest expense decreased $16 million 25% to $47 million for 2003,
compared to $64 million in 2002, due to lower average borrowings and
interest rates. The average interest rate for 2003 was 39% compared to 44%
in 2002.
Other income, net increased $30 million to $32 million in 2003 compared to
$02 million in 2002, due to an unrealized currency transaction gain of $32
million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2003. This gain related to the
appreciation of U.S. dollar borrowings, which were converted to British
pounds in November 2003 prior to being used to consummate the Syltone
acquisition in January 2004.
Income before income taxes increased $15 million 5% to $304 million in
2003 from $288 million in 2002. This increase was primarily the result of
the unrealized currency transaction gain, lower interest expense and changes
in currency exchange rates discussed above. These positive factors were
partially offset by the lower operating earnings in each segment.
The provision for income taxes increased by $05 million 5% to $97
million in 2003, compared to $92 million in 2002, as a result of the higher
income before taxes. The Company effective tax rate was 32% in both years.
Net income increased $10 million 5% to $206 million $127 diluted
earnings per share in 2003, compared to $196 million $122 diluted
earnings per share in 2002. Net income included $02 million $002 diluted
earnings per share and $03 million $002 diluted earnings per share in
after-tax LIFO income in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in net
income was primarily attributable to the same factors that resulted in
increased income before taxes discussed above. Changes in currency exchange
rates also contributed favorably by increasing net income by approximately
$08 million in 2003.
OUTLOOK
In 2004, orders for compressor and vacuum products were $6113 million,
compared to $3527 million in 2003. Order backlog for the Compressor and
Vacuum Products segment was $1699 million as of December 31, 2004, compared
to $487 million as of December 31, 2003. The favorable impact from 2004
acquisitions for this segment was approximately $1939 million and $994
million for orders and backlog, respectively, for the year ended and as of
December 31, 2004. Excluding this impact, the increase in orders and backlog
compared to the prior year was primarily due to improvement in industrial
demand in the U.S. and Europe combined with incremental market share gains
in Europe, China and South Africa and favorable changes in currency exchange
rates. The Company also experienced an increase in demand for positive
displacement blowers and locomotive compressors due to an improved
transportation market in the U.S. These positive factors were partially
offset by the Company exit from the marketing and manufacture of certain
highly engineered compressor packages in the U.K. and U.S. in fourth quarter
of 2003.
Because air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process,
demand for compressor and vacuum products is generally correlated to
manufacturing capacity utilization rates and the rate of change of
industrial equipment production. Over longer time periods, demand also
follows the economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the
Gross Domestic Product. These indicators have been relatively weak in both
2004 and 2003 but did improve gradually during 2004. As a result, orders for
compressor and vacuum products are anticipated to improve modestly in 2005
as the U.S. and European industrial economies continue to recover.
Demand for fluid transfer products, which are primarily petroleum related,
has historically corresponded to market conditions and expectations for oil
and natural gas prices. Orders for fluid transfer products were $1757
million in 2004, an increase of $1028 million 141% compared to $729
million in 2003. Order backlog for the Fluid Transfer Products segment was
$523 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $97 million as of December
31, 2003, representing a 442% increase. The increase in orders and backlog
for this segment due to 2004 acquisitions is $555 million and $177
million, respectively. Increased demand for well stimulation pumps, drilling
pumps and petroleum pump parts also contributed to the increase as a result
of elevated prices for oil and natural gas. Future increases in demand for
these products will likely be dependent upon rig counts and oil and natural
gas prices, which the Company cannot predict.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL
During 2004, operating working capital defined as receivables plus
inventories, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $346
million to $962 million compared to $616 million in the prior year
primarily due to the 2004 acquisitions. Inventory
14 turnover decreased to 46 at December 31, 2004, compared to 49 at December
31, 2003. Days sales outstanding improved to 61 days at December 31, 2004,
compared to 63 days at December 31, 2003, due to increased use of progress
billings and improved collections.
CASH FLOWS
During 2004, the Company generated cash flows from operations totaling $768
million, an increase of $305 million 66% compared to 2003. This increase
was primarily the result of acquisitions $228 million and higher net
income from previously existing businesses. Net of cash acquired, $2953
million was used to fund the Nash Elmo and Syltone acquisitions including
direct acquisition costs in 2004. This use of cash was primarily funded by
net borrowings of $847 million, the common stock offering in March 2004
that generated $796 million and excess cash reserves. The effect of
exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was $38 million in 2004
compared to $107 million in 2003. This decrease is primarily due to a
significant strengthening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar
during 2003 combined with the fact that the Company had significant British
pound denominated cash and cash equivalents on hand during the fourth
quarter of 2003 to fund the Syltone acquisition in January 2004. The cash
flows provided by operating and financing activities and used in investing
activities, combined with the effect of exchange rate changes, resulted in a
net cash decrease of $682 million during 2004.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND COMMITMENTS
Capital projects designed to increase operating efficiency and flexibility,
expand production capacity and increase product quality resulted in
expenditures of $196 million in 2004, compared to $120 million in 2003.
This increase was primarily due to 2004 acquisitions, the completion of a
new assembly and packaging facility in China and the integration of certain
businesses onto the Company common enterprise resource planning system.
Commitments for capital expenditures at December 31, 2004 are approximately
$10 million. Capital expenditures related to environmental projects have not
been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the
foreseeable future.
In October 1998, Gardner Denver Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to 1,600,000 shares of the Company common stock to be
used for general corporate purposes. Approximately 200,000 shares remain
available for repurchase under this program. The Company has also
established a Stock Repurchase Program for its executive officers to provide
a means for them to sell Gardner Denver common stock and obtain sufficient
funds to meet income tax obligations which arise from the exercise or
vesting of incentive stock options, restricted stock or performance shares.
The Gardner Denver Board has authorized up to 400,000 shares for repurchase
under this program, and of this amount, approximately 200,000 shares remain
available for repurchase. During 2004, no shares were repurchased under
these repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2004, a total of 1,572,542
shares have been repurchased at a cost of $228 million under both
repurchase programs. In 2004, the Company also acquired 17,799 shares of its
common stock, valued at $05 million, which were tendered for the exercise
of stock options.
LIQUIDITY
On March 6, 2002, the Company amended and restated its then existing
Revolving Line of Credit Agreement the Credit Agreement, increasing the
aggregate borrowing capacity to $1500 million and extending the maturity
date to March 6, 2005. On September 1, 2004, the Company amended and
restated the Credit Agreement once again, increasing the borrowing capacity
to $3750 million. This latter amended and restated Credit Agreement
provided the Company with access to senior secured credit facilities
including a $1500 million five-year Term Loan and a $2250 million
five-year Revolving Line of Credit the Credit Line. Proceeds from the
Credit Agreement were used to fund the Nash Elmo acquisition and retire debt
outstanding under its previously existing Credit Line and Term Loan.
The Credit Line matures on September 1, 2009. On December 31, 2004, the
Credit Line had an outstanding principal balance of $1136 million, leaving
$1114 million available for letters of credit or future use, subject to the
terms of the Credit Line.
The $1500 million Term Loan has a final maturity of September 1, 2009. The
Term Loan requires principal payments totaling $75 million, $150 million 225 million, $375 million and $675 million in years one through five,
respectively. Other terms and conditions of the Term Loan are similar to
those of the Credit Line.
The Company borrowing arrangements permit certain investments and dividend
payments and are generally unsecured with the exception of the Credit
Agreement, which requires the pledge of the stock of certain wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and a security interest in the Company manufacturing
facility in Bad Neustadt, Germany. There are no material restrictions on the
Company as a result of its credit arrangements, other than customary
covenants regarding certain earnings, liquidity and capital ratios.
On September 24, 2003, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC a shelf registration statement regarding $150 million of
its securities. In March 2004, the Company sold 345 million shares of
common stock lowering the amount of securities available on the shelf to
$655 million. On January 31, 2005, the Company filed a second shelf
registration statement regarding $1845 million of its securities, bringing
the total securities currently available to $2500 million. The registration
statement has since been declared effective by the SEC and allows the
Company to complete one or more offerings of its common stock                   15 preferred stock, debt securities or warrants. The Company intends to use the
net proceeds from any offerings for acquisitions, capital expenditures,
repayment of borrowings, working capital and other general corporate
purposes.
As discussed under the Recent Development section above, on March 8, 2005,
the Company executed an agreement and plan of merger Merger Agreement
through which it expects to effectively acquire all the outstanding shares
of Thomas. The Company acquisition of Thomas through the Merger Agreement
is not contingent on the Company ability to finance the transaction.
Simultaneously with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company
executed a Commitment Letter with Bear Stearns & Co., Inc. and JP Morgan
Chase Bank, NA and affiliated parties together, the Commitment Parties.
This Commitment Letter obligates the Commitment Parties, subject to limited
conditions, to provide senior secured credit facilities to the Company in
the aggregate amount of $9300 million if the Company acquisition of
Thomas is consummated. These credit facilities could be used by the Company
to finance the acquisition of Thomas, pay related fees and expenses,
refinance the existing indebtedness of the Company, and finance the
Company continuing operations after the acquisition of Thomas.
Although these credit facilities are available to the Company through the
Commitment Letter, the Company currently plans to finance the Thomas
acquisition through the amendment and expansion of its existing Credit
Agreement, and the issuance of approximately $200 million of its common
stock. In addition, the Company may choose to access the debt capital
markets. The size and timing of the common stock offering and any debt
financings are subject to prevailing market conditions.
Management currently expects the Company cash flows in 2005 to be
sufficient to fund its scheduled debt service and provide required resources
for working capital and capital investments.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
At December 31, 2004, certain of the Company contractual obligations,
including estimated payments due by period, are as follows dollars in
thousands                                    PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD

Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the
normal course of business to meet operational requirements. The above table
excludes $1039 million of other non-current liabilities recorded in the
balance sheet, which primarily consist of pension and other postretirement
liabilities and deferred income taxes, because the timing of payments
related to such liabilities is uncertain. The table also excludes interest
payments on existing debt arrangements. For further information regarding
the Company debt arrangements and related interest rates, see Note 7 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, lawsuits and
administrative actions, which are of an ordinary or routine nature. In
addition, due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and
other primary defendants, the Company has been named as a defendant in an
increasing number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits. The Company has also
been named as a defendant in an increasing number of silicosis personal
injury lawsuits. The plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos
or silica from multiple sources and typically the Company is one of
approximately 25 or more named defendants. In the Company experience, the
vast majority of the plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease for which
the Company bears any responsibility.
Predecessors to the Company manufactured, distributed and sold products
allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits
the Products. The Company has potential responsibility for certain of
these Products, namely: a air compressors which used asbestos containing
components manufactured and supplied by third parties; and b portable air
compressors used in sandblasting operations as a component of sandblasting
equipment manufactured and sold by others. The sandblasting equipment is
alleged to have caused the silicosis disease plaintiffs claim in these
cases.
Neither the Company nor its predecessors ever mined, manufactured, mixed,
produced or distributed asbestos fiber. The asbestos-containing components
used in the Products were completely encapsulated in a protective
non-asbestos binder and enclosed within the subject Products. Furthermore,
the Company has never manufactured or distributed portable air compressors.
The Company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with
multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis
lawsuits. The Company also believes some of the potential liabilities
regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other
parties. The Company uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and
silicosis lawsuits have been immaterial.
16 The Company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis
lawsuits will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity, based
on: the Company anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to
address the risks of such matters; the limited potential asbestos exposure
from the components described above; the Company experience that the vast
majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to
alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the Products;
various potential defenses available to the Company with respect to such
matters; and the Company prior disposition of comparable matters. However,
due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments
could cause a different outcome, there can be no assurance that the
resolution of pending or future lawsuits, whether by judgment, settlement or
dismissal, will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The Company has also been identified as a potentially responsible party with
respect to several sites designated for environmental cleanup under various
state and federal laws. The Company does not own any of these sites. The
Company does not believe that the future potential costs related to these
sites will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, FAS 106-2. FAS 106-2
supersedes Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003, and provides guidance on the accounting,
disclosure, effective date and transition related to the Prescription Drug
Act. FAS 106-2 was effective for the third quarter of 2004. According to an
actuarial assessment, the Company currently provides prescription drug
benefits, which are actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug
benefit, to certain retired and other employees and will therefore qualify
for the subsidy. As a result, the Company accounted for the federal subsidy
attributable to past services as an actuarial gain, which reduced the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. This actuarial gain is then
amortized in future periods in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The federal subsidy
attributable to employee service rendered in current and future periods will
reduce future net periodic postretirement benefit cost as those employees
provide service. The Company has adopted FAS 106-2, resulting in a favorable
impact to diluted earnings per share of $001 in 2004. The favorable impact
to diluted earnings per share in 2005 is expected to be $002.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs - an
amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amends previous guidance
and requires expensing for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage. In addition, the
statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities. SFAS No.
151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of SFAS No. 151 on its future consolidated financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123-R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS
No. 123-R focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for employee services and generally establishes standards
for the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains goods or
services in share-based payment transactions. The Company will adopt SFAS
No. 123-R in the third quarter of 2005 and currently expects an unfavorable
impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $003 to $005, in the
second half of 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, Application
of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction
on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004, FAS 109-1, and Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision
within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, FAS 109-2. FAS 109-1
requires that companies who qualify for the recent tax law deduction for
domestic production activities to account for it as a special deduction
under Statement No. 109 and reduce their tax expense in the period or
periods the amounts are deductible on the tax return. FAS 109-2 allows
companies additional time to evaluate whether foreign earnings will be
repatriated under the repatriation provisions of the new tax law and
requires specific disclosures for companies needing additional time to
complete the evaluation. Both staff positions are effective immediately.
During 2004, the Company determined that approximately $166 million of
existing foreign earnings should meet the requirements of the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 the AJCA. The Company intends to repatriate these
earnings during calendar 2005, as soon as the qualifying requirements are
met. Since these earnings are no longer consider indefinitely reinvested,
the Company accrued $09 million of income tax expense in 2004. In addition,
the Company is evaluating the potential to repatriate other foreign earnings
pursuant to the AJCA. Whether the Company repatriates their foreign earnings
is dependent upon the Company ability to meet the requirements of the AJCA
with respect to these earnings. Until that determination is made, the
Company will make no change in its current intention to indefinitely
reinvest accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except with
respect to the $166 million noted above. The range of additional amounts
that the Company is considering for repatriation under the AJCA is between
zero and $40 million. The potential range of income tax is between zero and
$21 million.
17 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of
the Company financial statements and related notes and believes those
policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Certain of these accounting
policies require the application of significant judgment by management in
selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of
uncertainty. These judgments are based on historical experience, trends in
the industry, information provided by customers and information available
from other outside sources, as appropriate. The most significant areas
involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Management
believes that the amounts recorded in the Company financial statements
related to these areas are based on their best judgments and estimates,
although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions
or conditions.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, which consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead,
are carried at the lower of cost or market value. As of December 31, 2004 975 million 70% of the Company inventory is accounted for on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis with the remaining $409 million 30%
accounted for on a last-in, first-out LIFO basis. Management regularly
reviews inventory for obsolescence to determine whether a write-down is
necessary. Various factors are considered in making this determination,
including recent sales history and predicted trends, industry market
conditions and general economic conditions.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 141 Business Combinations. Among other things, this standard requires
that intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized at
fair value apart from goodwill if they meet one of two criteria - the
contractual-legal criterion or the separability criterion. The Company has
also adopted SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the
provisions of this standard, intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization. All other intangible
assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and other
intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment
annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired. This testing requires comparison of
carrying values to fair values, and when appropriate, the carrying value of
impaired assets is reduced to fair value. During the second quarter of 2004,
the Company completed its annual impairment test and determined that no
impairment existed. While management believes that its estimates of fair
value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such factors as
product volumes, selling price changes, labor and material cost changes,
productivity, interest rates and foreign exchange rates could affect such
valuations.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income
are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These
assumptions include discount rate, rate of compensation increases, expected
rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates. In
accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are
accumulated and amortized over future periods. While management believes
that the assumptions are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
changes in assumptions may affect the Company pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations and future expense or income. In
addition, due to the significant declines in the financial markets in recent
years, the fair value of the plan assets of certain of the Company funded
defined benefit pension plans was less than their accumulated benefit
obligation at December 31, 2004. As a result, the Company has recorded a
cumulative reduction to stockholders' equity accumulated other
comprehensive income in the amount of $56 million after tax as of
December 31, 2004. This non-cash reduction in stockholders' equity did not
impact the Company compliance with its existing debt covenants and could
be reversed in future periods if a combination of factors, including
interest rate increases, improved investment results and contributions,
cause the pension plans to return to or exceed fully funded status. However,
depending upon the performance of the equity and bond markets in 2005 and
beyond, the Company could also be required to record additional charges to
stockholders' equity in the future.
CONTINGENCIES
Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that require
management to exercise judgement both in assessing the likelihood that a
liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of the
potential loss. The most significant contingencies impacting the Company
financial statements are those related to product warranty, personal injury
lawsuits, environmental remediation and the resolution of matters related to
open tax years. For additional information on these matters, see Note 1,
Note 10 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
All of the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than
historical facts, are forward looking statements made in reliance upon the
safe harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
including, without limitation, statements made in Management Discussion
and Analysis, particularly under the caption Outlook. As a general matter,
forward-looking statements are those focused upon anticipated events or
trends and expectations and beliefs relating to matters that are not
historical in nature.
18 Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties and factors
relating to the Company operations and business environment, all of which
are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the
Company. These uncertainties and factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by such
forward-looking statements.
The following uncertainties and factors, among others, could affect future
performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements: 1 the ability to
complete the Thomas acquisition and identify, negotiate and complete future
acquisitions; 2 the speed with which the Company is able to integrate
acquisitions and realize the related financial benefits; 3 the ability to
maintain and to enter into key purchasing, supply and outsourcing
relationships; 4 purchased material cost changes, including surcharges;
5 the ability to effectively manage the transition of iron casting supply
to alternate sources and the skill, commitment and availability of such
alternate sources; 6 the successful implementation of other strategic
initiatives, including, without limitation, restructuring plans, inventory
reduction programs and other cost reduction efforts; 7 the domestic and/or
worldwide level of oil and natural gas prices and oil and gas drilling and
production, which affect demand for the Company petroleum products; 8
changes in domestic and/or worldwide industrial production and industrial
capacity utilization rates, which affect demand for the Company compressor
and vacuum products; 9 pricing of the Company products; 10 the degree
to which the Company is able to penetrate niche and international markets;
11 changes in currency exchange rates primarily between the U.S. dollar,
the euro and the British pound; 12 changes in interest rates; 13 the
ability to attract and retain quality management personnel; 14 market
performance of pension plan assets and changes in discount rates used for
actuarial assumptions in pension and other postretirement obligation and
expense calculations; 15 the continued ability to effectively manage and
defend litigation matters pending, or asserted in the future, against the
Company; 16 the development and acceptance of the Company new product
offerings; 17 the continued successful implementation and utilization of
the Company electronic services; and 18 changes in laws and regulations,
including accounting standards, tax requirements and interpretations or
guidance related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- 
The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates,
as well as European and other foreign currency exchange rates, and
selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards and
swaps, to manage these risks. The Company does not hold derivatives for
trading purposes. The value of market-risk sensitive derivatives and other
financial instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in
market rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to
evaluate these impacts. Based on a hypothetical ten percent change in
interest rates or ten percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across relevant
foreign currencies, principally the euro, British pound and Chinese Yuan if
permitted to float independently of the U.S. dollar, the potential losses
in future earnings, fair value and cash flows are not material to the
Company.
All derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value.
For each derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item. For each
derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
are recognized immediately in earnings. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S.
dollar borrowings that have been designated as hedges on the Company
investment in a foreign subsidiary are included in other comprehensive
income.
To effectively manage interest costs, the Company utilizes interest rate
swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt. Including the impact of
interest rate swaps outstanding, the interest rate on approximately 50% of
the Company total borrowings were effectively fixed as of December 31,
2004. Also as part of its hedging strategy, the Company utilizes purchased
option and forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the
impact of currency fluctuations on transactions, cash flows and firm
commitments. These contracts for the sale or purchase of European and other
currencies generally mature within one year.
Notional transaction amounts and fair values for the Company outstanding
derivatives, by risk category and instrument type, as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, are summarized in Note 12, Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Concentrations
of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments, contained in Item 8.

- 
REPORT ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Gardner Denver management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f. Any system of internal control, no matter
how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that
a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in
conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly,
even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the Company
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation under the framework in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework, management concluded that
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2004, subject to the scope limitation with respect to Nash Elmo as discussed
in the paragraph below.
Gardner Denver acquired Nash Elmo on September 1, 2004. As permitted by SEC
guidance, management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of
Gardner Denver internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, Nash Elmo internal control over financial reporting. Total
assets related to Nash Elmo as of December 31, 2004 were $331 million and
revenues for the four-month period subsequent to the acquisition September
1 - December 31, 2004 were $84 million.
Management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report
which is included herein.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Gardner Denver, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gardner
Denver, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2004. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule II.
These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Gardner
Denver, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Gardner
Denver, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion on management assessment of, and the effective
operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

20 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Gardner Denver, Inc. We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Report
on Management Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
that Gardner Denver, Inc. the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Gardner Denver, Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Gardner Denver, Inc. maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
The Company acquired Nash Elmo on September 1, 2004, and management excluded
from its assessment of the effectiveness of Gardner Denver, Inc. internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, Nash Elmo
internal control over financial reporting. Total assets related to Nash Elmo
at December 31, 2004 of $331 million and revenues for the four-month period
subsequent to the acquisition September 1 - December 31, 2004 of $84
million were included in the consolidated financial statements of Gardner
Denver, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31,
2004. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Gardner
Denver, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over
financial reporting of Nash Elmo.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of Gardner Denver, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2004, and our report dated March 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

GARDNER DENVER, INC.
Dollars in thousands except per share amounts or amounts described in millions
NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of
Gardner Denver, Inc. Gardner Denver or the Company and its
subsidiaries. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform
with current year presentation.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign operations are translated at
the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and
expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the year.
Translation adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income, a separate component of stockholders' equity.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes product revenue when the products are shipped and
title passes to the customer and collection is reasonably assured. Service
revenue is recognized when services are performed and earned and collection
is reasonably assured.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments valued at cost, which
approximates fair value acquired with an original maturity of three months
or less. As of December 31, 2003, pound624 million $1114 million in
cash was deposited on account to acquire the shares of Syltone See Note 2.
These funds were restricted for such use until the acquisition was
consummated. As of December 31, 2004, cash of $53 million was pledged to
financial institutions as collateral to support the issuance of standby
letters of credit and similar instruments on behalf of the Company and its
subsidiaries.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, which consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead,
are carried at the lower of cost or market value. As of December 31, 2004 975 million 70% of the Company inventory is accounted for on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis, with the remaining $409 million 30%
accounted for on a last-in, first-out LIFO basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets: buildings - 10 to 45 years; machinery and equipment - 10 to 12
years; office furniture and equipment - 3 to 10 years; and tooling, dies,
patterns, etc. - 3 to 7 years.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 141 Business Combinations. Among other things, this standard requires
that intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized at
fair value apart from goodwill if they meet one of two criteria - the
contractual-legal criterion or the separability criterion. The Company has
also adopted SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the
provisions of this standard, intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization. All other intangible
assets are amortized over their estimated useful
26 lives. Goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are
tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. This testing
requires comparison of carrying values to fair values, and when appropriate,
the carrying value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value.
The Company uses the straight-line method to amortize intangible assets
subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives, generally 5 to
20 years. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company completed its
annual impairment test and determined that no impairment existed.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of
the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value, less costs to dispose.
PRODUCT WARRANTY
The Company product warranty liability is calculated based primarily upon
historical warranty claims experience. Management also factors into the
product warranty accrual any specific warranty issues identified during the
period which are expected to impact future periods and may not be consistent
with historical claims experience. Product warranty accruals are reviewed
regularly by management and adjusted from time to time when actual warranty
claims experience differs from that estimated.
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income
are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These
assumptions include the discount rate, rate of compensation increases,
expected return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates. In
accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are
accumulated and amortized over future periods.
INCOME TAXES
The Company has determined tax expense and other deferred tax information
based on the liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect
temporary differences between financial and tax reporting.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Costs for research and development are expensed as incurred and were $6,186 2,808 and $2,398 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
All derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value.
For each derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or
loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income
until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item. For each
derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on
the derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
are recognized immediately in earnings. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S.
dollar borrowings that have been designated as hedges on the Company
investment in a foreign subsidiary are included in other comprehensive
income.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
As allowed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company measures its compensation cost of equity instruments issued
under employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment to SFAS No. 123, to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Under
APB No. 25, no compensation cost was recognized for the Company stock
option plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plans
been determined based
27 on the fair value at the grant date for awards outstanding during 2004, 2003
and 2002 consistent with the provisions of this Statement, the Company net
income and earnings per share would have been as shown in the table below                                       2004    2003    2002

Diluted earnings per share, pro forma                  $ 185    119    114
-  Compensation costs charged against income net of tax for restricted stock
issued under the Company Incentive Plan totaled $02 million in 2003.
There were no restricted stock awards in 2004 or in 2002.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Items impacting the Company comprehensive income, but not included in net
income, consist of translation adjustments, including realized and
unrealized gains and losses net of income taxes on the foreign currency
hedge of the Company investment in a foreign subsidiary, fair market value
adjustments of interest rate swaps and additional minimum pension liability
net of income taxes. See Note 8 for further discussion of additional
minimum pension liability adjustments.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 106-2, Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, FAS 106-2. FAS 106-2
supersedes Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003, and provides guidance on the accounting,
disclosure, effective date and transition related to the Prescription Drug
Act. FAS 106-2 was effective for the third quarter of 2004. According to an
actuarial assessment, the Company currently provides prescription drug
benefits, which are actuarially equivalent to the Medicare prescription drug
benefit, to certain retired and other employees and will therefore qualify
for the subsidy. As a result, the Company accounted for the federal subsidy
attributable to past services as an actuarial gain, which reduced the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. This actuarial gain is then
amortized in future periods in accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The federal
subsidy attributable to employee service rendered in current and future
periods will reduce future net periodic postretirement benefit cost as those
employees provide service. The Company has adopted FAS 106-2 resulting in a
favorable impact to diluted earnings per share of $001 in 2004. The
favorable impact to diluted earnings per share in 2005 is expected to be
$002.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs - an
amendment to ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement amends previous guidance
and requires expensing for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material spoilage. In addition, the
statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory be based on the normal capacity of production facilities. SFAS No.
151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of SFAS No. 151 on its future consolidated financial statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123-R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS
No. 123-R focuses primarily on transactions in which an entity exchanges its
equity instruments for employee services and generally establishes standards
for the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains goods or
services in share-based payment transactions. The Company will adopt SFAS
No. 123-R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and currently expects an
unfavorable impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately $003 to
$005, in the second half of 2005.
In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, Application
of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction
on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004, FAS 109-1, and Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision
within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, FAS 109-2. FAS 109-1
requires that companies who qualify for the recent tax law deduction for
domestic production activities to account for it as a special deduction
under Statement No. 109 and reduce their tax expense in the period or
periods the amounts are deductible on the tax return. FAS 109-2 allows
companies additional time to evaluate whether foreign earnings will be
repatriated under the repatriation provisions of the new tax law and
requires specific disclosures for companies needing additional time to
complete the evaluation. Both staff positions are effective immediately and
the required income tax disclosures have been included in Note 10.
28 NOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS
On September 1, 2004, the Company acquired nash_elmo Holdings, LLC Nash
Elmo. Nash Elmo is a leading global manufacturer of industrial vacuum
pumps and is primarily split between two businesses, liquid ring pumps and
side channel blowers. Both businesses' products are complementary to the
Compressor and Vacuum Products segment existing product portfolio. The
purchase price of $2246 million, including assumed bank debt net of cash
acquired and direct acquisition costs, was paid in cash and the assumption
of certain of Nash Elmo debt $104 million. There are no additional
contingent payments or commitments related to this acquisition.
This acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method and,
accordingly, its results are included in the Company consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price
including direct acquisition costs has been allocated primarily to
receivables $35,629; inventory $47,749; property, plant and equipment
$34,461; intangible assets $170,893; other assets $6,880; accounts
payable and accrued liabilities $48,985; net deferred income tax
liabilities $18,515 and other long-term liabilities $3,547, based on
their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. This allocation
reflects the Company preliminary estimates of the purchase price
allocation and is subject to change upon completion of appraisals in 2005.
Further, other assets and liabilities may be identified to which a portion
of the purchase price could be allocated.
The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the intangible
assets acquired in the Nash Elmo acquisition  
Amortized intangible assets:
Customer lists and relationships          $ 44,000
Other                         7,245
Unamortized intangible assets:
Goodwill                       91,648
Tradenames                      28,000
- 
Total intangible assets                    $170,893
- 
The preliminary weighted average amortization period for customer lists and
relationships and other amortized intangible assets is 20 years and 5 years,
respectively. The total amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes is approximately $10 to $15 million. The assignment of
goodwill has been allocated to the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment.
On January 2, 2004, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of Syltone
plc Syltone, previously a publicly traded company listed on the London
Stock Exchange. Syltone, previously headquartered in Bradford, United
Kingdom U.K., is one of the world largest manufacturers of equipment
used for loading and unloading liquid and dry bulk products on commercial
transportation vehicles. This equipment includes compressors, blowers and
other ancillary products that are complementary to the Company product
lines. Syltone is also one of the world largest manufacturers of fluid
transfer equipment including loading arms, swivel joints, couplers and
valves used to load and unload ships, tank trucks and rail cars. The
purchase price of pound630 million or approximately $1125 million,
including assumed bank debt net of cash acquired and direct acquisition
costs, was paid in the form of cash pound463 million, new loan notes
pound52 million and the assumption of Syltone existing bank debt, net
of cash acquired pound115 million. There are no additional contingent
payments or commitments related to this acquisition.
This acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method, and
accordingly, its results are included in the Company consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. The purchase price has
been allocated primarily to receivables $30,382; inventory $20,554;
property, plant and equipment $33,488; intangible assets $90,160;
accounts payable and accrued liabilities $40,581; net deferred income tax
liabilities $1,796 and other long-term liabilities $19,658, based on
their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition.
The following table summarizes the fair values of the intangible assets
acquired in the Syltone acquisition  
Amortized intangible assets:
Customer lists and relationships             $ 8,000
Other                           4,867
Unamortized intangible assets:
Goodwill                         68,803
Tradenames                         8,490
- 
Total intangible assets                    $90,160
- 
The weighted average amortization period for customer lists and
relationships and other amortized intangible assets is 20 years and 5 years,
respectively. The total amount of goodwill that is expected to be deductible
for tax purposes is not anticipated to be significant, given the stock
nature of the acquisition. The assignment of goodwill has been allocated to
the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment $57,194 and the Fluid Transfer
Products segment $11,609. See Note 14 for additional segment information.

recording Syltone and Nash Elmo inventory at fair value.
In August 2003, the Company paid $24 million to acquire certain assets and
assume certain liabilities of a small machine shop operation in Odessa,
Texas. This operation services and repairs well stimulation and drilling
pumps serving the Permian Basin and thus, its financial results were
included in the Fluid Transfer Products segment from the date of
acquisition. There are no additional contingent payments or commitments
related to this acquisition. The amounts assigned to goodwill and other
intangible assets were inconsequential.
All acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase method and,
accordingly, their results are included in the Company consolidated
financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition. Under the
purchase method, the purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of
assets received and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.

-  During 2004, 2003 and 2002, reductions in inventory quantities net of
acquisitions resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers carried at
lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect was to increase net income
in 2004, 2003 and 2002 by $94, $249 and $268, respectively. It is the
Company policy to record the earnings effect of LIFO inventory
liquidations in the quarter which a decrease for the entire year becomes
certain. In each of the years 2002 through 2004, the LIFO liquidation income
was recorded in the fourth quarter. The Company believes that FIFO costs in
the aggregate approximates replacement or current cost and thus the excess
of replacement or current cost over LIFO value was $48 million and $45
million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company has adopted SFAS No. 142. This statement
required, among other things, the discontinuation of goodwill amortization,
assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and completion of a transitional
goodwill impairment test. Substantially all goodwill was assigned to the
reporting unit that acquired the business. Under the impairment test, if a
reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value, a
goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit
carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill.
The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using discounted cash
flows and market multiples. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company
completed its annual impairment test and determined that no impairment
existed.
30
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each business
segment for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows                                       Fluid

31 1 This amount consists of three loan agreements with similar terms
assumed in the 2004 acquisition of Syltone. The loans are Euro
denominated and had an outstanding balance of euro8,046 at
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004 the rate on this debt was
29% and averaged 30% for the year ended December 31, 2004.
2 The loans under this facility may be denominated in U.S. dollars or
several foreign currencies. At December 31, 2004, the outstanding
balance consisted of U.S. dollar borrowings of $73,000 and Euro
borrowings of euro30,000. The interest rates under the facility
are based on prime, federal funds and/or LIBOR for the applicable
currency and were 42% and 40% as of December 31, 2004 for the
U.S. dollar and Euro loans, respectively. The rates averaged 36%
and 40% for the year ended December 31, 2004 for the U.S. dollar
and Euro loans, respectively.
3 The interest rate varies with prime, federal funds and/or LIBOR. As
of December 31, 2004, this rate was 41% and averaged 35% for the
year ended December 31, 2004.
4 This amount consists of two commercial bank loans assumed in the
2004 acquisition of Nash Elmo with an outstanding balance of
euro7,650 at December 31, 2004. The loans are secured by the
Company facility in Bad Neustadt, Germany and are net of
unamortized discount of euro270.
5 The interest rate varies with market rates for tax-exempt
industrial revenue bonds. As of December 31, 2004, this rate was
21% and averaged 13% for the year ended December 31, 2004.
6 This amount consists of two loan agreements with similar terms
assumed in the 2004 acquisition of Syltone. The loans are
denominated in British pounds and had an outstanding balance of
pound3,133 at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004 the rate on
this debt was 31% and averaged 31% for the year ended December 31,
2004. On January 20, 1998, the Company entered into a Revolving Line of Credit
Agreement the Credit Agreement with an aggregate $125,000 borrowing
capacity and terminated a previous agreement. On March 6, 2002, the Company
amended and restated its Credit Agreement, increasing the aggregate
borrowing capacity to $150,000 and extending the maturity date to March 6,
2005. On September 1, 2004, the Company amended and restated the Credit
Agreement once again, increasing the borrowing capacity to $375,000. This
latter amended and restated Credit Agreement provided the Company with
access to senior secured credit facilities including a $150,000 five-year
Term Loan and a $225,000 five-year Revolving Line of Credit the Credit
Line. Proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to fund the Nash Elmo
acquisition and retire debt outstanding under its previously existing Credit
Line and Term Loan.
The Credit Line has a borrowing capacity of $225,000 and the total debt
balance is due upon final maturity on September 1, 2009. On December 31,
2004, the Credit Line had an outstanding principal balance of $113,635,
leaving $111,365 available for letters of credit or future use, subject to
the terms of the Credit Line.
The $150,000 Term Loan has a final maturity of September 1, 2009. The Term
Loan requires principal payments totaling $7,500, $15,000, $22,500, $37,500
and $67,500 in years one through five, respectively. Other terms and
conditions of the Term Loan are similar to those of the Credit Line.
In September 1996, the Company obtained fixed rate financing by entering
into an unsecured senior note agreement for $35,000. This note has a
ten-year final, seven-year average maturity, with principal payments that
began in 2000.
On April 23, 1998, the Fayette County Development Authority issued $9,500 in
industrial revenue bonds, on behalf of the Company, to finance the cost of
constructing and equipping a new manufacturing facility in Peachtree City,
Georgia. On July 2, 2001, the Company prepaid $1,500 of principal from
unused funds. The remaining principal for these industrial revenue bonds is
to be repaid in full on March 1, 2018. These industrial revenue bonds are
secured by an $8,100 letter of credit.
The Company borrowing arrangements permit certain investments and dividend
payments and are generally unsecured with the exception of the Credit
Agreement, which requires the pledge of the stock of certain wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and a security interest in the Company manufacturing
facility in Bad Neustadt, Germany. There are no material restrictions on the
Company as a result of its credit arrangements, other than customary
covenants regarding certain earnings, liquidity and capital ratios.
Debt maturities for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2004 and
thereafter, are $32,949, $26,022, $28,068, $45,618, $164,878 and $16,036,
respectively.
Cash paid for interest in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $7,817, $4,498 and $6,263,
respectively.
The rentals for all operating leases were $7,814, $3,818, and $3,357 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Future minimum rental payments for
operating leases for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2004 and
thereafter are $9,608, $7,252, $5,409, $4,305, $2,000 and $9,659,
respectively.
NOTE 8: PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company sponsors retirement plans covering substantially all worldwide
employees. Benefits are provided to employees under defined benefit
pay-related and service-related plans, which are generally noncontributory
in the U.S. and Germany and are generally contributory in the U.K. Annual
Company contributions to U.S. retirement plans equal or exceed the minimum
funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
The retirement plans covering the employees of the Company operation in
Schopfheim, Germany are unfunded and the full amount of the pension benefit
obligation is included as an accrued benefit liability on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
32 With regard to the 2001 Belliss & Morcom acquisition, the majority of the
employees are based in the U.K. and are provided retirement benefits under a
contributory defined benefit pay and service-related plan. Under the
Company purchase agreement, these employees were allowed to continue to
participate in the seller benefit plan for a period of up to one year from
the acquisition date. Within this one-year timeframe, the Company
established a similar retirement plan arrangement allowing employees the
option of transferring their accumulated benefit. The purchase agreement
also required the transfer from the seller plan of plan assets in excess
of the transferred accumulated benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2002,
the Company had not received this transfer and thus an estimate of this
receivable was included in the reconciliation of fair value of plan assets
table presented below. During 2003, the Company settled this receivable
resulting in adjustments to the benefit obligation and fair value of plan
assets for non-U.S. pension plans. These adjustments are included on the
acquisitions line in the reconciliation table below. Participation in this
plan was frozen as of January 1, 2004. Employees hired after that date
participate in a contributory defined contribution plan.
With regard to the 2004 Syltone acquisition, the majority of the employees
are based in the U.K. and Germany. In the U.K., the majority of these
employees are provided benefits under a contributory defined benefit pay and
service-related plan. Participation in this plan was frozen as of July 1,
2003. Employees hired after that date participate in a contributory defined
contribution plan. In Germany, with regard to employees of the Syltone
acquisition, employees are provided benefits under either a non-contributory
defined benefit pay and service-related plan or under a contributory defined
contribution plan.
With regard to the Nash Elmo 2004 acquisition, the majority of the employees
are based in the U.S. and Germany. In the U.S., employees are provided
benefits under both a non-contributory defined contribution plan and under
another defined contribution plan with no Company contributions. In Germany,
certain employees are covered by a non-contributory defined benefit pay and
service related plan. Employees hired after October 2000, are covered by a
non-contributory defined contribution plan.
Due to the significant declines in the financial markets, the fair value of
the plan assets of certain of the Company funded defined benefit pension
plans was less than their accumulated benefit obligation at December 31,
2002. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash charge to stockholders'
equity accumulated other comprehensive loss in the amount of $85 million
net of income taxes of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. During
2003, the financial markets and the assets of the Company funded benefit
pension plans experienced significant gains. As a result, the Company
recorded a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income of $33 million
net of income taxes of $17 million to reduce its additional minimum
pension liability. During 2004, the Company recorded an additional
non-cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income of $04 million
net of income taxes of $01 million to increase the additional minimum
pension liability.
The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans. Benefits are
determined and funded annually based on terms of the plans or as stipulated
in a collective bargaining agreement. Certain of the Company full-time
salaried and nonunion hourly employees in the U.S. are eligible to
participate in Company-sponsored defined contribution savings plans, which
are qualified plans under the requirements of Section 401k of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company matching contributions to the savings plans are
in the form of the Company common stock.
The full-time salaried and hourly employees of the Company operations in
Finland have pension benefits, which are guaranteed by the Finnish
government. Although the plans are similar to defined benefit plans, the
guarantee feature of the government causes the substance of the plans to be
defined contribution. Therefore, the discounted future liability of these
plans is not included in the liability for defined benefit plans, but the
expense for the Company contribution is included in the pension benefit
cost for defined contribution plans.
Certain salaried employees in the U.S. who retired prior to 1989, as well as
certain other employees who were near retirement and elected to receive
certain benefits and certain Nash Elmo employees, have retiree medical,
prescription and life insurance benefits. In most cases, the Nash Elmo
retirees pay the entire cost of their coverage. No other active salaried
employees have postretirement medical benefits. The hourly employees have
separate plans with varying benefit formulas. In all cases, however, no
currently active hourly employee, except for certain employees who are near
retirement, will receive healthcare benefits after retirement. All of the
Company postretirement medical plans are unfunded.
33 The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in both the
pension and other postretirement plans benefit obligations and fair value of
assets over the two-year period ended December 31, 2004, and a statement of

2 Applies only to pension plans For measurement purposes, the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered healthcare benefits assumed for 2004 was 84% for all
participants. The rates were assumed to decrease gradually each year to a
rate of 50% for 2010 and remain at that level thereafter.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the postretirement medical plans. A one-percentage point change
in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects                                          One-Percentage Point

secure participant retirement benefits and to minimize reliance on
contributions as a source of benefit security. Plan assets are invested
consistent with the provisions of prudence and diversification rules of
ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The expected return on plan
assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment return of the
plans since inception and evaluating those returns in relation to
expectations of various investment organizations to determine whether
long-term future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past.

through 2014. In 2005, the Company expects to contribute $2,436 to U.S.
pension plans and $5,050 to non-U.S. pension plans.

As of December 31, 2004, Gardner Denver has net operating loss carry-
forwards from various jurisdictions of $247 million that result in a
deferred tax asset of $71 million. It is more likely than not that a
portion of these tax loss carry-forwards will not produce future benefits
and a valuation allowance of $47 million has been established with respect
to these losses. The expected expiration dates of the tax loss carryforwards
are as follows; < 5 years, $56 million, 5 to 10 years, $0, 10 to 20 years 46 million and $145 million have no expiration date. The reversal of the
valuation allowance will reduce goodwill. In addition, the Company has a
U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward of $09 million that expires in 5 to 10
years.
U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on certain undistributed
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries approximately $54 million at December 31,
2004 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or
distribute them only when available foreign tax credits could significantly
reduce the amount of U.S. taxes due on such distributions.
During the year, the Company recorded an income tax benefit related to
favorable audit settlements in Finland and the U.S. of $14 million and $02
million, respectively.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act the AJCA was signed
into law. The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings
that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to apply
this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations made either after the
date of enactment in calendar year 2004 or throughout calendar year 2005.
During calendar 2004, the Company did not repatriate any qualified earnings
pursuant to the AJCA. However, the Company determined that approximately
$166 million of existing foreign earnings will meet the requirements of the
AJCA. The Company has determined that it will repatriate these earnings
during calendar 2005, as soon as the AJCA qualifying requirements are met.
Since these earnings are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested, the
Company accrued $09 million of income tax expense in 2004. In addition, the
Company is evaluating the potential to repatriate other foreign earnings
pursuant to the AJCA. Whether the Company repatriates their foreign earnings
is dependent upon the Company ability to meet the requirements of the AJCA
with respect to these earnings. Until that determination is made, the
Company will make no change in its current intention to indefinitely
reinvest accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except with
respect to the $166 million noted above. The range of additional amounts
that the Company is considering for repatriation under the AJCA is between
zero and $40 million. The related potential range of income tax is between
zero and $21 million.
Cash paid for income taxes in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $8,031, $5,220 and
$6,512, respectively.
NOTE 11: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Under the Company Long-Term Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan,
designated employees are eligible to receive awards in the form of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants or performance
shares, as determined by the Management Development and Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors. An aggregate of 4,250,000 shares of
common stock has been authorized for issuance under the Incentive Plan.
Through December 31, 2004, the Company has granted options on 3,622,909
shares. Under the Incentive Plan, the option exercise price equals the fair
market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Under the terms of
existing awards, one-third of employee options granted become vested and
exercisable on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.
The options granted to employees in 2002 and 2003 expire ten years after the
date of grant. The options granted to employees in 2004 expire seven years
after the date of grant.
Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each nonemployee director was granted an
option to purchase 4,500 shares of common stock on the day after the 2004,
2003 and 2002 annual meeting of stockholders. These options were granted at
the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant, become
exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant or upon
retirement, death or cessation of service due to disability, if earlier and
expire five years after the date of grant.
The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan the Stock Purchase
Plan, a qualified plan under the requirements of Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code, and has reserved 1,150,000 shares for issuance under
this plan. The Stock Purchase Plan requires participants to have the
purchase price of their options withheld from their pay over a one-year
period. In November 2000, the Stock Purchase Plan was amended to permit
eligible employees to purchase shares at the lesser of 85% of the fair
market price of the common stock on either the offering date or the exercise
date. The exercise date for the 2000 offering was January 2, 2002, at which
time employees elected to purchase 68,323 shares at an offering price of
$1536 per share, 85% of the fair market price on the offering date.
In November 2001, the Stock Purchase Plan was offered to eligible employees
under the same provisions as the 2000 offering. The exercise date for the
2001 offering was January 2, 2003, at which time employees elected to
purchase 46,460 shares at an offering price of $1708 per share, 85% of the
fair market price on the exercise date.
In November 2002, the Stock Purchase Plan was offered to eligible employees
under the same provisions as the 2001 offering. The exercise date for the
2002 offering was January 2, 2004, at which time employees elected to
purchase 94,965 shares at an offering price of $1272 per share, 85% of the
fair market price on the offering date.
In November 2003, the Stock Purchase Plan was offered to eligible employees
under the same provisions as the 2002 offering. The exercise date for the
2003 offering is January 3, 2005, at which time employees elected to
purchase 69,548 shares at an offering price of $1819 per share, 85% of the
fair market price on the offering date.
37 No additional options were offered to employees under the Stock Purchase
Plan in 2004.

-  The fair value of each option granted under the Incentive Plan and the Stock
Purchase Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were used
for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: risk-free interest rates of
31%, 24% and 30%; expected volatility of 34%, 35% and 35%; and expected
lives of 45, 38 and 33 years. The valuations assume no dividends are
paid. The weighted average fair values of options granted in 2004, 2003 and

NOTE 12: OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
There were no off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments as of
December 31, 2004 or 2003.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited
due to the wide variety of customers and industries to which the Company
products are sold, as well as their dispersion across many different
geographic areas. As a result, the Company does not consider itself to have
any significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2004.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist primarily of cash and
equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and debt instruments. The
book values of these instruments are not materially different from their
respective fair values.
The Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments to manage
interest costs and currency exchange risks. The Company does not hold
derivatives for trading purposes. No credit loss is anticipated, as the
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions with
high credit ratings. To effectively manage interest costs, the Company utilizes interest rate
swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt. Also as part of its hedging
strategy, the Company utilizes purchased option and forward exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the impact of currency
fluctuations on transactions, cash flows and firm commitments. These
contracts for the sale or purchase of European and other currencies
generally mature within one year.
38 Notional transaction amounts and fair values for the Company outstanding
derivatives, by risk category and instrument type, as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, are summarized as follows. Fair values of the derivatives do not
consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.                         2004          2003
Notional    Fair   Notional    Fair

Foreign currency forwards        $ 6,129    479     --     Interest rate swaps           $125,317    304      --       NOTE 13: CONTINGENCIES
The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, lawsuits and
administrative actions, which are of an ordinary or routine nature. In
addition, due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and
other primary defendants, the Company has been named as a defendant in an
increasing number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits. The Company has also
been named as a defendant in an increasing number of silicosis personal
injury lawsuits. The plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos
or silica from multiple sources and typically the Company is one of
approximately 25 or more named defendants. In the Company experience, the
vast majority of the plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease for which
the Company bears any responsibility.
Predecessors to the Company manufactured, distributed and sold products
allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits
the Products. The Company has potential responsibility for certain of
these Products, namely: a air compressors which used asbestos containing
components manufactured and supplied by third parties; and b portable air
compressors used in sandblasting operations as a component of sandblasting
equipment manufactured and sold by others. The sandblasting equipment is
alleged to have caused the silicosis disease plaintiffs claim in these
cases.
Neither the Company nor its predecessors ever mined, manufactured, mixed,
produced or distributed asbestos fiber. The asbestos-containing components
used in the Products were completely encapsulated in a protective
non-asbestos binder and enclosed within the subject Products. Furthermore,
the Company has never manufactured or distributed portable air compressors.
The Company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with
multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis
lawsuits. The Company also believes some of the potential liabilities
regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other
parties. The Company uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and
silicosis lawsuits have been immaterial.
The Company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis
lawsuits will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity, based
on: the Company anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to
address the risks of such matters; the limited potential asbestos exposure
from the components described above; the Company experience that the vast
majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to
alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the Products;
various potential defenses available to the Company with respect to such
matters; and the Company prior disposition of comparable matters. However,
due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments
could cause a different outcome, there can be no assurance that the
resolution of pending or future lawsuits, whether by judgment, settlement or
dismissal, will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
The Company has also been identified as a potentially responsible party with
respect to several sites designated for environmental cleanup under various
state and federal laws. The Company does not own any of these sites. The
Company does not believe that the future potential costs related to these
sites will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.
NOTE 14: SEGMENT INFORMATION
Subsequent to the acquisition of Nash Elmo and Syltone, the Company
continues to be organized based upon the products and services it offers and
has four operating divisions: Compressor, Blower, Liquid Ring Pump and Fluid
Transfer. These divisions comprise two reportable segments, Compressor and
Vacuum Products formerly Compressed Air Products and Fluid Transfer
Products. The Compressor, Blower which now includes the Syltone
transportation-related activities and Nash Elmo side channel blower
business and Liquid Ring Pump consisting of Nash Elmo liquid ring pump
business Divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment Compressor
and Vacuum Products since the long-term financial performance of these
businesses are affected by similar economic conditions, coupled with the
similar nature of their products, manufacturing processes and other business
characteristics. During the third quarter of 2004, the Company former Pump
and Fluid Transfer which consisted of the Syltone fluid transfer-related
activities Divisions were combined into one division, Fluid Transfer. These
two divisions were previously aggregated into one reportable segment Fluid
Transfer Products primarily due to the same factors as noted above, and
thus, there has been no change to the Fluid Transfer Products segment.
39 In the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment, the Company designs,
manufactures, markets and services the following products and related
aftermarket parts for industrial and commercial applications: rotary screw,
reciprocating, sliding vane and centrifugal air compressors; positive
displacement, centrifugal and side channel blowers; and liquid ring pumps
and engineered systems. The markets served are primarily in the United
States, Europe and Asia.
The Fluid Transfer Products segment designs, manufactures, markets and
services a diverse group of pumps, water jetting systems and related
aftermarket products used in oil and natural gas production, well servicing
and drilling and industrial cleaning and maintenance. This segment also
designs, manufactures, markets and services other fluid transfer components
and equipment for the chemical, petroleum and food industries. The markets
served are primarily the United States, Europe, Canada and Asia.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
Note 1. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on
income before interest expense, other income, net and income taxes. Certain
assets attributable to corporate activity are not allocated to the segments.
General corporate assets unallocated assets consist of cash and
equivalents and deferred tax assets. Intersegment sales and transfers are
not significant.

NOTE 16: SUBSEQUENT EVENT UNAUDITED
On March 8, 2005, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Thomas Industries Inc. Thomas, a New York Stock Exchange listed company
trading under the ticker symbol TII. Thomas is a worldwide leader in the
design, manufacture and marketing of precision engineered pumps, compressors
and blowers. The agreed-upon purchase price is $4000 per share for all
outstanding shares and share equivalents approximately $734 million and
the assumption of $95 million of long-term capitalized lease obligations.
As of December 31, 2004, Thomas had $267 million in cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments. The net transaction value, including assumed
debt and net of cash, is approximately $476 million.
Thomas is a leading supplier of pumps, compressors and blowers to the
original equipment manufacturer OEM market in such applications as medical
equipment, gasoline vapor and refrigerant recovery, automotive and
transportation applications, printing, packaging, tape drives and laboratory
equipment. Thomas designs, manufacturers, markets, sells and services these
products through worldwide operations with regional headquarters as
follows: North American Group - Sheboygan, Wisconsin; European Group -
Puchheim, Germany; and Asia Pacific Group - Hong Kong, China.
Thomas has wholly-owned operations in 21 countries on five continents. Its
primary manufacturing facilities are located in Sheboygan, Wisconsin,
Monroe, Louisiana, Skokie, Illinois and Syracuse, New York; Schopfheim,
Fahrnau, Puchheim and Memmingen, Germany; and Wuxi, China. The manufacturing
operations in the United States produce rotary vane, linear, piston and
diaphragm pumps and compressors, and various liquid pump technologies. These
products are directly sold worldwide to OEM, as well as through fluid
power and industrial distributors. The German operations manufacture a
complementary line of rotary vane, linear, diaphragm, gear, side channel,
radial, claw, screw and rotary lobe pumps, compressors and blowers, as well
as various liquid pump technologies, air-centers and centralized systems.
These products are also distributed worldwide. The manufacturing facility in
China was constructed during late 2004 and will begin production in mid
2005.
Thomas' largest markets are Europe and the United States, which represent
approximately 52% and 38% of its revenues, respectively. Of the total sales
to Europe, approximately 61% are to Germany and 39% to other European
countries. Approximately 10% of Thomas' revenues are generated in Asia
Pacific. At December 31, 2004, Thomas employed approximately 2,200 people.
For the year ended December 31, 2004, Thomas' revenues and operating income
were $410 million and $209 million, respectively. Operating income for this
period included $19 million from Thomas' 32% interest in the Genlyte Thomas
Group LLC GTG, a joint venture formed with The Genlyte Group Incorporated
Genlyte in 1998, and a $160 million nonrecurring gain on the sale of this
joint venture in July 2004. For the twelve-month period of 2004, operating
income from Thomas' Pumps and Compressors segment, net of corporate
expenses, was $30 million.
Gardner Denver has received a debt commitment to fully finance the
acquisition of Thomas. However, Gardner Denver intends to finance the
acquisition through an amended and expanded senior secured bank facility and
a public offering of approximately $200 million of its common stock. In
addition, the Company may choose to access the debt capital markets. The
acquisition is not conditioned upon completion of any of these financings
and the size and timing of the equity and any debt financings are subject to
prevailing market conditions.
The acquisition is expected to close in 2005 and is subject to the approval
of Thomas' stockholders and other customary closing conditions, including
the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals.
