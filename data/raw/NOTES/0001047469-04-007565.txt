Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants    
To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Sealed Air Corporation: 
We
have audited the consolidated financial statements of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
statements, we also have audited the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sealed Air Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2003, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
As
discussed in Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, as of January1, 2002.

SEALED AIR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      Amounts in tables in millions of dollars, except share and per share data    
Note1 General 
Sealed Air Corporation the Company, operating through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells a wide range of food, protective and specialty packaging products. 
The
Company conducts substantially all of its business through two direct wholly-owned subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US. These two subsidiaries directly and
indirectly own substantially all of the assets of the business and conduct operations themselves and through subsidiaries around the globe. The Company adopted this corporate structure in connection
with the Cryovac transaction. See Note18 for a description of the Cryovac transaction and related terms used in these notes. 
Note2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has eliminated all significant intercompany transactions and
balances in consolidation. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue
and expenses during the period reported. These estimates include assessing the collectibility of accounts receivable, the use and recoverability of inventory, the realization of deferred tax assets,
useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets and accruals for commitments and contingencies, among others. The Company reviews estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects
the effects of revisions in the consolidated financial statements in the period it determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling goods, and the Company considers revenues to be earned when the Company has completed the
process by which it is entitled to receive revenue. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is
fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company policy is to invest cash in excess of
short-term operating and debt service requirements in cash equivalents. These instruments are stated at cost, which approximates market value because of the short maturity of the
instruments. 
45  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Additional allowances may be
required if the financial condition of the Company customers deteriorates. 
Commitments and ContingenciesLitigation 
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the Company. While it is typically very difficult to
determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, the Company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final
adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, the Company makes estimates of the amount of insurance
recoveries, if any. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual
outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the Company has
previously made. 
Self-Insurance  The Company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property, casualty, workers' compensation and employee benefit claims. The Company accrues for
outstanding reported claims, claims that have been incurred but not reported and projected claims based upon management
estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience, insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values. Although management believes it has the
ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments, it is possible that actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities. 
Pensions 
Although the Company maintains a non-contributory profit sharing and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most U.S. employees of the Company
are eligible to participate, the Company also maintains defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its U.S. and for many of its non-U.S. employees. The Company accounts for
these pension plans in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions. Under these accounting standards, the Company makes
assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future
rate of return on plan assets, the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions. Changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and
liabilities recorded under SFAS No87. 
Financial Instruments 
The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments. The Company may use cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock
agreements and foreign 
46  exchange
forward contracts and options relating to the Company borrowing and trade activities. The Company may use these financial instruments from time to time to manage its exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company faces credit
risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations. However, the Company seeks to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with counterparties that are
major financial institutions with high credit ratings. 
Effective
January1, 2001, the Company accounts for derivative transitions in accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by
SFAS No137 and SFAS No138, referred to collectively as SFAS No133, which requires that the Company report all derivative instruments on its balance sheet at fair value and
establish criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Prior to entering into any derivative
transaction, the Company identifies the specific financial risk it faces, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce the risk and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging
instrument. The Company uses purchase orders and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged. The Company does not enter into derivative
transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk. The Company regularly reviews its hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging
instruments. 
The
Company accounts for derivative instruments as hedges of the related underlying risks if the Company designates these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective
as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions. 
The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions
are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations, at which time the Company recognizes the gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company recognizes gains and
losses on qualifying fair value hedges and the related loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the consolidated statement of operations. The
Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying forecasted transaction
is no longer probable of occurring. 
Accounts Receivable Securitization 
The Company two primary U.S. operating subsidiaries are party to an accounts receivable securitization program under which they can sell eligible U.S. accounts receivable to
an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into this program. The wholly-owned subsidiary in turn sells an undivided ownership interest in
these receivables to a bank or an issuer of commercial paper administered by that bank. The wholly-owned subsidiary retains the receivables it purchases from the two operating subsidiaries, except
those as to which it sells interests to the bank or to the issuer of commercial paper. The Company removes the transferred 
47  undivided
ownership interest amounts from its consolidated balance sheets at that time and reflects the proceeds from the sale in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statement of
cash flows. The Company reflects retained receivables in notes and accounts receivable on its consolidated balance sheets, and the carrying amounts thereof approximate fair value because of the
relatively short-term nature of the receivables. The Company reflects costs associated with the sale of receivables in other income expense, net, in the Company consolidated statements
of operations. 
Inventories 
The Company determines the cost of most U.S. inventories on a last-in, first-out or LIFO cost flow basis. The cost of U.S. equipment inventories and
most non-U.S. inventories are determined on a first-in, first-out or FIFO cost flow basis. The Company states inventories at the lower of cost or market. 
Property and Equipment 
The Company states property and equipment at cost, except for property and equipment that have been impaired, for which the Company reduces the carrying amount to the estimated
fair value at the impairment date. The Company capitalizes significant improvements; the Company charges repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expense as
incurred. The Company removes the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognizes any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition of the
assets. 
The
Company depreciates the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows: buildings 20 to 40years;
machinery and other property and equipment 3 to 20years. Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair value. The
Company reflects identifiable intangible assets in other assets at cost. These assets consist primarily of patents, licenses, trademarks and non-compete agreements. The Company amortizes
them over the shorter of their legal lives or their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, generally ranging from 3 to 20years. Identifiable intangibles, other than
goodwill, individually and in the aggregate, comprise less than 5% of the Company consolidated assets and therefore are immaterial to the Company consolidated balance sheets. In
July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS
No141 requires that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business combinations
completed after June30, 2001. SFAS No142 requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead test for impairment on a
reporting unit basis at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. A company may initiate a review of goodwill prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill 
48  may
be impaired. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segmentthe component
leveldiscrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic
characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit. A company must use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. A company
must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for the Company as a whole
and for each of the Company reporting units using various methods, such as discounted cash flows, equity market capitalization and comparative market multiples. The Company performs this annual test
for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year. This standard also requires that the Company amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives
to their estimated residual values and review these for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141 upon issuance and adopted SFAS No142 effective January1, 2002. The Company did not amortize any goodwill or any intangible
assets
determined to have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June30, 2001, but evaluated these for impairment. The Company amortized
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before July1, 2001 through the end of 2001. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company periodically reviews long-lived assets, other than goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairments when the expected future undiscounted cash flows derived from long-lived assets are less than their carrying
value. For these cases, the Company recognizes losses in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. The Company records assets to be disposed of by sale or
abandonment, where management has the current ability to remove these assets from operations, at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost of disposition. The Company suspends depreciation
for these assets during the disposal period, which is generally less than one year. Assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses, such as future cash flows and disposition
costs, may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets and possible impairment expense in the Company consolidated financial statements. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company follows the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure. As permitted by SFAS No123, the Company continues to follow the measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion or
APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. 
49  Contingent Stock Plan 
The
Company primary stock-based employee compensation program is a contingent stock plan. See Note15 for further information on this plan. The Company has adopted only the disclosure
provisions of SFAS No123 but applies APB No25 and related interpretations in accounting for the contingent stock plan. Since the compensation cost under this plan is consistent with
the compensation cost that
the Company would have recognized for such plan under the provisions of SFAS No123, the pro forma disclosure requirements under SFAS No123 are not applicable for this plan. Terminated Stock Option Plans 
The
Company terminated stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated prior to March31, 1998 as of that date in connection with the Cryovac
transaction see Note18, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of that date. All of these options had been granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value
on the date of grant. 
The
Company has adopted only the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123, but applies APB No25 and related interpretations in accounting for these stock options. All options outstanding
upon the termination of the stock option plans in 1998 had fully vested prior to December31, 2000; therefore, there is no pro forma effect on earnings and earnings per common share as a result
of applying SFAS No123 for years subsequent to 2000. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
In non-U.S. locations that are not considered highly inflationary, the Company translates the balance sheets at the end of period exchange rates with translation
adjustments accumulated in shareholders' equity. The Company translates statements of operations at the average exchange rates during the applicable period. The Company translates assets and
liabilities of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at the end of period exchange rates, except that it translates certain financial statement amounts at historical exchange
rates. The Company translates items reflected in statements of operations of its operations in countries with highly inflationary economies at average rates of exchange prevailing during the period,
except that it translates specified financial statement amounts at historical exchange rates. 
Income Taxes 
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries filea consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. The Company non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in
their respective local jurisdictions. The Company provides for income taxes on those portions of its foreign subsidiaries' accumulated earnings that it believes are not reinvested indefinitely in
their businesses. 
The
Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carryforwards. The Company determines deferred tax liabilities and
assets at the end of each period using enacted tax rates. 
50  The
Company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized
should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that
realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. 
In
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax
benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can
affect valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance,
which could materially affect the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Research and Development 
The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development costs were $690 million, $593 million and $558 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. 
Earnings Loss per Common Share 
The Company calculates basic earnings loss per common share by dividing net earnings loss ascribed to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period. Net earnings loss ascribed to common shareholders represents net earnings loss adjusted for gains losses attributable to the repurchase or redemption of preferred stock for an
amount below or above its book value, less preferred stock dividends. The computation of diluted earnings loss per common share is similar, except that the weighted average common shares outstanding
for the period are adjusted to reflect the potential issuance of dilutive shares, and the related change in net earnings loss ascribed to common shareholders that would occur is factored into the
calculation. 
Environmental Expenditures 
The Company expenses or capitalizes environmental expenditures that relate to ongoing business activities, as appropriate. The Company expenses expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations and which do not contribute to current or future net sales. The Company records liabilities when it determines that environmental assessments or
remediation expenditures are probable and that it can reasonably estimate the cost or a range of costs associated therewith. 
Note3 Business Segment Information 
The Company operates in two reportable business segments: iFood Packaging and iiProtective and Specialty Packaging. The Food Packaging segment comprises
primarily the Company Cryovac food packaging products. The Protective and Specialty Packaging segment includes the aggregation of the Company protective packaging products, engineered

Goodwill by Reportable Business Segment 
In accordance with SFAS No131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and because the Company management views goodwill as a corporate
asset, the Company has allocated all of its goodwill to the corporate level rather than to the individual segments. However, in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, the Company has allocated goodwill to each reportable segment in order to perform its annual impairment review of goodwill, which it does during the fourth quarter of each year. See
Note19 for a discussion of the annual goodwill impairment review. 
54  The
allocation of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142 for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 was as follows: Balance at

In December2001, the Company and a group of its U.S. subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial
paper administered by the bank. 
Under
this receivables facility, the Company two primary operating subsidiaries, Cryovac,Inc. and Sealed Air Corporation US, sell all of their eligible U.S. accounts receivable to Sealed
Air Funding Corporation, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility. Sealed Air Funding in turn may sell
undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper, subject to
specified conditions, up to a maximum of $1250million of receivables interests outstanding from time to time. 
Sealed
Air Funding retains the receivables it purchases from the operating subsidiaries, except those as to which it sells receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper. The
Company has structured the sales of accounts receivable by the operating subsidiaries to Sealed Air Funding, and the sales of receivables interests from Sealed Air Funding to the bank and the issuer
of commercial paper, as true sales under applicable laws. The assets of Sealed Air Funding are not available to pay any creditors of the Company or of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The Company
accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. 
To
secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank, as agent, in
accounts receivable owned by them, proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral. The bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse to the Company, the operating
subsidiaries' or Sealed Air Funding other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due. As long as a
termination event with 
55  respect
to the receivables facility has not occurred, the operating subsidiaries service, administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agents on behalf of Sealed Air
Funding, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper. Prior to a termination event under the receivables facility, Sealed Air Funding uses collections of receivables not otherwise required to be paid
to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper to purchase new eligible receivables from the operating subsidiaries. The Company has undertaken to cause the operating subsidiaries to perform their
obligations under the receivables facility. 
The
scheduled expiration date for the receivables facility is December7, 2004. The parties amended the receivables facility on April2, 2003 to provide that Sealed Air Funding could
sell receivables interests aggregating up to $600million, originated only by Sealed Air Corporation US, to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper until a definitive asbestos settlement
agreement, satisfactory to the bank, had been entered into. The receivables facility again became available for the sale of receivables interests originated by Cryovac,Inc. as well as Sealed
Air Corporation US, up to the original maximum of $1250million of receivables interests provided for by the receivables facility, on January26, 2004. The
parties also amended the receivables facility on April2, 2003 to exclude the charge for the asbestos litigation settlement reflected in the Company consolidated statement of operations
for the year ended December31, 2002 from the calculation of the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility. The Company must comply with these interest
coverage and leverage ratio covenants contained in the receivables facility in order to use the facility. The Company was in compliance with these ratios at December31, 2003. 
Under
limited circumstances, the bank and the issuer of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates. A downgrade of the Company long-term
senior unsecured debt to BB- or below by Standard Poor Rating Services or Ba3 or below by Moody Investors Service,Inc., or failure to comply with interest coverage and
debt leverage ratios could result in termination of the receivables facility. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related
costs, the Company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility. After reflecting this waiver, the Company was
in compliance with the requirements of the receivables facility as of December31, 2002. 
The
operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables facility during 2003, and therefore the Company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets
reflected on the Company consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2003. 
During
2002, Sealed Air Funding sold receivables interests to the issuer of commercial paper from time to time; however, as of December31, 2002, neither the bank nor the issuer of commercial
paper held any receivables interests and no related amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. 
The
receivables facility provides for the monthly payment of program fees which currently are 0375% per annum 045% per annum at December31, 2003 on the receivables interests sold by Sealed
Air Funding and commitment fees which currently are 0375% per annum 040% per annum at December31, 2003 on the unused portion of the $1250million receivables facility. 
56  The
costs associated with the receivables facility are reflected in other income expense, net, in the Company consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002 and 2001. These costs primarily relate to the loss on the sale of the receivables interests to the bank or the issuer of commercial paper, which were approximately zero for 2003 04million for 2002 and $01million for 2001, and program and commitment fees and other associated costs, which were approximately $06million, $04million and
$03million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
Note5 Acquisitions 
During the three-year period from 2001 to 2003, the Company made several acquisitions. The Company acquired these businesses for cash in the aggregate amount of
$25million, $105million and $360million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. These acquisitions
resulted in goodwill of $05million in 2003, $73million in 2002 and $167million in 2001. In each year, cash used for acquisitions was net of cash acquired in those
acquisitions. Cash acquired in acquisitions was not material in 2003, 2002 or 2001. The Company did not assume any debt in acquisitions in 2003 and 2002. In 2001, the Company assumed approximately
$190million of debt in acquisitions. These acquisitions were not material to the Company consolidated financial statements.

determined by that method amounted to $1373million and $1314million, respectively. If the Company had used first-in, first-out or FIFO inventory method, which
approximates replacement value, for these inventories, they would have been $226million and $172million higher at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

of $209million. The valuation allowance is related to the uncertainty of utilizing $395million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards, or $115million on a
tax-effected basis, and $336million of foreign investment tax allowances, or $94million on a tax-effected basis, that have no expiration period.

2001 Restructuring Program 
During
2001, based primarily on weakening economic conditions, especially in the U.S., the Company conducted a review of its business to reduce costs and expenses, simplify business processes and
organizational structure and refine further the Company manufacturing operations and product offerings. As a result of this review, which the Company completed in the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Company announced and began implementing a restructuring program that resulted in charges to operations of $328million for 2001. These charges consisted of the following: Year Ended
December 31, 2001 Employee termination costs 239 Facility exit costs 16 Long-lived asset impairments 73 Total 328 The
portion of this restructuring charge related to the Company food packaging segment was $211million, and the portion related to the protective and specialty packaging
segment was $117million. 
The
Company originally expected to incur $255million of cash outlays to carry out this restructuring program. These cash outlays primarily consisted of severance and other personnel-related
costs as well as lease and other contractual arrangement termination costs. As of December31, 2003, the Company had made total cash payments of approximately $229million
$53million in 2003, $118million in 2002 and $58million in 2001. In 2003 and 2002, the Company adjusted the 2001 cash restructuring accrual for net credits of
$05million and $13million respectively, as discussed below. After these cash outlays and the net credits, the restructuring accrual at December31, 2003 was
$08million, representing cash outlays expected to be made in 2004 and future years, primarily for severance-related 
60  costs.
The long-lived asset impairment of $73million consisted of the following write-downs and write-offs: Year Ended
December 31, 2001 Property, plant and equipment 39 Goodwill 33 Other long-lived assets 01 Total 73 These
long-lived asset impairments related to decisions to rationalize and realign production of some of the Company small product lines and to close several
manufacturing and warehouse facilities in North America, Europe, South Africa and the Asia Pacific region. The annual reduction of depreciation and amortization expense as a result of these asset
impairments was $04million. The Company has disposed of all of the above property, plant and equipment. 
During
2003 and 2002, the Company made adjustments to the original 2001 restructuring provision, resulting in a net credit to the consolidated statement of operations of $05million and
$13million, respectively. These adjustments resulted from the completion of actions for amounts different than expected, headcount reductions obtained through attrition, and, during 2002, the
revision of a plan to shut down one of the Company manufacturing facilities. The portion of the 2003 credit applicable to the Company food packaging segment was $03million, while the
portion applicable to the Company protective and specialty packaging segment was $02million. The portion of the 2002 net credit applicable to the Company food packaging segment amounted
to a credit of $29million, while the portion applicable to the protective and specialty packaging segment amounted to a charge of $16million. 
As
a result of the 2002 adjustments to the 2001 restructuring program, the Company expected a net reduction in headcount of approximately 440 positions. This program originally estimated a net
headcount reduction of approximately 470. The Company reduced the revised net headcount reduction by approximately 30 positions that were eliminated by attrition. This net reduction was based on the
elimination of 677 positions from all geographic areas in which the Company does business, primarily from its manufacturing, sales and marketing functions in North America and Europe. As of
December31, 2003, all of the 677 positions estimated to be eliminated under this program had been eliminated. The Company anticipated the addition of 237 positions in connection with its
realignment or relocation of manufacturing activities. 
61  The
components of the restructuring charges, spending and other activity through December31, 2003 and the remaining accrual balance at December31, 2003 were as follows: Employee

Profit-Sharing and Retirement Savings Plans 
The Company has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan covering most of its U.S. employees. Contributions to this plan, which are made at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, may be made in cash, shares of the Company common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of the Company common stock. The Company also maintains contributory thrift and
retirement savings plans in which most of its U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The contributory thrift and retirement savings plans generally provide for Company contributions based upon
the amount contributed to the plans by the participants. Company contributions to or provisions for its profit-sharing and retirement savings plans are charged to operations and amounted to
$269million, $362million and $261million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002 and 2001, there were no shares of common stock issued for the Company contribution
to its profit-sharing plan. The value of the 268,180 shares of common stock issued as part of the Company contribution to the profit-sharing plan in 2003 was $98million, with the
$171million balance of the 2003 contributions to these plans made in cash.

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually, taking into consideration the Company asset allocation, historical returns, and the current

The
Company long-term objectives for plan investments are to ensure that, athere is an adequate level of assets to support benefit obligations to participants over the life of
the plans, bthere is sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations, and cthere is a high level of investment return consistent with a prudent level of
investment risk. The investment strategy is focused on a long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term volatility less than that of a pure
equity strategy. To accomplish this objective, assets are invested in a balanced and diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. The target asset allocation will typically be
50-65% in equity securities, with a maximum equity allocation of 75%, and 35-50% in fixed income securities, with a minimum fixed income allocation of 25% including cash.

The Company generally does not offer its employees postretirement benefits other than certain programs which are required by the foreign countries in which the Company operates
and a U.S. program which is fully funded by the participating retired employees. Such programs are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Since
March31, 1998, the Company has offered to certain U.S. employees of the Cryovac packaging business a fixed subsidy applicable to participation in its U.S. postretirement healthcare
program. At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the accrued benefit liability associated with these subsidies amounted to $22million, $25million and $31million,
respectively. The net periodic postretirement expense and credit components, together with other remaining postretirement healthcare plan disclosures under SFAS No132, are not material to the
consolidated financial statements.

carrying value of the Euro Notes increased approximately $425million in 2003, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar during
2003.
2The
Company used the net proceeds of these offerings and additional cash on hand, an aggregate of $1,2981million, to redeem the outstanding shares of its SeriesA
convertible preferred stock. 
Revolving Credit Facilities: 
The 2006 Facility 
On December19, 2003, the Company entered into a new $3500million unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility that matures in 2006. The Company did not
borrow under the 2006 facility at its inception, and no borrowings were outstanding as of December31, 2003. 
The
2006 facility provides that the Company may borrow for working capital and general corporate purposes including payment of a portion of the $5125million cash payment required to be paid
upon 
67  the
effectiveness of an appropriate plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy see Note18 for further discussion. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the 2006
facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the 2006 facility. As of December31, 2003, facility fees were payable at the rate of 015% per annum on the total
amounts available under the 2006 facility. 
The
Company obligations under the 2006 facility bear interest at floating rates, which are generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the base rate or the interbank rate for
the relevant currency and time period. The 2006 facility provides for changes in borrowing margins based on the Company long-term senior unsecured debt ratings. 
The
2006 facility provides that, upon the occurrence of specified events that would adversely affect the settlement agreement in the Grace bankruptcy proceedings or would materially increase the
Company liability in respect of the Grace bankruptcy or the asbestos liability arising from the Cryovac transaction, the Company would be required to repay any amounts outstanding under the 2006
facility, or refinance the facility, within 60days. 
The 2003 Facility 
At December31, 2002, the Company principal revolving credit facility was a $5250million facility that the Company allowed to expire in accordance with its
terms on March30, 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2003 facility as of December31, 2002. 
The
2003 facility provided that the Company and specified subsidiaries could borrow for various purposes until the expiration or earlier termination of this facility. The Company could borrow to
refinance existing debt, provide working capital, make acquisitions, repurchases of the Company outstanding common and preferred stock and capital expenditures, and meet other general corporate
needs. Amounts repaid under the 2003 facility could be re-borrowed from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. As of December31, 2002,
facility fees were payable at the rate of 0095% per annum under the 2003 facility on the total amounts available under the credit facility. 
The
obligations under the 2003 facility bore interest at floating rates. The floating rates were generally determined by adding the applicable borrowing margin to the interbank rate for the relevant
currency and time period. 
Senior Notes Issued in July2003; Recapitalization: 
In July2003, the Company issued a total of $1,2813million of senior notes in transactions that were exempt from registration in reliance upon Rule144A
and other available exemptions under the Securities Act. On July18, 2003, the Company used the net proceeds from these offerings and additional cash on hand to redeem its SeriesA
convertible preferred stock at the redemption price of $5100 per share, for which the Company used $1,2981million of cash, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued from July1, 2003
through July17, 2003, for which the Company used $24million of cash. As discussed in Note15 below, the Company had previously repurchased an aggregate of 750,600 shares of its
SeriesA convertible preferred stock during 2003, prior to the July 18, 2003 redemption. As discussed below in this Note12, the Company subsequently used net cash of
$2082million to 
68  repurchase
an aggregate of $1725million of its senior notes and to terminate related interest rate swaps. 
The
senior note offerings consisted of the following: 4000million
aggregate principal amount of 5625% senior notes due July15, 2013. Accrued interest on the 5625% senior notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on January15 and July15 of each year, commencing on January15, 2004. The net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting the initial
purchasers' discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses, were $3956million. The carrying value of these notes at December31, 2003 was $3987million, net of
unamortized discount.
$4500million
aggregate principal amount of 6875% senior notes due July15, 2033. Accrued interest on the 6875% senior notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on January15 and July15 of each year, commencing on January15, 2004. The net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting the initial
purchasers' discount, unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses, were $4440million. The carrying value of these notes at December31, 2003 was $4484million, net of
unamortized discount.
$4313million
aggregate principal amount of 3% convertible senior notes due June30, 2033. Accrued interest on the 3% convertible senior notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on June30 and December30 of each year, commencing on December30, 2003. The net proceeds from this issuance, after deducting the initial
purchasers' discount and other offering expenses, were $4215million. The carrying value of these notes at December31, 2003 was $4313million. Holders
of the convertible senior notes may convert those notes into shares of the Company common stock at a conversion rate of 142857 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of $7000 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, before the close of business on June30, 2033. Holders may convert their convertible
senior notes only under the following circumstances: 1during any calendar quarter, if the closing sale price of the Company common stock exceeds 120% of the conversion price for at least
20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter; 2during any period in which ithe long-term credit
rating assigned to the notes by Standard Poor Rating Services, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, or Moody Investors Services,Inc. is lower than BB+ or Ba2,
respectively, iieither Standard Poor or Moody no longer rates the notes or has withdrawn or suspended this rating, or iiithe notes are not assigned a rating by both
Standard Poor and Moody; 3during the five business day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of
notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing sale price of the Company common stock and the conversion rate; 4if the notes have been called for
redemption; or 5upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. None of these circumstances that would allow for conversion of the notes has arisen at any time since their issuance. 
The
Company has the option to redeem the 3% convertible senior notes beginning July2, 2007 at a price equal to 101286% of their aggregate principal amount, declining ratably to 100% of their
aggregate principal amount on June30, 2010. 69  The
holders of the 3% convertible senior notes have the option to require the Company to repurchase the 3% convertible senior notes on June30 of 2010, 2013, 2018, 2023 and 2028, or upon the
occurrence of a fundamental change in or a termination of trading of the Company common stock, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
In
connection with the issuance of the 3% convertible senior notes, on September5, 2003 the Company filed a registration statement on FormS-3 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to register for resale the 6,160,708 shares of the Company common stock issuable, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, upon conversion of the notes. The registration
statement became effective on January23, 2004. 5375% Senior Notes: 
On April14, 2003, the Company issued $3000million aggregate principal amount of 5375% senior notes due April2008 in transactions exempt from
registration in reliance upon Rule144A and other available exemptions under the Securities Act. Accrued interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on
April15 and October15 of each year, commencing on October15, 2003. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes after deducting the initial purchasers' discount,
unamortized bond discount and other offering expenses were $2961million. 
The
carrying value of these notes at December31, 2003 was $2925million, net of unamortized discount and an adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes
of $61million due to changes in interest rates related to interest rate swaps the Company has entered into with respect to these notes. 
ANZ Facility: 
In March2002, the Company entered into an Australian dollar 1750million, which was equivalent to U.S. $1284million at December31, 2003,
dual-currency revolving credit facility that expires on March12, 2005, known as the ANZ facility. A syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the Company
Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes and the refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness. The Company may re-borrow amounts repaid under the ANZ
facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility. No amounts were outstanding under the ANZ facility at December31, 2003. 
Debt Repurchase: 
In December2003, the Company used net cash of $2082million to repurchase in the open market $1225million face amount of its 875% senior notes and
$500million face amount of its 695% senior notes and to terminate interest rate swaps on the 875% senior notes with a total notional amount of $1000million. The net cash used of
$2082million consisted of cash used to purchase the senior notes at a premium plus accrued interest and related fees of $2089million and cash received of $07million related
to the termination of the interest rate swaps. These repurchases were made at premiums to the face amounts of the notes and therefore resulted in a loss of $336million, which the Company
reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt repurchase. 
70  Covenants: 
Each issue of the Company outstanding senior notes and the Company outstanding Euro Notes imposes limitations on the Company operations and those of specified
subsidiaries. The principal limitations restrict liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The 2006 facility contains financial covenants relating to interest
coverage, debt leverage and minimum liquidity, and restrictions on the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, asset sales, and
amendments to the asbestos settlement agreement discussed above. The ANZ facility contains financial covenants relating to debt leverage, interest coverage and tangible net worth, and restrictions on
the creation of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and asset sales. The Company was in compliance with these limitations at December31, 2003. The 2003 facility had similar
covenants to those of the ANZ facility. In connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 for the asbestos settlement and related costs see Note18, the Company
requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the 2003 facility. After reflecting such waiver, the Company was in compliance with all
applicable requirements of each of the above instruments as of December31, 2002. 
Lines of Credit: 
Substantially all the Company short-term borrowings of $182million and $534million at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were
outstanding under lines of credit available to various of the Company U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Amounts available under these credit lines as of December31, 2003 and 2002 were
approximately $2153million and $2090million, respectively, of which approximately $1970million and $1550million, respectively, were unused. 
At
December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit, including the credit lines discussed above, of $6937million and
$8320million, respectively, of which $6754million and $7210million were unused. As of December31, 2003 and 2002, the total available lines of credit included
committed lines of credit of $4792million and $8320million, respectively, and uncommitted lines of credit of $2145million and $2100million, respectively. The
Company principal credit lines were all committed, and consisted of the 2006 facility at December31, 2003, the 2003 facility at December31, 2002 and the ANZ facility at both dates.
The Company is not subject to any material compensating balance requirements in connection with its lines of credit. 
71  Debt Maturities 
Scheduled annual maturities of long-term debt, exclusive of debt discounts, for the five years subsequent to December31, 2003 are as follows: 2004 24 2005 30 2006 2502 2007 16 2008 4784 Thereafter 1,5348 Total 2,2704 Note13 Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No133, as amended, which requires that the Company report all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at
fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No133 was not material to the
Company 2001 consolidated financial statements. 
The
Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, the Company enters
into various derivative instruments from time to time under its risk management policies. The Company designates derivative instruments as hedges on a transaction basis to support hedge accounting.
The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The Company assesses
the initial and ongoing effectiveness of its hedging relationships in accordance with its documented policy. The Company does not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes. 
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts 
The Company is exposed to market risk, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company subsidiaries have foreign currency exchange exposure from buying
and selling in currencies other than their functional currencies. The primary purpose of the Company foreign currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with
the amounts receivable or payable on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. At December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was party to foreign currency forward contracts, with aggregate
notional amounts of approximately $1619million maturing through April2004 and $1469million which matured through April2003, respectively. These contracts qualified
and were designated as cash flow hedges, and had original maturities of less than twelve months. Interest Rate Swaps 
From time to time, the Company may use interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. 
72  2003 Interest Rate Swaps:  At December31, 2003, the Company had interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $4000million that qualify and were designated as fair value hedges.
The Company entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of the 5375% senior notes and 875% senior notes into floating rate debt. At December31, 2003, the Company recorded the
following adjustments to long-term debt: an
adjustment to record a decrease in the fair value of the 5375% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $61million and an offsetting adjustment to other
liabilities to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps; and
an
adjustment to record an increase in the fair value of the 875% senior notes due to changes in interest rates of $38million and an offsetting adjustment to other
assets to record the fair value of the related interest rate swaps. The
Company also reduced interest expense $42million for the year ended December31, 2003, due to the impact of interest rate swaps that were outstanding during the year. 
In
connection with the Company repurchase of a portion of the 875% senior notes in December2003 see Note12, the Company terminated interest rate swaps with a total notional amount
of $1000million and received net cash proceeds of $07million.  2002 Interest Rate Swaps:  In June2002, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $500million that qualified and were designated as
fair value hedges in accordance with SFAS No133. The Company had entered into these agreements to, among other things, convert a portion of the 875% senior notes fixed rate debt into
floating rate debt. During September2002, the Company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the 875% senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately
$24million. The Company is amortizing this amount and reflecting it as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the 875% senior notes. The Company was not party to any
interest rate swap agreements at December31, 2002. 
U.S. Treasury Locks 
During the three months ended June30, 2003, the Company entered into U.S. Treasury lock agreements with a total notional amount of $7000million that qualified
and were designated as cash flow hedges. U.S. Treasury lock agreements are instruments used to manage the risks associated with movements in U.S. Treasury rates. The Company entered into these
agreements to manage interest rate risks arising from the planned issuance of the 5375% senior notes in April2003 and the planned issuance of the 5625% senior notes and the 6875% senior
notes in July2003 see Note12. The Company terminated these U.S. Treasury lock agreements prior to June30, 2003 and received net cash proceeds of $139million. The
Company has reflected this amount in other comprehensive income and is amortizing and reflecting it as a net reduction of interest expense over the lives of the respective senior notes. At
December31, 2003, the Company was not party to any U.S. Treasury lock agreements. 
The
Company may use other derivative instruments from time to time, such as options and collars to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange options to manage exposure to 
73  fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates, and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or
adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency. 
The
Company records gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income loss, to the extent that these hedges are effective and until it recognizes the
underlying transactions in earnings, at which time it recognizes these gains and losses in the
consolidated statement of operations. Other comprehensive income loss for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 reflected net unrealized after tax gains of $80 million $133 million
pre-tax and $01 million $02 million pre-tax, respectively, all of which the Company expects to be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations within the next
twelve months when the Company recognizes the underlying transactions in the consolidated statement of operations. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income loss will fluctuate based on
changes in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period. The Company practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or
terminated, or if the Company determines the underlying forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring. The Company cash flow hedges for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002
were effective within the meaning of SFAS No133, under which an effective hedge is one that qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. 
The
Company bears credit losses if the counterparties to its outstanding derivative contracts are unable to perform their obligations. However, it does not expect any counterparties to fail to perform
as they are major financial institutions with high credit ratings and financial strength. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the Company exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could
be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. 
Note14 Financial Instruments 
Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the Company must disclose its estimate of the fair value of material financial instruments,
including those recorded as assets or liabilities in its consolidated financial statements and derivative financial instruments. 
The
carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
The
fair value of the Company euro notes, senior notes and SeriesA convertible preferred stock are based on quoted market prices. The Company derived the fair value estimates of the
Company various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at
the balance sheet date. These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, the Company cannot determine them with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the Company estimates. 
The
fair value of the debt in the table below differs from the carrying amount due to changes in interest rates based on the market conditions as of December31, 2003 and 2002. Generally, the
fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The 
74 
carrying
value of the SeriesA convertible preferred stock as of December31, 2002 in the table below appears in the consolidated balance sheet at its mandatory redemption value of
$5000 per share. 
The
fair values of the Company various derivative instruments, which are based on current market rates, generally reflect the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
contracts at the reporting date. 
The
carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company financial instruments at December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2003

717,615 Contingent Stock Plan and Directors Stock Plan 
The Company contingent stock plan provides for the grant to employees of awards to purchase common stock during the succeeding 60-day period for less than 100%
of fair market value at the date of award. Shares issued under the contingent stock plan are restricted as to
disposition by the holders for a period of at least three years after award. In the event of termination of employment prior to lapse of the restriction, the shares of contingent stock are subject to
a repurchase option by the Company at the price at which the shares were issued. This restriction lapses prior to the expiration of the vesting period if specified events occur that affect the
existence or control of the Company. The Company credits the aggregate fair value of contingent stock issued to the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts and deducts the
unamortized portion of the compensation from shareholders' equity. The Company charges the excess of fair value over the award price of contingent stock to operations as compensation expense over a
three-year period. These charges amounted to $82million, $78million, and $100million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
Non-cash
compensation in 2003 and 2002 comprises shares issued to non-employee directors in the form of awards under the Company 2002 Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors, which stockholders of the Company approved at the 2002 annual meeting. The 2002 Directors Stock Plan provides for annual grants of shares to non-employee directors, and interim
grants of shares to eligible directors elected at times other than at an annual meeting, at a price per share equal to the par value of the shares, as all or part of the annual or interim retainer
fees for non-employee directors. During 2002, the Company adopted a plan that permits non-employee directors to elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer until the
non-employee director retires from the Board. The non-employee director can elect to defer the portion of the annual retainer payable in shares of stock. If a
non-employee director makes this election, the non-employee director may also elect to defer the portion, if any, of the annual 
76  retainer
payable in cash. The Company charges the excess of fair value over the price at which shares are issued under this plan to operations at the date of the grant. This charge amounted to
$03million in 2003 and $04million in 2002. 
In
2001, the Company made grants of shares to non-employee directors at a price of $100 per share under the then-effective Restricted Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors the 1998 Directors Stock Plan, which the Company terminated when the stockholders approved the 2002 Directors Stock Plan. The Company charged the excess of fair value over the price at
which shares were issued under this plan to operations at the date of the grant. These charges amounted to $04million in 2001. Shares issued under both plans are restricted as to disposition
by the holders as long as these holders remain directors of the Company. 
Amortization
expense related to the issuance of 60,000 and 50,000 shares in 2000 and 1999, respectively, of the Company common stock in exchange for non-employee consulting services was
$08million, $16million and $16million, in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These shares vest ratably over a three to five year period. The Company amortizes these shares
on a straight line basis. 
The
Company has adopted only the disclosure provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, but applies APB No25 and related interpretations in accounting for
these plans. Since the compensation cost noted above is consistent with the compensation cost that the Company would have recognized for these plans under the provisions of SFAS No123, the
pro forma disclosure requirements under this statement are not applicable for these plans.

On July18, 2003, the Company used cash of $1,2981million, including net proceeds of the Company July2003 senior notes offering of
$1,2784million, to redeem all the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at their redemption price of $5100 per share. The $5100 per share redemption price
included a $100 per share redemption premium, or $255million in the aggregate. The $255million paid for the redemption premium reduced shareholders' equity and net earnings ascribed
to common shareholders in 2003. 
Prior
to its redemption in 2003, the Company SeriesA convertible preferred stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and was convertible at any time into approximately 0885 of a share
of common stock for each share of preferred stock. The holders of these shares voted with the holders of the common stock on an as-converted basis and were entitled to receive cumulative
cash dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, at an annual rate of $200 per share, payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter. The
SeriesA convertible preferred stock ranked senior to the Company common stock and junior to the Company indebtedness. Because
it was subject to mandatory redemption, the Company classified the SeriesA convertible preferred stock outside of the shareholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. At
its date of issuance, the fair value of the SeriesA convertible preferred stock exceeded its mandatory 
78  redemption
amount primarily due to the common stock conversion feature. Accordingly, the Company reflected the book value of the SeriesA convertible preferred stock in the consolidated balance
sheet at its mandatory redemption value. 
During
2003, prior to its redemption, the Company repurchased 750,600 shares of the Company convertible preferred stock at a cost of $367million, representing a cost of $079million
below book value. During 2002, the Company repurchased 782,500 shares of the convertible preferred stock at a cost of approximately $288million, representing a cost of approximately
$103million below book value. The Company recorded this excess of book value over the purchase price of the preferred stock as an increase to additional
paid-in-capital.

Stock option plans in which specified employees of the Cryovac packaging business participated were terminated effective March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac
transaction, except with respect to options that remained outstanding as of this date. All of these options had been granted at an exercise price equal to their fair market value on the date of grant.
At December31, 2003, these options had per share exercise prices ranging from $2124 to $4219, a weighted-average remaining contractual life of approximately 26years, and terms
expiring up to March2007. 
During
2003, 2002 and 2001, the holders exercised options to purchase 125,277, 27,911 and 19,997 shares, respectively, with an aggregate exercise price of $47million, $09million and
$05million, respectively. At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the cumulative number of options to purchase 23,763, 23,763 and 15,590 shares of common stock, respectively, had expired.
At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, options to purchase 210,715, 335,992 and 371,178 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding at average per share exercise prices of $3946 3866 and $3828, respectively.

Basic earnings loss per common share were $221 for 2003, $420 for 2002 and $130 for 2001. Diluted earnings loss per common share were $200 for 2003, $430 for 2002
and $122 for 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization in 2001, basic earnings per common share would have been $199 and diluted earnings per common share would have been $189 in 2001. 
On
July18, 2003, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its SeriesA convertible preferred stock at a redemption price of $5100 per share. The Company also paid accrued
dividends on the preferred stock from July1, 2003 through July17, 2003 in the aggregate amount of $240million. The $5100 per share redemption price included a $100 per share
redemption premium, or an aggregate premium of $255million and is reflected in Basic earnings loss per common share in 2003. 
Gains
attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $08, $103 and $74million, respectively, and are reflected in basic earnings loss per common share for
these years. 
For
the purpose of calculating diluted earnings loss per common share for 2002 and 2001, the Company has adjusted net earnings ascribed to common shareholders to exclude the gains attributable to
the repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock and has adjusted the weighted average common shares outstanding to assume conversion of the
shares of preferred stock repurchased during these periods in accordance with the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-53 guidance. 
In
calculating diluted earnings per common share, the Company calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for 2003 assumes the issuance of ninemillion shares of common stock
reserved for the asbestos settlement as described in Note18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs, and the exercise of dilutive
stock options, net of assumed treasury stock repurchases. For 2002 and 2001, the calculation of weighted average number of common shares assumes the effect of the weighted average conversion of
repurchased shares of preferred stock. The Company has not assumed the conversion of the outstanding preferred stock in the calculation of diluted loss earnings per common share in 2002 and 2001,
because the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it was convertible would be anti-dilutive, meaning the issuance would reduce the loss per common share or increase earnings
per common share, in those years. The Company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the 2002 loss per common share calculation since the
effect would have been anti-dilutive.

Note18 Commitments and Contingencies 
Asbestos Settlement and Related Costs 
On November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees appointed to represent asbestos claimants in the bankruptcy case of W. R.
Grace Co., known as Grace, to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against the Company and its affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction described below.
The settlement will also resolve the fraudulent transfer claims, as well as indemnification claims by Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc. and affiliated companies, that had been made against
the Company in connection with the Cryovac transaction. On December3, 2002, the agreement in principle was approved by the Company Board of Directors. The Company received notice that both
of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. For a description of the Cryovac Transaction, asbestos-related claims and the parties involved, see Cryovac
Transaction and Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction below. 
The
Company recorded a charge of $8501million as a result of the asbestos settlement in its consolidated statement of operations as of December31, 2002. The charge consisted of the
following items: a
non-cash charge of $5125million covering a cash payment that the Company will be required under the settlement to make upon the effectiveness of a
plan of reorganization in the Grace bankruptcy. Because the Company cannot predict when a plan of reorganization may become effective, the Company recorded this liability as a current liability on the
consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. Under the terms of the settlement, this amount accrues interest at a 55% annual rate from December21, 2002 to the date of payment. The
Company has recorded this interest in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
a
non-cash charge of $3215million representing the fair market value at the date the Company recorded the charge of 9million shares of the
Company common stock expected to be issued under the settlement upon the effectiveness of Grace plan of reorganization. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions
that adjust for the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock. The fair market value of the Company common stock was $3572 per share as of the
close of business on December5, 2002. The Company recorded this amount in its consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002 as follows: $09million representing the aggregate
par value of these shares in common stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement, and the remaining $3206million, representing the excess of the aggregate fair market value
over the aggregate par value of these common shares in additional paid-in capital. The December31, 2003 diluted earnings per common share calculation reflects the shares of common
stock reserved for issuance related to the asbestos settlement.
$161million
of legal and related fees as of December31, 2002. Asbestos
settlement and related costs in 2003 reflected legal and related fees for asbestos-related matters of $28million. In 2001, asbestos settlement and related costs of
$120million included $81million related to the Company guarantee, resulting from the Cryovac transaction, of specified 
82  debt
payable by W. R. Grace Co. Conn., which filed for reorganization along with its parent company Grace, and $39million of legal and related fees. 
Cryovac Transaction 
On March31, 1998, the Company completed a multi-step transaction that brought the Cryovac packaging business and the former Sealed Air Corporation
business under the common ownership of the Company. These businesses operate as subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company acts as a holding company. As part of that transaction, the parties
separated the Cryovac packaging business, which previously had been held by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, from the remaining businesses previously held by the Company. The
parties then arranged for the contribution of these remaining businesses to a company now known as W. R. Grace Co., and the Company distributed the Grace shares to the Company stockholders.
As a result, W. R. Grace Co. became a separate publicly owned company. The Company recapitalized its outstanding shares of common stock into a new common stock and a new convertible preferred
stock. A subsidiary of the Company then merged into the former Sealed Air, which became a subsidiary of the Company and changed its name to Sealed Air Corporation US. 
Contingencies Related to the Cryovac Transaction 
In connection with the Cryovac transaction, Grace and its subsidiaries retained all liabilities arising out of their operations before the Cryovac transaction, whether accruing
or occurring before or after the Cryovac transaction, other than liabilities arising from or relating to Cryovac operations. Among the liabilities retained by Grace are liabilities relating to
asbestos-containing products previously manufactured or sold by Grace subsidiaries prior to the Cryovac transaction, including its primary U.S. operating subsidiary, W. R. Grace
Co.Conn., which has operated for decades and has been a subsidiary of Grace since the Cryovac transaction. The Cryovac transaction agreements provided that, should any
claimant seek to hold the Company or any of its subsidiaries responsible for liabilities retained by Grace or its subsidiaries, including the asbestos-related liabilities, Grace and its subsidiaries
would indemnify and defend the Company. 
Since
the beginning of 2000, the Company has been served with a number of lawsuits alleging that, as a result of the Cryovac transaction, the Company is responsible for alleged asbestos liabilities of
Grace and its subsidiaries, some of which were also named as co-defendants in some of these actions. Among these lawsuits are several purported class actions and a number of personal
injury lawsuits. Some plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury or wrongful death, while others seek medical monitoring, environmental remediation or remedies related to an attic insulation product.
Neither the former Sealed Air nor Cryovac ever produced or sold any of the asbestos-containing materials that are the subjects of these cases. None of these cases has reached resolution through
judgment, settlement or otherwise. As discussed below, Grace Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding has stayed all these cases. 
While
the allegations in these actions directed to the Company vary, these actions all appear to allege that the transfer of the Cryovac business as part of the Cryovac transaction was a fraudulent
transfer or gave rise to successor liability. Under a theory of successor liability, plaintiffs with claims against Grace and its subsidiaries may attempt to hold the Company liable for liabilities
that arose with respect to activities conducted prior to the Cryovac transaction by W. R. Grace Co.Conn. or other Grace 
83  subsidiaries.
A transfer would be a fraudulent transfer if the transferor received less than reasonably equivalent value and the transferor was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by the transfer, was
engaged or was about to engage in a business for which its assets constitute unreasonably small capital, or intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they
mature. A transfer may also be fraudulent if it was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. If a court found any transfers in connection with the Cryovac transaction to be
fraudulent transfers, the Company could be required to return the property or its value to the transferor or could be required to fund liabilities of Grace or its subsidiaries for the benefit of their
creditors, including asbestos claimants. The Company has reached an agreement in principle and subsequently signed a settlement agreement, described below, that will resolve all these claims.
Previously, the Company was unable to estimate the loss or range of loss in the event that there had been a finding that the Cryovac transaction was a fraudulent transfer or gave rise to successor
liability. 
In
the Joint Proxy Statement furnished to their respective stockholders in connection with the Cryovac transaction, both parties to the transaction stated that it was their belief that Grace and its
subsidiaries were adequately capitalized and would be adequately capitalized after the Cryovac transaction and that none of the transfers contemplated to occur in the Cryovac transaction would be a
fraudulent transfer. They also stated their belief that the Cryovac transaction complied with other relevant laws. However, if a court applying the relevant legal standards had reached conclusions
adverse to the Company, these determinations could have had a materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated results of operations and financial position. 
On
April2, 2001, Grace and a number of its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the District of
Delaware. Grace stated that the filing was made in response to a sharply increasing number of asbestos claims since 1999. In
connection with its Chapter 11 filing, Grace filed an application with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to stay, among others, all actions brought against the Company and specified subsidiaries related
to alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its subsidiaries or alleging fraudulent transfer claims. The court issued an order dated May3, 2001, which was modified on January22, 2002,
under which the court stayed all the filed or pending asbestos actions against the Company and, upon filing and service on the Company, all future asbestos actions. No further proceedings involving
the Company can occur in the actions that have been stayed except upon further order of the Bankruptcy Court. 
Committees
appointed to represent asbestos claimants in Grace bankruptcy case received the court permission to pursue fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company and its subsidiary
Cryovac,Inc., and against Fresenius, as discussed below. The claims against Fresenius are based upon a 1996 transaction between Fresenius and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. Fresenius is not affiliated with the Company. In March2002, the court ordered that the issues of the solvency of Grace following the Cryovac transaction
and whether Grace received reasonably equivalent value in the Cryovac transaction would be tried on behalf of all of Grace creditors. This proceeding is pending in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware Adv. No02-02210. 
In
June2002, the court permitted the U.S. government to intervene as a plaintiff in the fraudulent transfer proceeding, so that the U.S. government could pursue allegations that remediation
expenses 
84  were
underestimated or omitted in the solvency analyses of Grace conducted at the time of the Cryovac transaction. The court also permitted Grace, which asserted that the Cryovac transaction was not a
fraudulent transfer, to intervene in the proceeding. In July2002, the court issued an interim ruling on the legal standards to be applied in the trial, holding, among other things, that,
subject to specified limitations, post-1998 claims should be considered in the solvency analysis of Grace. The Company believes that only claims and liabilities that were known, or
reasonably should have been known, at the time of the 1998 Cryovac transaction should be considered under the applicable standard. On
September20, 2002, in an unrelated bankruptcy case, Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Cybergenics Corp. v. Chinery, 304 F3d 316
3d Cir. 2002, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that only a trustee in bankruptcy or a debtor-in-possession could prosecute a fraudulent transfer
action. Since the plaintiffs in the fraudulent transfer case against the Company were the Committees and not a trustee or debtor, and since the law of the Third Circuit is binding in the District of
Delaware, where the proceeding was pending, it was uncertain whether the Committees had authority under the law to prosecute the constructive fraudulent transfer case and, accordingly, the future
posture of the case was uncertain. In light of the Cybergenics decision, on September27, 2002, the court postponed the trial date, which had
originally been set for September30, 2002, and then on October24, 2002 issued an order rescheduling the trial to begin on December2, 2002 but granting the parties permission to
ask the Third Circuit to hear an immediate appeal of the order. On October31, 2002, the Company asked the Third Circuit for permission to appeal the order. Given these circumstances, the
Company did not know whether the Committees would be permitted to prosecute the fraudulent transfer and other claims against the Company or whether the Third Circuit might hold that some other party
perhaps the debtor-in-possession or a trustee might have to prosecute these claims if it so chose. In the Grace bankruptcy proceeding, the
debtor-in-possession had already taken the position that it did not believe that the 1998 transaction was a fraudulent transfer. On
November18, 2002, Judge Alfred M. Wolin, the judge hearing the Company case, advised the parties that the Cybergenics decision would be
reheard en banc, which had the effect of vacating the prior decision under Third Circuit rules. Judge Wolin also ordered the Company fraudulent
conveyance trial to commence on December9, 2002 and ordered the parties to appear for mediation on November27, 2002. 
On
November27, 2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the Committees prosecuting the claims against the Company and Cryovac,Inc., to resolve all current and future
asbestos-related claims arising from the Cryovac transaction. On the same day, the court entered an order confirming that the parties had reached an amicable resolution of the disputes among the
parties and that counsel for the Company and the Committees had agreed and bound the parties to the terms of the agreement in principle. As discussed above, the agreement in principle calls for
payment of 9million shares of Sealed Air common stock and $5125million in cash, plus interest on the cash payment at a 55% annual rate starting on December21, 2002 and ending
on the effective date of the Grace plan of reorganization, when the Company is required to make the payment. These shares are subject to customary anti-dilution provisions that adjust for
the effects of stock splits, stock dividends and other events affecting the Company common stock. On December3, 2002, the Company Board of Directors approved the agreement in principle.
The Company received notice that both of the Committees had approved the agreement in principle as of December5, 2002. The parties subsequently 
85  signed
a definitive settlement agreement as of November10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. On November26, 2003, the parties jointly presented the
definitive settlement agreement to the court for approval. After approval of the agreement, the agreement will eventually be incorporated into Grace plan of reorganization and, assuming approval by
Grace creditors as part of the approval of the plan of reorganization, will then be implemented. As
a condition to the Company obligation to make the payments required by the settlement, Grace plan of reorganization must be consistent with the terms of the settlement, including provisions for
the trusts and releases referred to below and for an injunction barring the prosecution of any asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates. In that case, the settlement will provide
that, upon the effective date of Grace plan of reorganization and payment of the shares and cash, all present and future asbestos-related claims against the Company and its affiliates that arise
from alleged asbestos liabilities of Grace and its affiliates including former affiliates that became affiliates of the Company through the Cryovac transaction will be channeled to and become the
responsibility of one or more trusts to be established under Section524g of the Bankruptcy Code as part of Grace plan of reorganization. The settlement will also resolve all fraudulent
transfer claims against the Company and its affiliates arising from the Cryovac transaction as well as the Fresenius claims described below. The settlement will provide that the Company and its
affiliates will receive releases of all those claims upon payment. Under the agreement, the Company cannot seek indemnity from Grace for the Company payments required by the settlement. The Company
expects that the order approving the settlement agreement will also provide that the stay of proceedings involving the Company described above will continue through the effective date of Grace plan
of reorganization, after which the Company will be released from the liabilities asserted in those proceedings and their continued prosecution against the Company will be enjoined. 
The
Company does not know when Grace plan of reorganization will be presented to the court for approval, nor does it know whether the plan of reorganization will be consistent with the terms of the
settlement or if the other conditions to the Company obligation to pay the settlement amount will be met. If these conditions are not satisfied or not waived by the Company, the Company will not be
obligated to pay the settlement amount. However, if the Company does not pay the settlement amount, the Company and its affiliates will not be released from the various asbestos-related, fraudulent
transfer, and indemnification claims made against them, and all of these claims would remain pending and would have to be resolved through other means, such as through agreement on alternative
settlement terms or trials. 
In
January2002, the Company filed a declaratory judgment action against Fresenius Medical Care Holdings,Inc., its parent, Fresenius AG, a German company, and specified affiliates in
New York State court asking the court to resolve a contract dispute between the parties. The Fresenius parties contended that the Company was obligated to indemnify them for liabilities that they
might incur as a result of the 1996 Fresenius transaction mentioned above. The Fresenius parties' contention was based on their interpretation of the agreements between them and W. R. Grace
Co.Conn. in connection with the 1996 Fresenius transaction. In February2002, the Fresenius parties announced that they had accrued a charge of
$1720million for these potential liabilities, which include pre-transaction tax liabilities of Grace and the costs of defense of litigation arising from Grace Chapter 11 filing.
The Company believed that it was not responsible to indemnify the Fresenius parties under the 1996 
86  agreements
and filed the action to proceed to a resolution of the Fresenius parties' claims. In April2002, the Fresenius parties filed a motion to dismiss the action and for entry of
declaratory relief in its favor. The Company opposed the motion, and in July2003, the court denied the motion without prejudice in view of the November27, 2002 agreement in principle
referred to above. As noted above, under the settlement agreement, there will be mutual releases exchanged between the Fresenius parties and the Company releasing any and all claims related to the
1996 Fresenius transaction. 
In
view of Grace Chapter 11 filing, the Company may receive additional claims asserting that the Company is liable for obligations that Grace had agreed to retain in the Cryovac transaction and for
which the Company may be contingently liable. To date, no material additional claims have been asserted or threatened against the Company. 
Final
determinations and accountings under the Cryovac transaction agreements with respect to matters pertaining to the transaction had not been completed at the time of Grace Chapter 11 filing in
2001. The Company has filed claims in the bankruptcy proceeding that reflect all of the costs and liabilities that it has incurred or may incur that Grace and its affiliates agreed to retain or that
are subject to indemnification by Grace and its affiliates under the Cryovac transaction agreements, other than payments to be made under the settlement agreement. Grace has alleged that the Company
is responsible for specified amounts under the Cryovac transaction agreements. Any amounts for which the Company may be liable to Grace may be used to offset the liabilities of Grace and its
affiliates to the Company. The Company intends to seek indemnification by Grace and its affiliates for defense costs related to asbestos and fraudulent transfer litigation and the Fresenius claims,
and approximately
$81million paid by the Company on account of its guaranty of debt issued by W. R. Grace Co. Conn. Except to the extent of any potential setoff or similar claim,
the Company expects that its claims will be as an unsecured creditor of Grace. Since portions of the Company claims against Grace and its affiliates are contingent or unliquidated, to the Company
cannot determine the amount of the Company claims, the extent to which these claims may be reduced by setoff, how much of the claims may be allowed, or the amount of the Company recovery on these
claims, if any, in the bankruptcy proceeding. 
On
September15, 2003, the case of Senn v. Hickey, et al. Case No03-CV-4372 was filed in the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey Newark. This lawsuit seeks class action status on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of the Company during the period from
March27, 2000 through July30, 2002. The lawsuit names the Company and specified current and former officers and directors of the Company as defendants. The Company is required to
provide indemnification to the other defendants, and accordingly the Company counsel is also defending them. The lawsuit makes a number of allegations against the defendants. The principal
allegations are that during the above period the defendants materially misled the investing public, artificially inflated the price of the Company common stock by publicly issuing false and
misleading statements and violated GAAP by failing to accrue for the Company contingent liability for asbestos claims arising from past operations of Grace. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages
and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, since the Company believes that it properly disclosed its contingent liability for Grace asbestos claims. Although the Company
currently believes that it should have no liability in this lawsuit, until the lawsuit has progressed beyond its current preliminary stage, the Company cannot estimate the potential cost of an
unfavorable outcome, if any. 
87  Leases 
The Company is obligated under the terms of various leases covering primarily warehouse and office facilities and production equipment, as well as smaller manufacturing sites
that it occupies. The Company accounts for substantially all of its leases as operating leases. Net rental expense was $270million, $243million and $232million for 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. Estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under noncancelable real and personal property leases are as follows:
2004$272million; 2005$215million; 2006$161million;
2007$133million; 2008$99million; and subsequent years$102million. 
Long-Term Commitments 
The Company has the following long-term commitments: Approximately
$189million for the purchase of equipment over a five-year period which began in 2003, together with a potential termination fee in an
amount to be determined. The Company obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the Packaging Machinery Manufacturers Index. Estimated future
minimum annual commitments are as follows: 2004$39million; 2005$45million;
2006$50million; and 2007$55million. Failure to purchase any of the minimum annual requirements in any year obligates the
Company to pay an amount of 45% of such shortfall. During 2003 the Company did not meet the minimum equipment purchase requirements and recorded a charge of $10million.
Approximately
$129million minimum commitment for the purchase of telecommunications and network capacity and services over a four-year period that began
in 2004.
Approximately
$84million to a supplier if the Company fails to purchase 1263million pounds of specified raw materials, at the then current market price,
over a ten-year period that began in May, 2002. The amount of the potential contingent payment declines in proportion to the Company purchase of minimum quantities required under the
contract. At December31, 2003, the Company purchases were in line with the minimum quantity requirements under the agreement.
Approximately
$60million to a supplier of raw materials under an agreement that provides that the Company commits to purchase a specified quantity of raw materials
at a fixed price through 2004. Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and it accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and
remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and
are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental
matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations, balance sheets or cash flows. Environmental liabilities are reassessed 
88  whenever
circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated. The Company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information,
including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of
costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated,
the Company adjusts the recorded accruals, as necessary. The Company believes that these exposures are not material to its consolidated results of operations and balance sheets. The Company believes
that it has adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures. 
Note19 New Accounting Pronouncements 
Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements 
In July2001, the FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141 requires
that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001 as well as all purchase method business
combinations completed after June30, 2001. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. This standard also required that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No141 upon issuance and adopted SFAS No142 effective January1, 2002. Any goodwill and any intangible assets determined to
have an indefinite useful life that were acquired in a purchase business combination completed after June30, 2001 were not amortized, but were evaluated for impairment. Goodwill and intangible
assets acquired in business combinations completed before July1, 2001 were amortized through the end of 2001. 
In
connection with the transitional impairment evaluation, SFAS No142 required the Company to assess whether goodwill and other intangible assets were impaired as of January1, 2002.
As required by this statement, the Company completed its assessment process on a reporting unit basis as of June30, 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as of
January1, 2002. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segmentthe component
leveldiscrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic
characteristics of the other components of the operating segments, in which case this component is the reporting unit. A company must use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. A
company must recognize an impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value. The Company derives an estimate of fair values for the Company as a
whole and for each of the Company reporting units by using discounted cash flows, equity market capitalization and comparative market multiples. As
of December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of $1,9395million and $1,9262million, respectively. Amortization expense related to
goodwill was 
89  570million
in 2001. Beginning January1, 2002, in accordance with SFAS No142, the Company stopped recording amortization expense related to goodwill. Although the Company no
longer systematically amortizes goodwill, this standard requires that the Company conduct periodic reviews to assess whether or not the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. These reviews could
result in future write-downs of goodwill which would be reflected as a charge against operating income. 
As
required by SFAS No142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have to be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No142. The Company completed its annual testing for impairment for 2003 and 2002 during the fourth quarters of each year and determined that no impairment charge was necessary on a reporting
unit basis in either period. 
As
of December31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had identifiable intangible assets with definite useful lives with a gross carrying value of $708million and $691million,
respectively, less accumulated amortization of $545million and $477million, respectively. These identifiable intangible assets therefore are immaterial to the Company consolidated
balance sheets. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets was approximately $61million for 2003. Assuming no change in the gross carrying value of identifiable intangible assets from the
value at December31, 2003, the estimated amortization for the year ended December31, 2003 and the next four succeeding years is approximately $61million per year. These assets
are reflected in other assets in the Company consolidated balance sheets. At December31, 2003 and 2002, there were no identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, with indefinite
useful lives as defined by SFAS No142.

The SAB updates
portions of the interpretive guidance included in Topic13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make the guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting
literature. The principal revisions relate to the incorporation of certain sections of the staff frequently asked questions document on revenue recognition into Topic13. The adoption of
SAB104 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
November2003, FASB Interpretation No. FIN 45, Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an
interpretation of FASB Statements No5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No34 was issued. This Interpretation enhances disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees. The Interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of the Interpretation were 
91  applicable
to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002, and the disclosure requirements were effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after
December15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
April2003, the FASB issued Statement No149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No149 is intended to result in more
consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to SFAS No133 in its entirety, or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded
derivative features. In addition, SFAS No149 clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on initial net investments related to derivatives. SFAS149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No149 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
On
January1, 2003, the Company adopted SFAS No143, Asset Retirement Obligations, which provides the accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible
long-lived assets. This statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. The adoption of SFAS
No143 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
January2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor, which states
that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor products or services and should, therefore, be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales
when recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. That presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred to
sell the vendor products or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor. EITF 02-16 is effective for arrangements entered into after December31, 2002. The adoption
of EITF 02-16 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, which provides alternative methods of
transition for companies that choose to switch to the fair value method of accounting for stock options. SFAS No148 also makes changes in the disclosure requirements for stock-based
compensation, regardless of which method of accounting is chosen. The Company had terminated all previously maintained stock option plans effective March31, 1998 in connection with the Cryovac
transaction, except with respect to options that were still outstanding as of that date. The adoption of SFAS No148 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements. 
In
April2002, FASB issued SFAS No145, Rescission of SFAS No4, 44 and 64, Amendment of SFAS No13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS145 amends existing
guidance on reporting gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt to prohibit the classification of the gain or loss as extraordinary, as the use of such extinguishments have become part of the
risk management strategy of many companies. SFAS No145 also amends SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases, to require sale-leaseback accounting for certain lease
modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions. The provisions of Statement 145 related to the rescission of SFAS No4, Reporting Gains and Losses
from 
92  Extinguishment
of Debt, were applied in fiscal years beginning after May15, 2002. The provisions of Statement 145 related to Statement 13 were effective for transactions occurring after
May15, 2002. In December2003, the Company used net cash of $2082million to repurchase, at a premium in the open market, $1225million face amount of its 875% senior
notes and $500million face amount of its 695% senior notes and terminate interest rate swaps on the 875% senior notes with a total notional amount of $1000million which resulted in
a loss of $336million, which the Company reflected in the statement of operations as Loss on debt repurchase in accordance with the provisions of SFAS145. 
In
June2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force or EITF Issue
No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring and requires
that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. Under EITF
94-3, a liability for an exit cost was required to be recognized at the date of an entity commitment to an exit plan. The adoption of SFAS No146 is expected to result in delayed
recognition for some types of costs as compared to the provisions of EITF 94-3. SFAS No146 is effective for new exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December31, 2002 and does not affect amounts currently reported in the Company consolidated financial statements. SFAS No146 will affect the types and timing of costs included in
future restructuring programs, if any. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No150 establishes standards
for how an issuer classifies and measures specified financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within
its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances. Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. SFAS No150 became effective for the Company on July1,
2003. The adoption of SFAS No150 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
In
December2003, FASB issued SFAS No132 revised, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. SFAS No132 revised prescribes employers'
disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans; it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans. SFAS No132 revised reforms and revises the
disclosure requirements contained in the original Statement. It also requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension
plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The statement generally is effective for U.S. plan disclosures for fiscal years ending after December15, 2003. Disclosures for
non-U.S. plans are not affected until fiscal years ending after December15, 2004. The Company disclosures in Note11 incorporate the changes prescribed by SFAS
No132 revised. 
In
December2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN 46 revised December2003, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses how a business enterprise
should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and, accordingly, should consolidate the entity. FIN 46R replaces FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was issued in January2003. The Company will be required to apply FIN 46R to variable interests in VIEs created after December31,
2003. For variable interests in VIEs created before January1, 2004, the Interpretation will be applied beginning on January1, 2005. For 
93  any
VIEs that must be consolidated under FIN 46R that were created before January1, 2004, the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the VIE initially would be measured at their
carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change. If
determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair value at the date FIN 46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE. The Company
does not currently expect the adoption of FIN 46R to have a material impact on the 2004 consolidated financial statements.

2In
November2002, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the appropriate parties to resolve all current and future asbestos-related claims made against it and its
affiliates in connection with the Cryovac transaction. The parties signed a definitive settlement agreement as of November10, 2003 consistent with the terms of the agreement in principle. In
connection with this settlement, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $8501million in the consolidated statement of operations in 2002, which resulted in the Company net
loss for the year ended December31, 2002. See Note18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 1. Business 1 Item 2. Properties 5 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 6 Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders 6 Executive Officers of the Registrant 6 Part II Item 5. Controls and Procedures 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that the Company employees accumulate this information and communicate it to the Company management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily must apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
As
of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company management, including the Company Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company disclosure controls and procedures under Rule13a-15. Based upon
that evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
There
has not been any change in the Company internal control over financial reporting during the Company most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting.

PART III
