and March 30,     F-37                   -F-1        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To PSS World Medical, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PSS World
Medical, Inc. a Florida corporation and subsidiaries as of March 30, 2001 and
March 31, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended March 30, 2001. These financial statements and the schedule referred to
below are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of PSS World Medical, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 30, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective April
3, 1999, the Company changed certain of its accounting principles for revenue
recognition as a result of the adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
Revenue Recognition.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index to the
consolidated financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with
the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole. s/ Arthur Andersen LLP

MARCH 30, 2001, MARCH 31, 2000, AND APRIL 2, 1999
Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Data, Unless Otherwise Noted  1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company and Nature of Business
PSS World Medical, Inc. the Company or PSS was incorporated in 1983
in Jacksonville, Florida. The Company, through its Physician Sales &
Service division Physician Supply Business is a distributor of medical
supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals to primary care and other
office-based physicians in the United States. As of March 30, 2001, the
Company operated 49 service centers distributing to over 100,000 physician
office sites in all 50 states.
In March 1996, PSS established two wholly-owned subsidiaries, WorldMed
International, Inc. WorldMed Int'l and WorldMed, Inc., together, the
International Business, to manage and develop the Company European
medical equipment and supply distribution market. As of March 30, 2001, the
European operation included two service centers distributing to acute and
alternate care sites in Belgium and Germany. Subsequent to year-end, the
Company sold its International Business Refer to Note 20, Subsequent
Events.
In November 1996, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary,
Diagnostic Imaging, Inc. DI or the Imaging Business. DI is a
distributor of medical diagnostic imaging supplies, chemicals, equipment,
and services to the acute and alternate care markets in the United States.
As of March 30, 2001, DI operated 34 imaging division service centers
distributing to approximately 24,000 customer sites in 42 states.
In March 1998, the Company entered the long-term care market for the
distribution of medical supplies and other products with its acquisition of
Gulf South Medical Supply, Inc. Gulf South or the Long-Term Care
Business. As of March 30, 2001, Gulf South, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PSS, operated 14 long-term care distribution service centers serving over
14,000 long-term care accounts in all 50 states.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries using the fiscal year-ends discussed
below. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The
results of operations of companies acquired in purchase business
transactions are included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from the dates of acquisition.
Fiscal Year
The Company fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to March 31 of each
year. Fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999 each consist of 52 weeks.
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
-F-7   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, including cash
and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term trade receivables,
and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to the short-term
nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of the senior
subordinated debt is estimated using quoted market prices. The carrying
value of the Company senior subordinated debt at March 30, 2001 and March
31, 2000 was $125,000 and the market value was approximately $104,000 and
$115,000, respectively. The carrying value of the Company other long-term
debt was $66,792 and $134,233, at March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000,
respectively, which approximates fair value.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash held at banks,
short-term government obligations, commercial paper, and money market
instruments. The Company invests its excess cash in high-grade investments
and, therefore, bears minimal risk. These instruments have original
maturity dates not exceeding three months.
Marketable Securities
The Company holds investments classified as available-for-sale securities.
Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses excluded from earnings but reported in other comprehensive
income, net of the effect of income taxes, until sold. At the time of sale,
any gains or losses are recognized as a component of operating results.
Gains and losses are based on the specific identification method of
determining cost.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company trade accounts receivables are exposed to credit risk.
However, the majority of the market served by the Physician Supply Business
and Imaging Business are comprised of numerous individual accounts, none of
which is individually significant to the Company. Gulf South depends on a
limited number of large customers, and Gulf South customers have been
experiencing significant financial difficulty since the advent of the
Prospective Payment System PPS. Approximately 35%, 34%, and 38% of Gulf
South revenues for the years ended March 30, 2001, March 31, 2000, and
April 2, 1999, respectively, represent sales to its top five customers. As
of March 30, 2001, the top five customers represented 27% of Gulf South
gross accounts receivable and 24% of Gulf South accounts receivable, net
of allowance for doubtful accounts. As of March 31, 2000, the top five
customers represented 32% of Gulf South gross accounts receivable and 34%
of Gulf South accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful
accounts. In addition, as of March 31, 2001, one of Gulf South top five
customers was in bankruptcy and represented approximately 9% of Gulf
South sales and less than 2% of the Company consolidated sales. The
Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers on an ongoing basis
and provides reserves for estimated bad debt losses and sales returns.
The Company had allowances for doubtful accounts and notes receivable of
approximately $18,742 and $12,418 as of March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000,
respectively, of which $15,176 and $7,524, respectively, related to Gulf
South. Provisions for doubtful accounts were approximately $24,240,
$15,812, and $5,181, for fiscal ended 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively, of which $22,785, $11,193, and $2,485, respectively, related
to Gulf South.
During the quarter ended December 29, 2000, the Company recorded a bad debt
charge of $19,991 in its Long-Term Care Business refer to Note 3, Charges
Included in General and Administrative Expenses.                   -F-8   Inventories
Inventories, which are comprised principally of medical and related
products, are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market.
Market is defined as net realizable value. A company-wide physical
inventory observation is performed semiannually. Any inventory that is
impaired for any reason is disposed of or written down to fair market value
at that time. Management reviews all branch inventory valuations and makes
additional adjustments if necessary.
Slow moving inventory is tracked using a report that details items that
have not moved in the last 180 to 360 days and an appropriate reserve is
established. Once slow moving inventory is identified, branches transfer
inventory to other branches with a market for that inventory. If management
determines the inventory is not saleable, the inventory is written off
against the allowance for obsolete inventory.
Property and Equipment
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to 39 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lease terms or the estimated useful
lives, whichever is shorter. Gain or loss upon retirement or disposal of
property and equipment is recorded in other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations.
The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for
sale by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows. At the time such evaluations indicate that
the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not
sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets, the assets are
adjusted to their fair values.
The Company capitalizes the following costs associated with developing
internal-use computer software: i external direct costs of materials and
services consumed in developing or obtaining  internal-use  computer
software; ii certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who
are directly associated with the development of internal-use software, to
the extent of the time spent directly on the project; and iii interest
costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized
internal-use software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives
of the software, ranging from 7 to 10 years.
Intangibles
Noncompetition agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
lives of the agreements, which range from 3 to 15 years. The Company has
classified as goodwill the cost in excess of the fair value of net
identifiable assets purchased in business acquisitions that are accounted
for as purchase transactions. Goodwill is being amortized over 15 to 30
years using the straight-line method. The Company periodically evaluates
intangible assets to determine if an impairment exists.
Self-Insurance Coverage
The Company has a self-funded program for employee and dependent health
coverage. This program includes an administrator, a large provider network,
and stop loss reinsurance to cover individual claims in excess of $175 per
person and up to $10 million catastrophic loss maximum, per life time
benefit, per person. Claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on
estimates of claims provided by the third party administrator and are
included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.
Contingent Loss Accruals
In determining the accrual necessary for probable loss contingencies as
defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 5,
Accounting for Contingencies SFAS 5, the Company includes estimates for
professional fees, such as legal, accounting, and consulting, and other
related costs to be incurred, unless such fees and related costs are not
probable of being incurred or are not reasonably estimable.                   -F-9   Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for income
taxes. Deferred income taxes result primarily from the net tax effect of
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes.
Shareholders' Equity
The Company realizes an income tax benefit from the exercise or early
disposition of certain stock options. This benefit results in a decrease in
current income taxes payable and a direct increase in additional paid-in
capital refer to Note 10, Income Taxes.
Other Comprehensive Income
Cumulative other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income has
been separately disclosed in the accompanying consolidated statements of
shareholders' equity.
Revenue Recognition
Effective April 3, 1999, the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101, Revenue Recognition SAB 101, which changed its method for
accounting for equipment sales and contingent rebate income for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2000. The cumulative effect of this accounting change
reduced net income for the year ended March 31, 2000, by $14 million $24
million pre-tax. The cumulative after tax effect on both the basic and
diluted earnings per share was a reduction of $002 per share. The effect
of SAB 101, before the cumulative effect, did not have a material impact on
fiscal 2000 and would not have been material to fiscal 1999.
Revenue from the sale of products and equipment with no installation and
training requirements is recognized when products are shipped. Revenue from
the sale of equipment with installation and training requirements is
recognized when installation and training are complete. Revenue from
service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.
The Company earns incentive rebates from its vendors if certain performance
goals are achieved. Incentive rebate income is recognized in the accounting
period in which the Company meets the performance measure.
The Company allows customers to return products under its no hassle
customer guarantee, and customers are issued credit memos. The Company
records an allowance for estimated sales returns and allowances at the end
of each period. Sales returns and allowances estimates, which are included
in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets, are based on
historical experience.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements for the International Business are translated into
U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and
weighted average exchange rates for income and expenses. The resulting
translation adjustments are recorded in the cumulative other comprehensive
income component of shareholders' equity.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method. The Company adopted the disclosure only provisions
of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 for
employee and director stock-based compensation. In accordance with SFAS
123, for footnote disclosure purposes only, the Company computes its
earnings and earnings per share on a pro forma basis as if the fair value
method had been applied.
Earnings Per Common Share
Basic and diluted earnings per common share are presented in accordance
with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128. Basic earnings per
common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average                   -F-10   number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share includes
the dilutive effect of stock options refer to Note 11, Earnings Per
Share.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
During June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS 133. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective
Date of FASB Statement 133 SFAS 137, which delays the effective date of
SFAS 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The effect of
adopting the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal
2002 was not material.
During September 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF issued EITF
No. 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs EITF
00-10, which addresses the income statement classification of amounts
charged to customers for, as well as costs incurred related to, shipping
and handling. The effective date of EITF 00-10 was the quarter ended March
30, 2001. EITF 00-10 requires that amounts billed to a customer in a sale
transaction related to shipping and handling be classified as revenue. In
addition, if costs incurred related to shipping and handling are
significant and are not included in cost of sales, an entity should
disclose both the amount of such costs and the income statement
classification.
Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are classified as revenues
for all periods presented; previously, these revenues were offset against
the related costs incurred, which were included in general and
administrative expenses. Revenues from shipping and handling for each of
the three years in the periods ended 2001, 2000, and 1999 were $11,180,
$10,454 and $2,663, respectively. Costs related to shipping and handling
are classified as general and administrative expenses and were $79,562,
$76,487 and $64,945, during each of the three years in the periods ended
2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.  2. BUSINESS ACQUISTIONS
Purchase Acquisitions
During fiscal 2000, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of 6 medical supply and equipment distributors, 12 imaging
supply and equipment distributors, and 2 long-term health care
distributors. In addition, the Company acquired the common stock of 4
imaging supply and equipment distributors. A summary of the details of the
transactions follow                   -F-11                                  Fiscal Year

earnout payments.
The operations of the acquired companies have been included in the Company
results of operations subsequent to the dates of acquisition. Supplemental
unaudited pro forma information, assuming these acquisitions had been made
at the beginning of the year in which the acquisition was made, and assuming
the acquisitions were made at the beginning of the immediate preceding year,
is included below. The unaudited pro forma selected financial data does not
purport to represent what the Company results of operation would actually
have been had the transactions in fact occurred as of an earlier date or
project the results for any future date or period.                                     Fiscal Year

$031     $069   These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, and accordingly, the assets of the acquired companies have been
recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of the acquisitions.
The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net
identifiable assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill and is amortized
over 15 to 30 years. Goodwill was reduced by $494 during fiscal 2001 to
reflect purchase price allocations of acquisitions consummated in fiscal
2000. Remaining contingent earnouts of $24 million will be assessed in
fiscal 2002 and final purchase price allocations will be completed at that
time.
Merger costs and expenses
During fiscal 2000, the Company recorded approximately $595 of merger
integration costs and expenses directly to goodwill as incurred as these
costs were contemplated at the time of acquisition. In addition, during
fiscal 2000, the Company recorded approximately $489 of merger costs
and expenses related to other acquisitions directly to goodwill for costs
that were in excess of the original integration plan accrual estimated by
management. Such merger costs and expenses are recorded directly to
goodwill only if it is within one year from the date of the acquisition and
such expenses were contemplated at the time of the acquisition. If merger
costs and expenses are incurred subsequent to one year from the date of the
acquisition, or were not contemplated at the time of the acquisition, such
expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses.
Reversal of excess accrued merger costs and expenses
During fiscal 2000, the Company reversed approximately $712 of certain
accrued merger costs and expenses that management determined to be
unnecessary due to changes in integration plans or estimates. Management
evaluates integration plans at each period end and determines if revisions
to the accruals are appropriate. Such revisions to the original estimates
are recorded directly to goodwill.
Deferred tax assets of acquired companies
During fiscal 2001, the Company increased goodwill by approximately
$420 and during fiscal 1999, the Company reduced goodwill by
approximately $2,644. These adjustments reflect a true-up of the deferred
tax assets and liabilities per the financial statements and the tax return,
as a result of additional information received on the deductibility of
certain pre-acquisition expenditures.
-F-12   In addition, the terms of certain of the Company recent acquisition
agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid earnout
payments if the acquired entity results of operations exceed certain
targeted levels. Targeted levels are generally set above the historical
experience of the acquired entity at the time of acquisition. Such
additional consideration is to be paid in cash and is recorded when earned
as additional purchase price. The maximum amount of remaining contingent
consideration is approximately $24 million payable through fiscal 2002.
During the year ended March 30, 2001, there were earnout payments related
to two Imaging Business acquisitions totaling $19 million. These amounts
were recorded as an adjustment to goodwill related to the acquisitions.
There were no earnout payments made during fiscal 2000 and 1999. 3.  CHARGES INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

the Retention Plans. As part of the Company strategic alternatives
process, management adopted these plans to retain certain officers and key
employees during the transition period. The total costs related to these                   -F-13   plans is approximately $10,059 of which $4,754 and $1,002 were expensed
during the years ended March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, respectively, and
$2,872, and $1,431 will be recognized as expense in fiscal 2002 and 2003,
respectively.

During the quarter ended December 29, 2000, management approved and
adopted a formal plan, among other things, to restructure certain
leadership positions within the Company Plan E. This plan includes
costs related to the severance of certain members of senior management
including the Company former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Accordingly, the Company recorded restructuring costs and expenses of
$4,887 at the commitment date of the restructuring plan adopted by
management and an additional $644 in severance costs in the quarter
ended March 30,  2001.  The Company also  recorded  $3,446 of

Fiscal 2000
During the quarter ended September 30, 1999, management approved and
adopted a formal plan to restructure certain operations of Gulf South
Plan C, an additional component to the previously established
Plans A and B. This restructuring plan identified five additional
distribution  centers and the Gulf South corporate facility as
redundant or inadequate for future operations. As a result, these
locations were closed and made permanently idle. Accordingly, the
Company recorded restructuring costs and expenses of $4,967 at the
commitment date of the restructuring plan adopted by management. Such
costs include branch shutdown costs, lease termination costs, and
involuntary employee termination costs of $494, $2,915, and $1,558,
respectively. Refer to Note 4, Accrued Merger and Restructuring Costs
and Expenses, for further discussion regarding the restructuring plan.
Restructuring costs and expenses for the year ended March 31, 2000
also included $9,213 of charges that were expensed as incurred and
primarily relate to other exit costs. Other exit costs include costs
to pack and move inventory, costs to set up new facilities, employee
relocation costs, and other related facility closure costs. In
addition, the Company reversed $1,341 of restructuring costs into
income, which related to over-accrual for lease termination costs, and
involuntary employee termination costs.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2000, management approved and
adopted another formal plan to restructure the Imaging Business' sales
and service organization and the shut down of two facilities Plan
D. Accordingly,  the Company recorded restructuring costs and
expenses of $318 at the commitment date of the restructuring plan
adopted by  management.  Refer to Note 4, Accrued  Merger and
Restructuring Costs and Expenses, for further discussion regarding the
restructuring plan. Restructuring costs and expenses for the quarter

as incurred and primarily relate to other exit costs. Other exit costs
include costs to pack and move inventory, costs to set up new
facilities, employee relocation costs, and other related facility
closure costs.
Fiscal 1999
During the quarter ended June 30, 1998, management approved and
adopted Plan B, an additional Gulf South component to the 1998
restructuring plan or Plan A. This restructuring plan identified two
additional distribution centers and two corporate offices to be merged
with existing facilities and identified three executives to be
involuntarily  terminated.  Accordingly,  the  Company  recorded
restructuring costs and expenses of $1,503 at the commitment date of
the restructuring plan adopted by management. Such costs include
branch shutdown costs, lease termination costs, involuntary employee
termination costs of $281, $570, and $652, respectively.
The remaining $3,419 of restructuring costs recorded during fiscal

respectively. Other exit costs include                   -F-14      costs to pack and move inventory, costs to set up new facilities,
employee relocation costs, and other related facility closure costs.
Acceleration of Depreciation
During the quarter ended December 29, 2000, the Company identified certain
assets for replacement due to the implementation of its Enterprise Resource
Planning ERP system. Pursuant to SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121, the Company
evaluated the recoverability of the assets. Based on the Company
analysis, impairment did not exist at the division level; therefore,
management  reviewed its estimated  useful lives in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board No. 20, Accounting Changes APB 20, and
recorded $1,504 of accelerated depreciation.
In connection with the Gulf South merger during fiscal 1998, management
evaluated the adequacy of the combined companies' information systems. The
Company concluded that its existing information systems were not compatible
with those of Gulf South and not adequate to support the future internal
growth of the combined companies and expected growth resulting from future
acquisitions. Pursuant to SFAS 121, the Company evaluated the
recoverability of the information system assets. Based on the Company
analysis, impairment did not exist at the division level; therefore,
management reviewed its estimated useful lives in accordance with APB 20
and recorded $5,379 of incremental depreciation expense resulting from
management decision to replace its information systems.
Long-Term Care Business Bad Debt Charge
During the quarter ended December 29, 2000, the Company recorded $19,991 of
bad debt expense to increase the accounts receivable reserves at Gulf South
Medical Supply. The increase to the reserve balance was primarily
attributed to changes in assumptions concerning customers currently in
bankruptcy based on information acquired during the quarter, including the
fact that the Company did not receive critical vendor designation for
certain customers as it had received for other bankrupt customers in the
past. In addition, the increase was also attributed to i changes in
reserve assumptions for non-performing customers based on the change in
assumptions discussed above, ii changes in management credit policies
and procedures, and iii changes in credit and collection department
management. Based on information currently available, management believes
the Company has recorded appropriate reserves for uncollectible
receivables.
Goodwill Impairment Charge
During fiscal 2000, the Imaging Business closed its Metro New York
facility. The closure of this facility triggered an asset impairment as
determined under SFAS 121. As a result, goodwill of $517 was written off
during fiscal 2000.
Operational Tax Charge
During the year ended March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, the Company
performed an analysis and reversed $749 and $1,221, respectively, of a
previously recorded operating tax charge reserve.
Other
During the year ended March 30, 2001, the Company incurred $3,695,
primarily relating to legal and professional fees and other costs pursuant
to the Company strategic alternatives process and severance costs. In
addition, the Company incurred $94 of costs related to acquisitions not
consummated. During the year ended April 2, 1999, the Company
incurred approximately $1,010 of costs related to acquisitions not
consummated.  4. ACCRUED MERGER AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND EXPENSES
Summary of Accrued Merger Costs and Expenses
In connection with the consummation of business combinations, management
often develops formal plans to exit certain activities, involuntarily
terminate employees, and relocate employees of the acquired companies.                   -F-15   Management plans to exit an activity often include identification of
duplicate facilities for closure and identification of facilities for
consolidation into other facilities.
Generally, completion of the integration plans will occur within one year
from the date in which the plans were formalized and adopted by management.
However, intervening events occurring prior to completion of the plan, such
as subsequent acquisitions or system conversion issues, can significantly
impact a plan that had been previously established. Such intervening events
may cause modifications to the plans and are accounted for on a prospective
basis. At the end of each quarter, management reevaluates its integration
plans and adjusts previous estimates.
As part of the integration plans, certain costs are recognized at the date
in which the plan is formalized and adopted by management commitment
date. These costs are generally related to employee terminations and
relocation, lease terminations, and branch shutdown. In addition, there are
certain costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment
date and are expensed as the plan is implemented refer to Note 3, Charges
Included in General and Administrative Expenses. Involuntary employee
termination costs are employee severance costs and termination benefits.
Lease termination costs are lease cancellation fees and forfeited deposits.
Branch shutdown costs include costs related to facility closure costs.
Employee relocation costs are moving costs of employees of an acquired
company in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting.
Accrued merger costs and expenses, classified as accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, were $294 and $1,089, at March
30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, respectively. The discussion of the accrued
merger costs and expenses below summarize the significant and
nonsignificant integration plans adopted by management for business
combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and
pooling-of-interests method of accounting. Integration plans are considered
to be significant if the charge recorded to establish the accrual is in
excess of 5% of consolidated pretax income.
Significant Poolings-of-Interests Business Combination Plan
The Company formalized and adopted an integration plan in December 1997 to
integrate the operations of S with the Imaging Business. As of December
31, 1999, all of the employees had been terminated and all of the seven
identified distribution facilities had been shut down. Therefore, all costs
related to the merger plan had been incurred at March 30, 2001, except for
lease termination costs for one location for which payments will extend
through May 2001. During the year ended March 30, 2001, $86 of lease
expense was charged against the accrual leaving a remaining accrual of $16.
Nonsignificant Poolings-of-Interests Business Combination Plans
The Imaging Business acquired Tristar Imaging Systems, Inc. in October
1998, and management formalized and adopted an integration plan in late
fiscal 1999 to integrate the operations of the acquired company. Management
determined that all costs related to the merger plan had been incurred at
March 30, 2001. During the year ended March 30, 2001, $397 of lease
expense was charged against the accrual and the Company reversed
approximately $148 of merger costs and expenses previously established
under prior plans, all of which is related to lease terminations.
Therefore, no accrual remains at March 30, 2001.
Nonsignificant Purchase Business Combination Plan
The Imaging Business acquired South Jersey X-Ray, Inc. in October 1998, and
management formalized and adopted an integration plan during the three
months ended June 30, 1999 to integrate the operations of the acquired
company. All costs related to the merger plan had been incurred at March
30, 2001, except for lease termination costs for which payments will extend
through fiscal 2004. During the year ended March 30, 2001, $108 of
lease expense and $56 of employee termination costs were charged against
the accrual leaving a remaining balance of $278.
Summary of Accrued Restructuring Costs and Expenses
Primarily as a result of the impact of the Gulf South merger, in order to
improve customer service, reduce costs, and improve productivity and asset
utilization, the Company decided to realign and consolidate its operations.
Accordingly, the Company began implementing a restructuring plan during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, which impacted all divisions Plan A. The                   -F-16   accrued restructuring costs related to Plan A were fully utilized at March
30, 2001. Subsequently, the Company adopted a second restructuring plan
during the first quarter of fiscal 1999 related to the Gulf South Medical
Supply division Plan B to further consolidate its operations.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, management evaluated the
Company overall cost structure and implemented cost reductions in order
to meet internal profitability targets. In addition, management decided to
improve its distribution model and relocate the corporate office for Gulf
South to Jacksonville, Florida where the corporate offices for the Imaging
and Physician Supply Businesses are located. The Company implemented the
restructuring plan during the second quarter of fiscal 2000 that impacted
all divisions Plan C. The total number of employees to be terminated
was 272.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Imaging Business' management
made a discretionary decision to change its business strategy and the way
it operates to improve future operations. These changes include
restructuring the Imaging Business sales force, terminating approximately
50 service engineers, and closure of two distribution centers Plan D.
All employees were terminated as of June 30, 2000, and the accruals
relating to Plan D were fully utilized at March 30, 2001.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company Board of Directors
along with senior management evaluated the Company operating performance.
During this process, the Board and management decided to implement a
long-range action plan that would stabilize the workforce and business. As
part of the new strategic plan, the Company planned to reorganize several
senior management positions and make permanently idle two distribution
centers; one in the Diagnostic Imaging division and one in the Physician
Supply division Plan E. The total number of employees to be terminated
in Plan E is 29.

Fair Value of Stock Options
Under SFAS 123, pro forma information regarding net income loss and
earnings per share has been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee and director stock options under the fair value method. The
fair value of stock options granted has been estimated using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value of PSS' stock options Broad-Based Employee Stock Plan,
Incentive Stock Option Plan, Long-Term Stock Plan, Long-Term Incentive
Plans, and Directors' Stock Plan granted during fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999
have been estimated based on the following weighted average assumptions: i
risk-free interest rates ranging from 44% to 64%; ii expected option
life ranging from 2 to 725 years; iii expected volatility of 750   600%, and 560%, respectively; and iv no expected dividend yield. Using
these assumptions, the estimated fair values of options granted for fiscal
2001, 2000, and 1999, were approximately $4,839, $2,842, and $9,091,
respectively, and such amounts would be included in compensation expense.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the
expected stock price volatility. Because the Company employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in management opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its employee stock options.
Pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share for the fiscal
years ended 2001, 2000, and 1999, assuming the Company had accounted for
the plans under the fair value approach, are as follows in thousands,
except per share data                        2001    2000    1999

Because the fair value method of accounting has not been applied to options
granted prior to March 31, 1996, the resulting pro forma compensation cost
may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.                   -F-29 14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors an employee stock ownership plan PSS ESOP
available to all employees with at least one year of service. Employees can
invest their contributions in various mutual funds as well as the common
stock of the Company. Employer contributions are invested in the common
stock of the Company.
A company acquired in fiscal 1999 sponsored a leveraged employee stock
ownership plan Tristar ESOP. The Tristar ESOP was merged into the PSS
ESOP effective August 6, 1999, and the note payable to a third party was
replaced with financing from the holding company. As a result of the
merger, the PSS ESOP became a leveraged ESOP. The supplemental matches for
fiscal 2001 and 2000 were $154 and $234, respectively. The Company accounts
for the PSS ESOP in accordance with SOP 93-6, Employers Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Accordingly,  the shares pledged as
collateral are reported as unearned ESOP shares in the balance sheet. As
shares are released from collateral, the Company reports compensation
expense equal to the then current market price of the shares, and the
shares become outstanding for the earnings per share computation.
The PSS ESOP owned approximately 2,997,000 and 1,606,000 shares of the
Company common stock at March 30, 2001 and March 31, 2000, respectively.
Company contributions to the plan, excluding the supplemental match, were
approximately $1,108, $1,417, and $123, for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively, and are made at the discretion of the Company.   The following presents the PSS ESOP share activity:      2001    2000     1999

expense was recognized in fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan available to employees
with at least one year of service. The plan allows eligible employees to
purchase company stock over-the-counter through payroll deductions.
PSS Deferred Compensation Program
The Company offers a deferred compensation program the Program to
qualified executives, management, and salespeople. The Program, which is an
unfunded plan, is comprised of a deferred compensation plan and a stock
option program. The Company has purchased life insurance as a means to
finance the benefits that become payable under the plan.
Under the deferred compensation plan, participants can elect to defer up to
100% of their total compensation. The Company makes matching contributions
of up to 10% to 15% of the participant deferral. The match contribution
ranges from 25% to 125% of the participant deferral.
Under the stock option plan, participants are granted stock options to
purchase common stock of the Company. The number of stock options granted
is a function of the participant annual deferral amount plus the Company
match. The grant price of the option is determined annually to reflect an
exercise price which allows the annual deferral amount to be supplemented
by the growth of the PSS stock in excess of the declared interest rate
projected to compound for four years. Thus, the option price is not less
than the fair market value of the common stock on the date such option is
granted.
Participant contributions are always 100% vested. The Company match and the
stock options vest as follows                   -F-30         # of Years in the plan      Vesting %

Death or disability        100   After the options are 100% vested, participants can exercise up to 25% of
vested options in any calendar year.
At age 60, or age 55 with 10 years of participation in the Program, the
retirement benefit is distributed to participants in five equal annual
installments, or in a lump sum payment if the vested account balance is $25
or less. The retirement benefit is distributed in a lump sum upon death and
over five years upon disability. In the event of termination of employment,
100% of the participant vested balance will be distributed in five equal
installments, or in a lump sum payment if the vested account balance is $25
or less.
During fiscal 2001 and 2000, the Company matched approximately $1,186 and
$864, respectively, of employee deferrals. At March 30, 2001 and March 31,
2000, approximately $6,400 and $4,696, respectively, is recorded in other
long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In
addition, $6,684 and $5,561 of deferred compensation is included in other
long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at
March 30, 2001 and March 30, 2000, respectively. 15. OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

-F-32 17. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED
The following table presents summarized unaudited quarterly results of
operations for the Company for fiscal 2001 and 2000. The Company
believes all necessary adjustments have been included in the amounts stated
below to present fairly the following selected information when read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
Future quarterly operating results may fluctuate depending on a number of
factors, including the timing of business acquisitions, and changes in
customer buying patterns of supplies, diagnostic equipment and
pharmaceuticals. Results of operations for any particular quarter are not
necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or any
other quarter.
Reclassification - EITF 00-10
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company adopted the
provisions of EITF 00-10 see Note 1, Background and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, for related discussion. Accordingly, amounts billed
to customers for shipping and handling were reclassified to net sales for
each of the quarters presented for fiscal 2001 and 2000. In addition, other
immaterial amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Restatements
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company restated its
previously issued consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended
June 30, 2000, September 30, 2000, and December 29, 2000.
As a result of an analysis of the Company accounts receivable records
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company recorded adjustments
to reduce sales and accounts receivable by $16 million, $19 million, and
$05 million during the first, second, and third quarters of fiscal 2001,
respectively.

-F-34 18.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company has employment agreements with certain executive officers which
provide that in the event of their termination or resignation, under
certain conditions, the Company may be required to continue salary payments
and provide insurance for a period ranging from 3 to 12 months for certain
executives and to repurchase a portion or all of the shares of common stock
held by the executives upon their demand at the fair market value at the
time of repurchase. The period of salary and insurance continuation and the
level of stock repurchases are based on the conditions of the termination
or resignation.
During fiscal 2000, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the PSS
World Medical, Inc. Officer Retention Bonus Plan and the PSS World Medical,
Inc. Corporate Office Employee Retention Bonus Plan. Refer to Note 3,
Charges included in General and Administrative Expenses for further
discussion.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company received
approximately $65 million relating to a favorable medical x-ray film
antitrust settlement claim. The amount is classified as other income in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
The Company, through its Gulf South Medical Supply subsidiary, Physician
Sales & Service subsidiary and/or predecessor companies, has been named as
one of many defendants in latex glove product liability claims in various
Federal and state courts. The defendants are primarily distributors of
certain brands of latex gloves. Currently, state litigation exists in New
Hampshire, Illinois, Massachusetts and California, while Federal and/or
Federal multi-district litigation is present in Washington, Georgia,
Indiana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Defense costs are currently
allocated by agreement between a consortium of insurers on a pro rata basis
for each case depending upon policy years and alleged years of exposure.
All of the insurance carriers are defending subject to a reservation of
rights. Ultimately, the manufacturers from which the gloves were purchased
may assume the defense and liability obligations. The Company intends to
vigorously defend the proceeding.
The Company and certain of its current officers and directors were named as
defendants in a purported securities class action lawsuit filed on or about
May 28, 1998. The allegations are based upon a decline in the Company
stock price following announcements by the Company in May 1998 regarding
the Gulf South merger,  which resulted in earnings below analyst
expectations. The defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint was granted
by order dated February 9, 2000. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on
March 15, 2000. Defendants' motion to dismiss, filed May 1, 2000, is still
pending. The Company believes that the allegations contained in the
complaint are without merit and intends to defend vigorously against the
claims. However, the lawsuit is in the earliest stages, and there can be no
assurance that this litigation will ultimately be resolved on terms that
are favorable to the Company.
Although the Company does not manufacture products, the distribution of
medical supplies and equipment entails inherent risks of product liability.
Other than discussed above, the Company has not experienced any significant
product liability claims and maintains  product liability  insurance
coverage. In addition, the Company is also a party to various legal and
administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of
business.  While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty,
management, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, believes
that the outcome of any proceedings or claims which are pending or known to
be threatened will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.
On September 30, 1999, DI entered into a three year distributorship
agreement with an imaging supply vendor. The agreement stipulates that,
among other things, in the event of termination of the agreement due to a
change in control of DI, the Company will pay liquidated damages to the
vendor in the amount of the lesser of $6 million or $250,000 times the
number of months remaining under the agreement.                   -F-35 19. ABBOTT LABORATORIES DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
On March 27, 1995, the Company signed a Distribution Agreement with Abbott
Laboratories providing for the exclusive distribution of certain Abbott
diagnostic products. The Abbott Agreement, effective April 1, 1995, had a
five-year term. Simultaneous with the closing of the Abbott Agreement,
Abbott purchased 825,000 unregistered, restricted shares of PSS common
stock. A three-year irrevocable proxy to the PSS Board of Directors and a
perpetual stand still agreement were provided by Abbott in the Stock
Purchase Agreement.
On December 1, 2000, the Company renewed the Distribution Agreement with
Abbott Laboratories for an additional term of 3 years. 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Subsequent to year-end, the Company sold its International Business, to the
then management of the European operations, in the first quarter of fiscal
2002. The Company believes that no further losses related to exit
activities will be recorded.
On May 24, 2001, the Company refinanced its existing Amended Credit
Agreement with a Credit Facility refer to Note 9, Long-Term Debt and
Capital Lease Obligations.                   -F-36         SCHEDULE II--VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS
