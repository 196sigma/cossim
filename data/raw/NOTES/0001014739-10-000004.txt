of Directors and Stockholders
BioScrip,
Inc.
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BioScrip, Inc. and
subsidiariesas of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at . These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of BioScrip, Inc. and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, BioScrip, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March 2, 2010, expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

NOTE1NATURE
OF BUSINESS
Corporate
Organization and Business
BioScrip,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company or BioScrip is a specialty
pharmaceutical healthcare organization that partners with patients, physicians,
healthcare payors and pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide access to
medications and management solutions to optimize outcomes for chronic and other
complex healthcare conditions.
BioScrips
business is reported under two operating segments: i Specialty Pharmacy
Services, and ii Traditional Pharmacy Services.The Specialty
Pharmacy Services segment includes comprehensive support, dispensing and
distribution, patient care management, data reporting, as well as a range of
other complex therapy management services for certain chronic and acute health
conditions.The medications we dispense include oral, injectable and
infusible medications which are used to treat patients living with chronic and
other complex health conditions.The Traditional Pharmacy Services
segment consists mainly of traditional mail service pharmacy fulfillment, and to
a lesser extent, prescription discount card programs and fully funded pharmacy
benefit management PBM services.
The
Company distributes high-cost pharmaceuticals and provides clinically focused
case and disease management programs to healthcare payors including managed care
organizations, government-funded and/or operated programs, third party
administrators TPAs and self-funded employer groups collectively, Plan
Sponsors, enrollees afflicted with chronic and other complex health
conditions. The disease states or conditions for which the Company has such
programs include Psoriasis, Growth Hormone Deficiency, Thyroid Cancer, Sickle
Cell/Thalassemia, Hemophilia, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis,
Osteoarthritis, Osteoporosis, Solid Organ Transplants, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis
CB and RSV. The specialty drugs distributed through the BioScrip programs
are dispensed and serviced from the Companys 43 specialty pharmacy locations
across the United States.
Basis
of Presentation
The
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles GAAP.
Reclassification
Certain
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation. Such reclassifications had no material effect on the Companys
previously reported consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.
Subsequent
Events
The
Company has evaluated events that occurred during the period subsequent to the
balance sheet date.With the exception of the pending acquisition
See Note 14 Subsequent Events, there were no subsequent events that require
recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

Table of Contents
NOTE2SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation
The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use
of Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management
to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Receivables
Receivables
include amounts due from certain third party payors and patient co-payments for
pharmacies owned by the Company, amounts due from Plan Sponsors under the
Companys PBM agreements, amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for
rebates, and service fees resulting from the distribution of certain drugs
through retail pharmacies.
Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts
Allowances
for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer
receivable balances. The procedure for estimating the allowance for doubtful
accounts requires significant judgment and assumptions. The risk of collection
varies based upon the product, the payor commercial health insurance,
government, and physician, the patients ability to pay the amounts not
reimbursed by the payor and the point of distribution retail, national mail.
The Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a variety
of factors including the age of the outstanding receivables and the historical
experience of collections, adjusting for current economic conditions and, in
certain cases, evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss. The
Company periodically reviews the estimation process and makes changes to the
estimates as necessary. When it is deemed that a customer account is
uncollectible, that balance is written off against the existing
allowance.
Allowance
for Contractual Discounts
The
Company is reimbursed for the medications and services it sells by Plan
Sponsors. Revenues and related accounts receivable are recorded net of payor
contractual discounts to reflect the estimated net billable amounts for the
products and services delivered. The Company estimates the allowance for
contractual discounts, based on historical experience and in certain cases on a
customer-specific basis, given its interpretation of the contract terms or
applicable regulations. However, the reimbursement rates are often subject to
interpretation that could result in payments that differ from estimates.
Additionally, updated regulations and contract negotiations occur frequently,
necessitating the continual review and assessment of the estimation
process.
Inventory
Inventory
is recorded at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
first-in, first-out method. Inventory consists principally of purchased
prescription drugs for the Companys traditional mail and specialty distribution
operations. Included in inventory is a reserve for expired
inventory.
Property
and Equipment
Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of assets. The estimated useful lives of the Companys assets are
as follows:
Asset
Useful Life
Computer
hardware and software
3-5
years
Office
equipment
3-5
years
Furniture
and fixtures
5-7
years
Leasehold
improvements and leased assets are amortized using a straight-line basis over
the related lease term or estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is
less.The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or
retired are removed from the accounts with the gain or loss, if applicable,
recorded in the statement of operations.Maintenance and repair costs
are expensed as incurred.
Costs
relating to the development of software for internal purposes are charged to
expense until technological feasibility is established in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 350, Intangibles Goodwill and
Other ASC 350. Thereafter, the remaining software production costs up
to the date placed into production are capitalized and included as Property and
Equipment.Amortization of the capitalized amounts commences on the
date the asset is ready for its intended use and is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
software.
41
Table of Contents
Amounts due to Plan Sponsors
Amounts
due to Plan Sponsors primarily represent overpayments that will be paid back to
Plan Sponsors in Specialty Pharmacy Services. In addition, these payables
include the sharing of manufacturers rebates with Plan Sponsors in the
Traditional Pharmacy Services segment.
Rebates
Manufacturers
rebates are primarily part of the Companys Specialty Pharmacy Services
segment.Rebates are generally volume-based incentives that are
earned and recorded upon dispense.Volume-based rebates are recorded
as a reduction of both inventory and cost of goods sold.
The
Traditional Pharmacy Services segment also includes rebates earned on the PBM
portion of the business.Rebates are recorded on historical PBM
results and trends and are revised on a regular basis depending on the Companys
latest forecasts, as well as information received from rebate
sources.Should actual results differ, adjustments will be recorded
in future earnings when the adjustment becomes known.In some
instances, rebate payments are shared with the Companys Plan
Sponsors.PBM rebates earned by the Company are recorded as a
reduction of cost of goods sold.PBM rebates shared with clients are
recorded as a reduction of revenue consistent with the sales incentive
provisions of ASCTopic 605, Revenue Recognition ASC
605.
Revenue
Recognition
The
Company generates revenue principally through the sale of prescription drugs,
which are dispensed either through a pharmacy participating in its pharmacy
network or a pharmacy owned by the Company. Revenue is generally derived under
fee-for-service agreements. Fee-for-service agreements include:
ispecialty and mail service agreements, where the Company dispenses
prescription medications through its pharmacy facilities and iiPBM
agreements, where prescription medications are dispensed through pharmacies
participating in the Companys retail pharmacy network as well as through its
traditional mail service facility.
Accounting
Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition:
Multiple-Element Arrangements ASC 605-25, addresses situations in
which there are multiple deliverables under one revenue arrangement with a
customer and provides guidance in determining whether multiple deliverables
should be recognized separately or in combination.The Company
provides a variety of therapies to patients.For infusion related
therapies the Company frequently provides the multiple deliverables of drug
delivery and related nursing services.After applying the criteria
from ASC 605-25, the Company concluded that separate units of accounting exist
in revenue arrangements where we provide multiple deliverables.
Under
fee-for-service agreements in the Specialty Pharmacy Services segment, drug
revenue is recognized at the time the drug is shipped, and nursing revenue is
recognized on the date of service. At that point, the earnings process is
considered complete and the Company has substantially accomplished the terms of
its transaction.In the Traditional Pharmacy Services segment,
revenue is recognizedwhen the pharmacy services are reported to the
Company through the point of sale POS claims processing system and the drug
is dispensed to the member.
Revenue
generated under PBM agreements is classified as either gross or net by the
Company based on whether it is acting as a principal or an agent in the
fulfillment of prescriptions through its retail pharmacy network. When the
Company independently has a contractual obligation to pay a network pharmacy
provider for benefits provided to its Plan Sponsors members, and therefore is
the primary obligor as defined in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, the
Company includes payments which include the drug ingredient cost from these
Plan Sponsors as revenue and payments to the network pharmacy providers as cost
of revenue. These transactions require the Company to pay network pharmacy
providers, assume credit risk of Plan Sponsors and act as a principal. If the
Company merely acts as an agent, and consequently administers Plan Sponsors
network pharmacy contracts, it does not have the primary obligation to pay the
network pharmacy and assume credit risk and as such records only the
administrative fees and not the drug ingredient cost as revenue.
Cost
of Revenue
Cost of
revenue includes the costs of prescription medications, pharmacy claims, fees
paid to pharmacies, shipping and other direct and indirect costs associated with
pharmacy management and administration, claims processing operations, mail order
services and nursing services, offset by volume and prompt pay discounts
received from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors and total
manufacturer rebates.

Table of Contents
Impairment
of Long Lived Assets
The
Company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate
the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets, including intangible
assets, may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not
be recoverable. The measurement of possible impairment is based on the ability
to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an
undiscounted basis. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based on the
present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent
risk of the underlying business.
Goodwill
In
accordance with ASC 350, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an
annual basis and whenever events or circumstances exist that indicate that the
carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.The
impairment evaluation is based on a two-step process.The first step
compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including
goodwill.If the first step indicates that the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step must be
performed which determines the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill.
The measurement of possible impairment is based upon the comparison of the
implied fair value of reporting unit to its carrying value.
Lease
Accounting
The
Company accounts for leasing transactions by recording rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease, starting on the date it
gains possession of leased property. Lease terms are generally five years, with
many containing options to extend for periods ranging from one to five years.
The Company includes tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays received
from landlords and the effect of any rent escalation clauses as adjustments to
straight-line rent expense over the expected life of the lease.The
Company does not enter into capital lease obligations due to certain covenant
requirements in our credit facility.
Income
Taxes
As part
of the process of preparing the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements,
management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in
which it operates. The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes ASC
740. ASC 740 requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred taxes are determined by
calculating the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial accounting and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. A
valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when, in the opinion
of management, it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to
realize the benefit from its deferred tax assets.
The
Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, as
prescribed by Federal tax laws and the tax laws of the state and local
jurisdictions in which it operates.The Companys uncertain tax
positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination and are
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when the recognition
threshold and measurement attributes of ASC 740 are met.Interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as income tax
expense.
Disclosure
of Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The
Companys financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents and
its line of credit. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents and the line
of credit approximate fair value due to their fully liquid or short-term
nature.
Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation
The
Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation expense under the
provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock
Compensation ASC 718.At December31, 2009, the
Company has one stock-based employee compensation plan the Plan pursuant to
which incentive stock options ISOs, non-qualified stock options NQSOs,
restricted stock, performance units and performance share awards may be granted
to employees and non-employee directors. Option and stock awards are typically
settled by issuing authorized but unissued shares of the Company.
The
Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the measurement
date using a binomial option-pricing model.The fair value of the
award is amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the requisite
service period. The Company expenses restricted stock awards based on vesting
requirements, including time elapsed, market conditions and/or performance
conditions.Because of these requirements, the weighted average
period for which the expense is recognized varies.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements
In June
2009, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-01, Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles ASC Topic 105 which established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification the Codification as the official single source of
authoritative GAAP.All previously existing accounting standards were
superseded at that date.All other accounting guidance not included
in the Codification will be considered non-authoritative.The
Codification also includes relevant SEC guidance organized using the same
topical structure in separate sections within the Codification.
Following
the Codification, FASB has stated that it will not issue new standards in the
form of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force
Abstracts.Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates
ASU that will serve to update the Codification, provide background
information about the guidance and provide the basis for conclusions on the
changes to the Codification.
The
Codification is not intended to change GAAP, but will change the way GAAP is
organized and presented.The Codification was effective for the
Companys third quarter 2009 financial statements and the principal impact is
limited to disclosures as all future references to authoritative accounting
literature will be referenced in accordance with the Codification.
In
September 2009, FASB issued ASU 2009-13, Multiple Element Arrangements
ASU 2009-13, which is effective for fiscal years beginning on or
after June 15, 2010.Early adoption is permitted.If early
adoption is elected and the period of adoption is not the beginning of the
entitys fiscal year, the entity will be required to apply the amendments of
this ASU retrospectively from the beginning of the entitys fiscal
year.An entity may elect, but will not be required, to adopt the
amendments in this ASU retrospectively for all prior periods. However, an entity
cannot apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to a period if it is
impracticable for it to report the change through retrospective application to
that prior period. 
ASU
2009-13 addresses the determination of when the individual deliverables included
in a multiple arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. ASU
2009-13 also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that
arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to
all deliverables using the relative selling price method. This standard must be
adopted by the Company no later than January1, 2011. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact, if any, that this standard update will have on
its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In
2009, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events ASC
855, which was effective for interim and annual periods after June 15, 2009
and amended on February 24, 2010.This Statement incorporates
guidance into accounting literature that was previously addressed only in
auditing standards. The statement refers to subsequent events that provide
additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance-sheet date as
recognized subsequent events.Subsequent events which provide
evidence about conditions that arose after an issuers most recent balance-sheet
date but prior to the issuance of its most recent financial statements are
referred to as non-recognized subsequent events.It also requires
companies to evaluate subsequent events through the date the financial
statements were issued.

OPERATING SEGMENTS
In
accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting ASC
280, and based on the nature of the Companys services, the Company has two
operating and reportable segments: Specialty Pharmacy Services and Traditional
Pharmacy Services.ASC 280 requires an enterprise to report segment
information in the same way that management internally organizes its business
for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of
resources.The Company evaluates the performance of operating
segments and allocates resources based on income from operations.
Revenues
from Specialty Pharmacy Services and Traditional Pharmacy Services are derived
from the Companys relationships with healthcare payors including Plan Sponsors
as well as from our relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers, patients and
physicians.
The
Specialty Pharmacy Services segment consists of the Companys specialty pharmacy
distribution and therapy management services.Specialty Pharmacy
Services distribution occurs locally through community pharmacies, centrally
through mail order facilities and through our infusion pharmacies for patients
requiring infused medications in the home or infused at a variety of sites
including the Companys ambulatory infusion sites.All Specialty
Pharmacy Services target certain specialty medications that are used to treat
patients living with chronic and other complex healthcare
conditions.
The
Traditional Pharmacy Services segment consists mainly of traditional mail order
pharmacy fulfillment, and to a lesser extent, prescription discount card
programs and integrated PBM services.These Traditional Pharmacy
Services are designed to offer Plan Sponsors cost-effective delivery of pharmacy
benefit plans including the low cost distribution of mail services for plan
members who receive traditional maintenance medications.
In the
quarter ended September 30, 2009, the Company renamed the reportable segment
formerly known as PBM Services to Traditional Pharmacy
Services.The decision to rename this segment reflects a shift in
the nature of the business included within this segment away from fully funded
pharmacy benefit management services and more towards traditional mail services
and prescription discount card programs.
The
accounting policies applied to the business segments are the same as those
described in Note 2 -Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation. Such reclassifications are deemed immaterial to segment data
presented below.There is no effect on previously reported net income
loss from operations.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES
The
Company follows ASC 350 in accounting and reporting for its goodwill and
intangible assets. ASC 350states that goodwill is no longer subject to
amortization over its estimated useful life. Goodwill is subject to at least an
annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value based
test.Management assesses impairment in the fourth quarter of each
year or whenever there is an impairment indicator.The Company
has two reporting units: Specialty Pharmacy Services and Traditional Pharmacy
Services.As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, all goodwill is
associated with the Specialty Pharmacy Services reporting
unit.Portions of goodwill are expected to be deductible for income
tax purposes.
Based on
its annual assessment for the year ended December 31, 2009, management
determined that the fair value of the Companys Specialty Pharmacy Services
reporting unit was greater than the carrying value of its net assets, and as
such, no impairment was incurred for fiscal year 2009.
In 2008,
the Company experienced a significant decline in its market capitalization below
book value, which was sustained through the fourth quarter of
2008.The Company also previously announced changes in the status of
long-term Specialty Pharmacy Services contracts.Those contract
changes included a the decision by United Healthcare UHC to internalize
services for HIV/AIDS and solid organ transplant drugs starting in the first
quarter of 2009, and b the expiration of the Competitive Acquisition Program
CAP with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services effective December
31, 2008.The expiration or termination of these contracts, the
reduced market capitalization of the Company and the reduced market
capitalization of the Companys peers in the healthcare industry were considered
to be potential indicators of impairment in contemplation of the Companys
annual impairment analysis.
Based on
its 2008 annual assessment, management determined that the fair value of the
Companys Specialty Pharmacy Services segment was less than the carrying value
of its net assets.The Company determined the fair value of the
Specialty Pharmacy Services segment using a combination of an income approach
using the discounted cash flow method and a market approach using the guideline
public company method.The Company completed step two of the
impairment analysis and concluded that the carrying value of the goodwill
associated with the Specialty Pharmacy Services segment was impaired, resulting
in a fourth quarter non-cash impairment charge of $900 million.

following table provides a reconciliation of goodwill in

As part
of the 2008 annual assessment and in consideration of the impairment indicators,
the Company also evaluated the recoverability of its property and equipment and
definite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350.As a
result, the Company determined that $39 million of definitive-lived intangible
assets, consisting of $35 million of customer lists and $04 million of
non-compete agreements, were impaired, and an impairment charge for this amount
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.These impairment tests
were performed and the related impairment charges were recorded prior to
completing the goodwill impairment analysis.

NOTE
7 LINE OF CREDIT
At
December 31, 2009, there was $304 million in outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility the Facility with an affiliate of Healthcare
Finance Group, Inc. HFG, as compared to $504 million at December 31,
2008.The Facility provides for borrowing up to $850 million at the
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR or a pre-determined minimum rate plus
the applicable margin and other associated fees, provided a sufficient level of
receivable assets are available as collateral.The term of the
Facility runs through November 1, 2010.Under the terms of the
Facility, the Company may request to increase the amount available for borrowing
up to $1000 million, and convert a portion of any outstanding borrowings from a
Revolving Loan into a Term Loan.The borrowing base utilizes
receivable balances and proceeds thereof as security under the
Facility.At December 31, 2009 the Company had $546 million of
credit available on a borrowing basis of $850 million under the
Facility.
The
weighted average interest rate on the line of credit was 44% during 2009
compared to 50% for 2008.
The
Facility contains various covenants that, among other things, require the
Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the agreements
governing the Facility.In December 2009, the Company and HFG agreed
to amend the terms of the Facility to revise certain calculations required by
the covenants. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants contained in
the agreements as of December 31, 2009.
As part
of the anticipated acquisition of CHS, the Company has received a financing
commitment from Jefferies Finance LLC Jefferies to provide a five year
senior credit facility in the amount of $1500 million, including a $500
million revolver, and a $2250 million bridge loan facility.The
bridge loan facility will be drawn on only if the $2250 million, five and a
half year unsecured notes are not sold prior to the closing date of the
acquisition.The Company plans to use $1000 million of the senior
term loan and the proceeds from the senior unsecured notes offering to finance,
in part, the acquisition of CHS, to refinance its existing indebtedness and
repay CHSs existing indebtedness, for general corporate purposes and to pay
related fees and expenses.The $500 million revolver is expected to
be undrawn at closing.The specific interest rates of the senior term
loan and notes is subject to final pricing andthe Company expects the
interest to reflect market rates relative to its credit ratings.See
Note 14 Subsequent Events for additional information about the proposed
acquisition of CHS.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Legal
Proceedings
On
February14, 2005, a complaint was filed in the Alabama Circuit Court for
Barbour County, captioned Eufaula Drugs, Inc.v.
ScriptSolutions [sic], one of approximately fourteen substantially
identical complaints commenced in Alabama courts against various unrelated
pharmacy benefit management companies. On April8, 2005, the plaintiff
filed an amended complaint substituting BioScrip PBM Services f/k/a
ScripSolutions PBM Services as the defendant, seeking unspecified money
damages and injunctive relief, and alleging breach of contract and related tort
and equitable claims on behalf of a putative nationwide class of pharmacies
alleging insufficient reimbursement for prescriptions dispensed by
ScripSolutions, principally on the theory that PBM Services was obligated to
update its prescription pricing files on a daily rather than weekly basis.
Following preliminary proceedings and class discovery, the parties reached a
settlement agreement on August 6, 2009, in which the Company continues to deny
liability, with a class of pharmacies which was certified solely for settlement
purposes, and class members were entitled to receive $0065 for each branded
prescription filled during the settlement class period.The court
approved the settlement on November 4, 2009 and a final judgment dismissing the
action has been entered in the action, the time to appeal which has
expired.The costs of the settlement are covered by
insurance.
The
sellers of a company, Northland Pharmacy, to Chronimed Holdings, Inc., now
known as BioScrip Pharmacy, Inc. one of BioScrips subsidiaries, are claiming a
right to additional purchase price of at least $564 million in connection with
an earn out provision in the stock purchase agreement regarding the
acquisition.The sellers, named DiCello, first sued in federal court
in Ohio in July 2007, but the court stayed the case and directed arbitration of
the disagreement by the accounting firm KPMG, LLP, as the stock purchase
agreement provides.BioScrip Pharmacy denies owing the sellers any
additional purchase price.The parties have made extensive filings as
directed by the arbitrator and are waiting for either the arbitrators decision
or instructions as to further proceedings in the matter.The Company
is confident in its position and does not believe an adverse ruling is likely;
however, there can be no assurance that an adverse ruling will not be
rendered.If the arbitrator rules in favor of DiCello, such ruling
could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, operations, or
financial position.
Government
Regulation
Various
Federal and state laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry do or
may impact the Companys current and planned operations, including, without
limitation, Federal and state laws prohibiting kickbacks in government health
programs, Federal and state antitrust and drug distribution laws, and a wide
variety of consumer protection, insurance and other state laws and regulations.
While management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance with all
existing laws and regulations material to the operation of its business, such
laws and regulations are subject to rapid change and often are uncertain in
their application. As controversies continue to arise in the healthcare industry
for example, regarding the efforts of Plan Sponsors and pharmacy benefit
managers to limit formularies, alter drug choice and establish limited networks
of participating pharmacies, Federal and state regulation and enforcement
priorities in this area can be expected to increase, the impact of which on the
Company cannot be predicted. There can be no assurance that the Company will not
be subject to scrutiny or challenge under one or more of these laws or that any
such challenge would not be successful. Any such challenge, whether or not
successful, could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. Violation of the Federal
anti-kickback statute, for example, may result in substantial criminal
penalties, as well as suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Further, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
obtain or maintain any of the regulatory approvals that may be required to
operate its business, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash
flows.
Operating
Leases
The
Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under various operating
leases with third parties. Facility lease terms are generally five years, the
majority containing options to extend for periods ranging from one to five
years. Approximately 80% of these leases contain escalation clauses that
increase base rent payments based upon either the Consumer Price Index or an
agreed upon schedule. Equipment leases are generally for periods of three to
five years.

Security
Interest and Letters of Credit
Under the
terms of the prime vendor agreement with AmerisourceBergen Drug Company
ABDC, the Company granted ABDC a secured, first priority lien in all of its
inventory as well as the proceeds thereof.In the ordinary course of
business, the Company obtained certain letters of credit LC from commercial
banks in favor of various parties.At December 31, 2009 there was
$11 million on deposit as collateral for these LCs.
Purchase
Commitments
As of
December 31, 2009, the Company had commitments to purchase prescription drugs
from drug manufacturers of approximately $177 million in 2010.These
purchase commitments are made at levels expected to be used in the normal course
of business.

The
Company continually assesses the ability to realize the benefit of its deferred
tax assets.In the fourth quarter of 2006 a valuation allowance on
deferred tax assets was recorded.During the fourth quarter of 2009,
based upon an evaluation of the positive and negative evidence, the Company
concluded that the valuation allowance in the amount of $448 million was no
longer required.As part of its analysis, the Company evaluated,
among other factors, its recent history of generating taxable income, the
underlying factors which resulted in the goodwill impairment charge that was
incurred during the fourth quarter of 2008, and its near-term forecasts of
future taxable income.After considering these factors, the Company
concluded that a reversal of the valuation allowance was
appropriate.Accordingly, the Company recognized a tax benefit of
$448 million during the 2009 fourth quarter.
At
December31, 2009, the Company had Federal net operating loss NOL
carryforwards of approximately $180million, of which $32million is
subject to an annual limitation, all of which will begin expiring in 2012 and
later.Of the Companys $180 million Federal NOLs, $85 million will
be recorded in additional paid-in capital when realized.These NOLs
are related to the exercise of non-qualified stock options.The
Company has post apportioned state NOL carryforwards remaining of approximately
$81million, the majority of which will begin expiring in 2017 and
later.

The
Company policy for recording interest and penalties associated with uncertain
tax positions is to record such items as a component of income tax expense in
the statement of operations.As of December 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008, the Company had approximately $05 million and $05 millionof
accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions, respectively.
The
Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with
Federal, state and local jurisdictions.The Company uncertain tax
positions are related to tax years that remain subject to
examination.As of December 31, 2009, U.S. tax returns for 2006,
2007, 2008 and 2009 remain subject to examination by Federal tax
authorities.Tax returns for the years 2005 through 2009 remain
subject to examination by state and local tax authorities for a majority of the
Company state and local filings.
During
January 2008, the Company settled certain controversies with taxing
authorities.The settlement called for payment of $63,000 of tax and
interest.The remaining amount of $03 million of unrecognized tax
benefits and interest for this tax position was reversed during first quarter
2008 through goodwill.
NOTE10
TREASURY STOCK
On
February27, 2003, the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors the
Board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to
repurchase up to an aggregate of $100million of its common stock in open
market or private transactions. No stock was repurchased during 2009, 2008 or
2007; however, during 2009, 2008 and 2007, 33,552; 187,544 and 189,492 shares,
respectively, were surrendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the
vesting of restricted stock awards. As of December31, 2009, approximately
$49million of the $100million authorized remains available for
additional share repurchases. The Company holds a total of 2,647,613shares
of treasury stock acquired under current and prior repurchase programs as well
as forfeitures to satisfy tax obligations in the vesting of restricted stock
awards.
NOTE11
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Under the
Companys 2008 Equity Incentive Plan the 2008 Plan the Company may issue,
among other things, incentive stock options ISOs, non-qualified stock
options NQSOs, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and performance
units to employees and directors.Under the 2008 Plan, 3,580,000
shares were authorized for issuance subject to adjustment for grants made under
the Companys 2001 Incentive Stock Plan the 2001 Plan after January 1, 2008,
as well as for forfeitures, expirations or awards that under the 2001 Plan
otherwise settled in cash after the adoption thereof.As of December
31, 2009 209,253 shares remained available for grant under the 2008
Plan.Upon effectiveness of the 2008 Plan in April 2008, the Company
ceased making grants under the 2001 Plan.The 2008 Plan and the 2001
Plan are administered by the Companys Management Development and Compensation
Committee the Compensation Committee, a standing committee of the
Board.
Under the
terms of the 2008 Plan and the 2001 Plan, plan participants may use shares to
cover tax withholding on income earned as a result of appreciation of
equity-based instruments upon exercise, vesting and/or lapsing of restrictions
thereon.Upon the exercise of stock options and the vesting of other
equity awards granted under the Plans, participants will generally have taxable
income subject to statutory withholding requirements.The number of
shares that may be issued to participants upon the exercise of stock options and
the vesting of equity awards may be reduced by the number of shares having a
market value equal to the amount of tax required to be withheld by the Company
to satisfy Federal, state and local tax obligations as a result of such exercise
or vesting.

As of
December 31, 2009 there was $31 million of unrecognized compensation expense
related to unvested option grants.That expense is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 20 years.
As
compensation expense for options granted is recorded over the requisite service
period of options, future stock-based compensation expense may be greater as
additional options are granted.
Restricted
Stock
Under the
2008 Plan, stock grants subject solely to an employees or directors continued
service with the Company will not become fully vested less than a three years
from the date of grant to employees and, in certain instances, may fully vest
upon a change in control of the Company, and b one year from the date of grant
for directors.Stock grants subject to the achievement of performance
conditions will not vest less than one year from the date of grant where the
vesting of stock grants is subject to performance measures.Such
performance shares may vest after one year from grant.No such time
restrictions applied to stock grants made under the Companys prior equity
compensation plans.
The
Company recognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards of
$12 million, $17 million and $11 million for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Since the
Company records compensation expense for restricted stock awards based on the
vesting requirements, which generally includes time elapsed, market conditions
and/or performance conditions, the weighted average period over which the
expense is recognized varies. Also, future equity-based compensation expense may
be greater if additional restricted stock awards are made.

satisfied, the Company would pay the key employee an amount in cash equal to the
value of each performance unit at the time of payment. In no event may a key
employee receive an amount in excess of $10 million with respect to performance
units for any given year. To date, no performance units have been granted under
the 2008 Plan.

Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we evaluated the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls. This evaluation was
performed under the supervision and with the participation of management
including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer
CFO. Disclosure controls are controls and procedures as defined in the
Exchange Act Rules13d-15e and 15d-15e designed to reasonably assure
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the
Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.
Disclosure controls are also designed to reasonably assure that such information
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
The
evaluation of our disclosure controls included a review of the controls
objectives and design, our implementation of the controls and the effect of the
controls on the information generated for use in this Annual Report. Based upon
the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure
controls as of December31, 2009 were effective.
Management
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, and effected
by our Board, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that:
Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the Companys financial
transactions;
Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that our revenues and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors; and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have
a material effect on our financial
statements.
Management
assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2009, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements
assessment included an evaluation of such elements as the design and operating
effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation,
accounting policies, and our overall control environment.
Based on
managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting our
management believes that as of December31, 2009, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective.Our independent registered public
accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on
the Companys internal control over financial reporting which is included
herein.
Inherent
Limitations on Control Systems
Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, will be or have been detected. These inherent limitations include the
realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more
people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,
control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, there was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders
BioScrip,
Inc.
We have
audited BioScrip, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. BioScrip, Inc.s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our
opinion, BioScrip, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based onthe COSO criteria.
We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of BioScrip,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of BioScrip, Inc.
and our report dated March 2, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
