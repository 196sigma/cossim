Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated balance sheets as of January1, 2005 and January3, 2004 and the consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended January1, 2005, together with the related notes and the
report of our independent auditors, are on the following pages. Additional required financial
information is described in Item14. 42 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IRIDEX Corporation In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IRIDEX Corporation and
its subsidiaries at January1, 2005 and January3, 2004, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January1, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under a2
presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP San Jose, California

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Business of the Company Description of Business IRIDEX Corporation is a worldwide provider of semiconductor-based laser systems used to treat
eye diseases in ophthalmology and skin lesions in dermatology. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Financial Statement Presentation The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company invests primarily in money market
funds and government paper which are subject to minimal credit risk. Available-for-Sale Securities All marketable securities as of January1, 2005 and January3, 2004 are considered to be
available-for-sale and therefore are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale securities are
classified as current assets when they have scheduled maturities of less than one year.
Available-for-sale securities are classified as non current assets when they have scheduled
maturities of more than one year. Marketable securities include auction rate and floating rate
securities. These securities are structured as short-term, highly liquid investments that can be
readily converted into cash every 30, 60 or 90days. However, since the stated or contractual
maturities of these securities is greater than 90days, these securities are classified as
marketable securities and not cash equivalents. Unrealized holding gains and losses on such
securities are reported net of related taxes as a separate component of stockholders equity until
realized. Realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in interest and
other income and are computed using the specific identification cost method. Sales Returns Allowance and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts In the process of preparing financial statements we must make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reported period. Specifically, we must estimate future product returns related to current period
product revenue. We analyze historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer
demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance
and other allowances. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in
connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period.
Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if
management made different judgments or utilized different estimates. The provision for sales
returns amounted to $02million in 2005. Similarly our management must make estimates of the
uncollectibility of our accounts receivable. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable
and 49 Table of Contents analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current
economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts. Our accounts receivable balance was $74million, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts of $05million as of January1, 2005. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a standard cost
basis which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out FIFOmethod. Lower of cost or
market is evaluated by considering obsolescence, excessive levels of inventory, deterioration and
other factors. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if
required, are made for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing
these adjustments include changes in demand, product life cycle and development plans, component
cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these
adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which is generally three years. Amortization of leasehold improvements and property and equipment
is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
lease duration or the estimated useful life of the related assets,
typically three years. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment
provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the
receivables is reasonably assured.
Shipments are generally made with Free-On-Board FOBshipping point terms, whereby title passes
upon shipment from our dock. Any shipments with FOB receiving point terms are recorded as revenue
when the shipment arrives at the receiving point. Up-front fees received in connection with
product sales are deferred and recognized over the associated product shipments. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue related to warranty contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the
period of the applicable contract. Cost is recognized as incurred. A reconciliation of the
changes in the Companys deferred revenue balances for the years ending January3, 2004 and January

Research and Development Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Advertising We expense advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expenses for 2004, 2003 and
2002 were $218,000, $311,000 and $242,000, respectively. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Carrying amounts of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short
maturities. Estimated fair values for available-for-sale securities, which are separately
disclosed elsewhere, are based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments. Income Taxes Deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. 51 Table of Contents Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No123. Under APB 25, compensation expense for grants to employees is based on the difference, if any,
on the date of the grant, between the fair value of the Companys stock and the options exercise
price. SFAS 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or
similar equity investment. The pro forma disclosure of the difference between compensation expense
included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method is presented below. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income lossto pro forma net loss as if

52 Table of Contents The weighted average expected life was calculated based on the exercise behavior of each
group. Group A represents officers and directors who are a smaller group holding a greater average
number of options than other option holders and who tend to exercise later in the vesting period.
Group B are all other option holders, virtually all of whom are employees. This group tends to
exercise earlier in the vesting period. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of those options granted in 2004, 2003
and 2002 was $489, $296 and $248, respectively. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods and
Services, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No123. Stock-based compensation expense related to
stock options granted to non-employees is recognized on a straight line basis as the stock options
are earned. The stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate as the deemed fair market value of
the common stock fluctuates. There were no equity instruments issued to non-employees in 2004,
2003 and 2002. We have also estimated the fair value for the purchase rights issued under our 1995 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan, under the Black-Scholes valuation model using the following assumptions for
2004, 2003 and 2002

The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of those purchase rights granted in
2004, 2003 and 2002 was $137, $101 and $131, respectively. Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties Our cash and cash equivalents are deposited in demand and money market accounts of three
financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on
such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore, bear minimal
risk. We market our products to distributors and end-users throughout the world. Sales to
international distributors are generally made on open credit terms and letter of credit. Management
performs ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintains an allowance for potential
credit losses. Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses related to individual
customers or group of customers in any particular geographic area. For the years ended January1,
2005, January3, 2004 and December28, 2002 no customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenue.
As of January1, 2005 and January3, 2004 no customers accounted for more than 10% of accounts
receivable. Our products require approvals from the Food and Drug Administration and international
regulatory agencies prior to commercialized sales. Our future products may not receive required
approvals. If we were denied such approvals, or if such approvals were delayed, it would have a
materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 53 Table of Contents Reliance on Certain Suppliers Certain components and services used by the Company to manufacture and develop its products
are presently available from only one or a limited number of suppliers or vendors. The loss of any
of these suppliers or vendors would potentially require a significant level of hardware and/or
software development to incorporate the products or services into the Companys products. Use of Estimates In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management utilizes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expense during the reporting period. The primary estimates underlying the Companys financial
statements include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, reserves for obsolete and slow
moving inventory, product warranty, income taxes and accrual for other liabilities. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Fiscal Year Our fiscal year covers a 52 or 53week period and ends on the Saturday nearest December31.
Fiscal year 2004 and 2002 included 52weeks. Fiscal year 2003 included 53weeks. Net Income lossper Share Basic and diluted net income lossper share are computed by dividing net income lossfor
the year by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
The calculation of diluted net income lossper share excludes potential common stock if their
effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock consists of incremental common shares issuable
upon the exercise of stock options. See Note 6. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No151,
Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4. SFAS No151 clarifies the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No.
151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning in the second quarter
of fiscal 2006. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No151 will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment, which replaced SFAS No.
123 and superseded APB 25. SFAS No123R addresses the accounting for share-based payment
transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity
instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company s equity
instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Under SFAS No123R,
companies will no longer be able to account for share-based compensation transactions using the
intrinsic method in accordance with APB 25 but will be required to account for such transactions
using a fair-value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of earnings. SFAS
No123R is effective beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and allows, but does not
require, companies to restate the full fiscal year of adoption to reflect the impact of expensing
share-based payments under SFAS No123R. The Company has not yet determined which fair-value
method and transitional provision it will follow. The pro forma impact on the Companys 54 Table of Contents financial statements of applying Black-Scholes option valuation method of accounting for stock
options is disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Balance Sheet Detail Available-for-sale securities in thousands

55 Table of Contents 4. Bank Borrowings We
have a revolving line of credit agreement with a bank expiring on October5, 2006, which
provides for borrowings of up to $40million at the banks prime rate 525% at January1, 2005.
The agreement contains restrictive covenants including prohibiting payment of dividends without the
banks prior consent. There were no borrowings against the credit line at January1, 2005. 5. Commitments and Contingencies Lease Agreements We lease our operating facilities under a noncancelable operating lease. In September2003,
we entered into a lease amendment for our facility in Mountain View. The original lease term of
this facility, which ended in February2004, was amended and extended until February2009. The
lease was also amended to grant us an option to renew this lease for an additional five year period
beginning 2009 until 2014 at a base monthly rental amount to be negotiated at the time of the
renewal. Rent expense, net of sublease income, totaled $403,000, $606,000 and $642,000 for the
years ended January1, 2005, January3, 2004 and December28, 2002 respectively. Future minimum lease payments under current operating leases at January1, 2005 are summarized
as follows in thousands

License Agreements The Company is obligated to pay royalties equivalent to 5% and 75% of sales on certain
products under license agreements. Royalty expense was $80,000, $93,000 and $105,000 for the years
ended January1, 2005, January3, 2004 and December28, 2002, respectively. Contingencies From time to time, the Company may be engaged in certain administrative proceedings,
incidental to its normal business activities. Management believes that liabilities resulting from
such proceedings, or claims which are pending or known to be threatened, are adequately covered by
liability insurance and will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position
or results of operations. The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in our ordinary course of
business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to
reimburse the indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party,
generally our business partners or customers, in connection with any trade secret, copyright,
patent or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our
products. The term of these indemnification agreements is generally perpetual anytime after the
execution of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be
required to make under these agreements is not 56 Table of Contents determinable. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related
to these indemnification agreements. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of
these agreements is minimal. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that
may require the Company: to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise
by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from
willful misconduct of a culpable nature; to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any
proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified; and to make good faith determination
whether or not it is practicable for the Company to obtain directors and officers insurance. The
Company currently has directors and officers insurance. 6. Stockholders Equity Convertible Preferred Stock Our Articles of Incorporation authorize 2,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock.
Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. As of January1, 2005, we
had no preferred stock issued and outstanding. Treasury Stock In December1998, we instituted a stock repurchase program whereby up to 150,000 shares of our
Common Stock may be repurchased in the open market. We plan to utilize all of the reacquired
shares for reissuance in connection with our employee stock programs. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, no
shares of Common Stock were repurchased. As of January1, 2005 we have repurchased 103,000 shares
of common stock. Stock Option Plans Amended and Restated 1989 Incentive Stock Plan The Amended and Restated 1989 Plan the 1989 Plan provided for the grant of options and
stock purchase rights to purchase shares of our Common Stock to employees and consultants. The
terms of the 1989 Plan, which expired in August1999, are substantially the same as the 1998 Plan
described below. 1998 Stock Plan The 1998 Stock Plan the 1998 Plan provides for the granting to employees including
officers and employee directors of incentive stock options and for the granting to employees
including officers and employee directors and consultants of nonstatutory stock options and stock
purchase rights SPRs. The exercise price of incentive stock options and SPRs granted under the
1998 Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the shares at the time of grant. With
respect to any recipient who owns stock possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our
outstanding capital stock, the exercise price of any option or SPR granted must be at least equal
to 110% of the fair market value at the time of grant. Options granted under the 1998 Plan are
exercisable at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator; generally
over a four year period. The maximum term of incentive stock options granted to any recipient must
not exceed ten years; provided, however, that the maximum term of an incentive stock option granted
to any recipient possessing more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock must
not exceed five years. In the case of SPRs, unless the Administrator determines otherwise, we have
a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchasers
employment with us for any 57 Table of Contents reason including death or disability. Such repurchase option lapses at a rate determined by
the Administrator. The purchase price for shares repurchased by us is the original price paid by
the purchaser. As of January3, 2004 and December28, 2002 no shares were subject to repurchase.
The form of consideration for exercising an option or stock purchase right, including the method of
payment, is determined by the Administrator. The 1998 Plan expires in June2008. 1995 Director Option Plan In October1995, we adopted the 1995 Director Option Plan the Director Plan, under which
members of the Board of Directors are granted options to purchase 11,250 shares upon the first to
occur of their appointment or the adoption of the Director Plan First Option and an option to
purchase 3,750 shares Subsequent Option on July 1 of each year thereafter provided that he or
she has served on the Board for at least the preceding six months. The options granted are at fair
market value on the date of grant. The First Option becomes exercisable as to one-twelfth 1/12
of the shares subject to the First Option for each quarter over a three-year period. Each
Subsequent Option becomes exercisable as to one-fourth 1/4 of the shares subject to the
Subsequent Option for each quarter, commencing one quarter after the First Option and any
previously granted Subsequent Options have become fully exercisable. Options granted under the
Director Plan have a term of 10years. In the event of our merger with or into another corporation, resulting in a change of control,
or the sale of substantially all of our assets, each Director Plan options become exercisable in
full and shall be exercisable for 30days after written notice to the holder of the event causing
the change in control. Unless terminated sooner, the Director Plan will terminate in 2005. The Board has authority to
amend or terminate the Director Plan, provided no such amendment may impair the rights of any
optionee without the optionees consent. 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Our 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of
Directors in October1995. The total number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
the Purchase Plan at January1, 2005 was 55,450. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees
including officers and employee directors to purchase Common Stock through payroll deductions,
which may not exceed 10% of an employees compensation. No employee may purchase more than $25,000
worth of stock in any calendar year or more than 1,000 shares of
Common Stock in any six-month
period. The price of shares purchased under the Purchase Plan is 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of the Common Stock at the beginning of the offering period or the end of the offering
period. The Purchase Plan will terminate in 2005, unless terminated sooner by the Board of
Directors. 58 Table of Contents Information with respect to activity under these option plans are set forth below in

benefits through the deferred salary deductions for substantially all employees. Employees may
contribute up to 15% of their annual compensation to the plan, limited to a maximum amount set by
the Internal Revenue Service. The plan also provides for Company contributions at the discretion of
the Board of Directors. On April1, 2000 the Company commenced a Company match for the 401k in
the amount of 50% of employee contributions up to an annual maximum of $1,000 per year. The
Company contributions totaled $88,000 in 2004, $89,000 in 2003 and $98,000 in 2002. 8. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes

In 2004, there were 463,588 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of
$865 that were not included in the computation of dilutive net loss per common share because their
effect was antidilutive. In 2003 and 2002, there were 791,406 and 1,296,391, outstanding options
to purchase shares, respectively, at weighted average exercise prices of $699 and $597 per
share, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted net income lossper
common share since, in each case, the exercise price of the options exceeded the market price of
the common stock. These options could dilute earnings per share in future periods. 11. Selected Quarterly Financial Data, Unaudited
