56 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pixelworks, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pixelworks, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and comprehensive income lossand cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Pixelworks, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for share-based payment awards effective January1, 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Pixelworks, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO,
and our report dated March12, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of,
and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Portland, Oregon

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents PIXELWORKS, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In thousands, except share and per share data NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION Nature of Business Pixelworks, Inc. Pixelworks or the
Company is an innovative designer, developer and marketer
of semiconductors and software that specializes in video and pixel processing for the advanced
display industry, primarily advanced televisions, digital projectors and liquid crystal displays.
Our flexible design architecture enables our technology to produce high image quality in our
customers display products in a range of solutions including system-on-chips integrated circuits
ICs and co-processor ICs. We are headquartered in Tualatin, Oregon, with
design centers in Shanghai, China and San Jose, California. Consolidated Financial Statements Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pixelworks and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All foreign
subsidiaries use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency, and as a result, transaction gains and
losses are included in the statement of operations. Transaction gains losseswere $151, $258
and $77 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant estimates and
judgments include those related to product returns, warranty obligations, bad debts, inventory
valuation, property and equipment, valuation of share-based payments, intangible assets, income
taxes, litigation and other contingencies. The actual results experienced could differ materially
from our estimates. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements to
conform to the 2006 presentation. NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents totaled $59,516 and $62,221 at December
31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Marketable Securities Our investments in marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities SFAS 115. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value
based on quoted market prices with unrealized holding gains or losses, net of tax, included in
accumulated other 62 Table of Contents comprehensive income, a component of shareholders equity. The cost of
securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their cost are
other-than-temporary. This evaluation includes qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the
severity and duration of the unrealized loss, as well as our ability and intent to hold the
investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Short- and long-term marketable debt securities have remaining maturities of twelve months or less
and greater than twelve months, respectively, at December31, 2006 and 2005. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amount and do not bear interest when recorded or
accrue interest when past due. We do not have any off balance sheet exposure risk related to
customers. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. The balance is determined based on our
historical write-off experience and the age of outstanding receivables at each reporting date. The
determination to write-off specific accounts receivable balances is made based on likelihood of
collection and past due status. Past due status is based on invoice date and terms specific to
each customer. Inventories Inventories consist of finished goods and work-in-process, and are stated at the lower of standard
cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market net realizable
value, net of a reserve for slow-moving and obsolete items. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of the assets as follows   
Software
Lesser of 3years or contractual license term   Equipment, furniture and fixtures
2years   Tooling
2years   Leasehold improvements
Lessor of lease term or estimated useful life Reviews for impairment of property and equipment are performed whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable, or that the useful life of
assets is shorter than originally estimated. Impairment is assessed in accordance with SFAS 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets SFAS 144, by comparing the
projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the assets over their remaining useful lives
against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. During the year ended December31, 2006, we
wrote off property and equipment of $2,331 in connection with our restructuring efforts. See Note
6. The cost of property and equipment repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred. 63 Table of Contents Acquired Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets consist of developed technology, customer relationships and trademark
assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives
as follows: developed technology, five to seven years; customer relationships, three years; and
trademark, one year. Intangible assets are reviewed regularly to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, or that the useful life of an asset is
shorter than originally estimated. If such events or circumstances exist, the assets are assessed
for recoverability in accordance with SFAS 144. During the year ended December31, 2006, we
recorded impairment losses on acquired intangible assets of $23,083. See Note 4. Licensed Technology We have capitalized licensed technology assets in other long-term assets. These assets are stated
at cost and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license or the estimated
life of the asset, if the license is not contractually limited, which is generally three to five
years. These assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with SFAS 144 whenever events or
circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, or that their useful
lives may be shorter than originally estimated. During the year ended December31, 2006, we wrote
off capitalized licensed technology of $9,223 in connection with our restructuring efforts. See
Note 6. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business
combinations. Goodwill is not amortized and is instead tested annually for impairment and more
frequently if events and circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. The impairment tests are
performed in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Accordingly, an
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level. We assigned all
goodwill to a single, enterprise-level reporting unit. The impairment test consists of two steps.
First, we determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is then compared to its
carrying amount. Second, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units
goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is
determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase
price allocation in accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations. The residual fair value after
this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. We perform our annual
goodwill impairment test on January 1st of each year. During the year ended December
31, 2006, we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $133,739. See Note 4. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue
Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue from product sales to customers and distributors
upon shipment provided that   
an authorized purchase order has been received   
title and risk of loss have transferred   
the sales price is fixed or determinable; and   
collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. 64 Table of Contents There are no customer acceptance provisions associated with our products, and except for
replacement of defective products under our warranty program discussed below, we have no obligation
to accept product returns from end customers. However, we have accepted returns on a case-by-case
basis as customer accommodations in the past. As a result, we provide for estimated reductions to
gross profit for these sales returns in our reserve for sales returns and allowances. At the end
of each reporting period, we estimate the reserve based on historical experience and knowledge of
any applicable events or transactions. The reserve is included in accrued liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet. A portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements that grant the distributor limited
stock rotation rights and price protection on in-stock inventory. The stock rotation rights allow
these distributors to exchange a limited amount of their in-stock inventory for other Pixelworks
product. We analyze historical stock rotations at the end of each reporting period. To date,
returns under the stock rotation provisions have been nominal. As a result, we have not recorded a
reserve for stock rotations. Under the price protection provisions, we grant distributors credit if they purchased product for a
specific customer and we subsequently lower the price to the customer such that the distributor can
no longer earn its negotiated margin on in-stock inventory. At the end of each reporting period,
we estimate a reserve for price protection credits based on historical experience and knowledge of
any applicable events or transactions. The reserve for price protection is in included in our
reserve for sales returns and allowances, which is included in accrued liabilities in our
consolidated balance sheet. Warranty Program We warrant that our products will be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of
twelve months from delivery. Warranty repairs are guaranteed for the remainder of the original
warranty period. Our warranty is limited to repairing or replacing products, or refunding the
purchase price. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate a reserve for warranty returns
based on historical experience and knowledge of any applicable events or transactions. While we
engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, which include actively monitoring and
evaluating the quality of our suppliers, should actual product failure rates or product replacement
costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required.
The reserve for warranty returns is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheet. Stock-Based Compensation On January1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment
awards, including stock options, based on the estimated fair value of the awards. Under SFAS 123R,
the fair value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
expense over the requisite service period. In March2005, the SEC issued SAB No107 relating to
SFAS 123R, which we have applied in our adoption of SFAS 123R. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, we
elected to attribute the value of stock-based compensation to expense on the straight-line basis. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors
using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 as allowed under SFAS 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, stock-based compensation
was measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Pixelworks common stock on the
date of grant, or other measurement date, over the amount that the option holder had to pay to
acquire the stock. We used the modified prospective transition method in adopting SFAS 123R. Our consolidated
financial statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS
123R, and the 65 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to
reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS 123R. Research and Development Research and development activities are charged to expense as incurred. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. This approach requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish a valuation
allowance in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109, to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amount expected more likely than not to be realized in future tax returns. Tax contingency reserves are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we
have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities. These potential exposures result from
the varying applications of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations. Our tax contingency
reserves contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by
taxing jurisdictions. The ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the
amount we have accrued. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for the reporting of comprehensive
income lossand its components. Unrealized holding gain loss, net of tax, related to our
available-for-sale investments was $142, $4,034 and $531 for the years ended December31, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of the following

Leases We lease office space and equipment and classify our leases as either operating or capital lease
arrangements in accordance with the criteria of SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases. Certain of our
office space operating leases contain provisions under which monthly rent escalates over time and
certain leases may also contain provisions for reimbursement of a specified amount of leasehold
improvements. When lease agreements contain escalating rent clauses, we straight-line rent expense
over the term of the lease. When lease agreements provide allowances for leasehold improvements,
we capitalize the leasehold improvement assets and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the
lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset, and reduce rent expense on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease by the amount of the asset capitalized. 66 Table of Contents Fair Value of Financial Instruments The fair value of our monetary assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximates the carrying value
due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of our long-term debt was
$98,140 as of December31, 2006, as compared to its carrying value of $140,000. The fair value of
long-term debt was based on the quoted market price of the debt. Risks and Uncertainties Concentration of Suppliers We do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility and do not have the resources to
manufacture our products internally. We rely on four third-party foundries to produce all of our
products and we do not have any long-term agreements with any of these suppliers. In light of
these dependencies, it is reasonably possible that failure to perform by one of these suppliers
could have a severe impact on our results of operations. Risk of Technological Change The markets in which we compete, or seek to compete, are subject to rapid technological change,
frequent new product introductions, changing customer requirements for new products and features
and evolving industry standards. The introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new
industry standards could render our products less desirable or obsolete, which could harm our
business. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash
equivalents, short- and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. We limit our
exposure to credit risk associated with cash equivalent and marketable security balances by placing
our funds in various high-quality securities and limiting concentrations of issuers and maturity
dates. We limit our exposure to credit risk associated with accounts receivable by carefully
evaluating creditworthiness before offering terms to customers. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB
108, which provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in
quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The purpose of
SAB 108 is to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statements misstatements and
the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet.
SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November15, 2006 and, accordingly, we adopted
SAB 108 on December31, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated statements of financial position or results of operations. In September2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans SFAS 158. SFAS 158 requires a an employer to recognize the overfunded or
underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its
statement of financial position, b to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which
the changes occur through comprehensive income, c to measure the funded status of a plan as of the
date of its year-end 67 Table of Contents statement of financial position, with limited exceptions, and d disclose in
the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic
benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses,
prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. An employer with publicly
traded equity securities is required to adopt SFAS 158 as of the end of the fiscal year ending
after December15, 2006, with the exception of the measurement of the funded status of the plan as
of the date of the employers year-end statement of financial position. The requirement to measure
plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employers fiscal year end statement of
financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008, with earlier
application encouraged. Retrospective application of SFAS 158 is not permitted. Accordingly, we
adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS 158 on December31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 158
resulted in an initial adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $48, net of tax of
$16, which is included in the statement of shareholders equity. NOTE 3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement operations for the year
ended December31, 2006 includes 1 compensation expense of $8,203 for share-based payment awards
granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of December31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of SFAS 123 and 2 compensation expense of
$1,353 for share-based payment awards granted subsequent to December31, 2005 based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. For the year ended
December31, 2006, loss before income taxes and net loss would have been lower by $9,197 and basic
and diluted net loss per share would have been $404 had we continued to account for our
share-based awards to employees in accordance with APB 25. No stock-based compensation cost was capitalized as part of an asset during the year ended December
31, 2006. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. SFAS 123R requires the benefits of tax
deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options to be classified as
financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows on a prospective basis. This amount
would be shown as Excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options on the consolidated statement
of cash flows. There was no realized excess tax benefits in the year ended December31, 2006. The fair value of stock-based compensation was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model and the following weighted average assumptions

and 2004 was $189, $591 and $1132, respectively. The risk free interest rate is estimated using
an average of treasury bill interest rates. The expected dividend yield is zero as we have not
paid any dividends to date and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. The expected term is
estimated using expected and historical exercise behavior. The expected volatility is estimated
using historical calculated volatility and considers factors such as future events or circumstances
that could impact volatility. Had we accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123 prior to January1, 2006,
our net loss would have approximated the following pro-forma amounts

As of December31, 2006, we determined that gross unrealized losses on our marketable securities
were temporary based on the duration of the unrealized losses. As of December31, 2006, the
unrealized loss for securities in an unrealized loss position for more than one year was $3,629,
which consists primarily of our equity security with an unrealized loss of $3,560. 70 Table of Contents During the year ended December31, 2005, we had sales of marketable securities prior to maturity of
$102,576, which is included in proceeds from the sales or maturities of available-for-sale
marketable securities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. We did not have any sales of
marketable securities prior to maturity during the years ended December31, 2006 or 2004. Maturities of long-term marketable securities range from one to three years at December31, 2006. Accounts Receivable, Net Accounts receivable, net consists of the following

During the year ended December31, 2006, we recorded increased provisions for slow-moving and
obsolete inventory primarily due to regulations imposed by the European Unions Restriction of
Hazardous 71 Table of Contents Substance Directive. This directive prevents us from selling parts containing specific
hazardous substances such as lead to certain of our customers. Additionally, lower revenue and
increased lower of cost or market reserves on certain parts contributed to the increase in our
reserve for slow-moving and obsolete inventory. While we do not currently expect to be able to sell or otherwise use the reserved inventory we have
on hand at December31, 2006 based upon our forecast and backlog, it is possible that a customer
will decide in the future to purchase a portion of the reserved inventory. It is not possible for
us to predict if or when this may happen, or how much we may sell. If such sales occur, we do not
expect that they will have a material impact on our gross profit margin. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment, net consists of the following

December31, 2006. This licensed technology was written off based on our decision not to pursue
further development of projects that incorporate the technology, and there were no alternate future

In April2006, we initiated a plan to improve our breakeven point by reducing manufacturing
overhead and operating expenses and focusing on our core business. The plan included integrating
the Internet Protocol Television IPTV technology that we acquired as a result of our
acquisition of Equator Technologies, Inc. Equator in June2005 with our advanced television
technology product development. We are no longer pursuing stand-alone digital media streaming
markets that are not core to advanced television. As a result of this change, we performed an
impairment analysis in accordance with SFAS 144 as of March31, 2006 on acquired intangible assets.
We recorded impairment losses on the developed technology, customer relationships and trademark
intangible assets acquired from Equator. The impairment losses were equal to the excess of the
carrying value over the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. Estimated fair value was
determined using the discounted cash flow method. The new cost basis of these acquired intangible
assets is being amortized over their remaining useful lives. The impairment loss of $23,083 is
included in our statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2006, of which $21,330 is
related to developed technology and is included in cost of revenue. Amortization expense was $4,689, $6,199 and $1,015 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively. Estimated future amortization expense is as follows

As the market value of our common stock fell below our book value during the second quarter of
2006, we 73 Table of Contents performed an additional goodwill impairment test on June30, 2006. As a result of this
impairment analysis, we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of $133,739 in the second quarter
of 2006. We calculated the impairment loss based on an allocation of the fair value of the
Companys equity to the fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a
purchase price allocation in a business combination. In the allocation, goodwill was determined to
have no implied fair value and as a result, the entire balance was written off. Accrued Liabilities and Current Portion of Long-Term Liabilities Accrued liabilities and current portion of long-term liabilities consists of the following

From time to time, we have acquired software and licensed technology assets under purchase
agreements that provide extended payment terms. The payment periods vary, but generally extend
over a period of one month to two years. We are obligated to make all payments accrued, and there
are no contingencies attached to any of the agreements. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the
non-current portion of these obligations is $5,563 and $12,712, respectively, and is included in
long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The December31, 2006 current portion of
$7,733 is due in 2007, and the non-current portion of $5,563 is due in 2008. 74 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the changes in our reserves for sales returns and allowances and

Long-Term Debt and Debt Issuance Costs On May18, 2004, we issued $125,000 of convertible subordinated debentures the debentures due
2024 in a private offering pursuant to Rule144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
Securities Act and outside of the United States in accordance with RegulationS under the
Securities Act. On June4, 2004, we issued an additional $25,000 of debentures pursuant to the
exercise of an option granted to the initial purchasers. The debentures have been registered with
the SEC for resale under the Securities Act. In February2006, we repurchased in the open market, and retired, $10,000 of our outstanding
debentures for $6,800 in cash. We recognized a gain through other income on the repurchase of
$3,200, which is included in our statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2006 net
of a write-off of debt issuance costs of $191. As of December31, 2006, we have outstanding
debentures in the amount of $140,000. The debentures bear interest at a rate of 175% per annum and interest is payable on May
15th and November15th of each year. Under certain circumstances, the
debentures are convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of 410627 shares of common
stock per $1 principal amount of debentures, for a total of 5,748,778 shares. This is equivalent
to a conversion price of approximately $2435 per share. The outstanding debentures are
convertible if aour stock trades above 130% of the conversion price for 20 out of 30 consecutive
trading days during any calendar quarter, bthe debentures trade at an amount less than or equal
to 98% of the if-converted value of the notes for five consecutive trading days, ca call for
redemption occurs, or din the event of certain other specified corporate transactions. We may
redeem some or all of the debentures for cash on or after May15, 2011 at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest. The holders of the
debentures have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on May15,
2011, May15, 2014 and May15, 2019 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest. The debentures are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all our
existing and future senior debt, and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future debt
of our subsidiaries. At December31, 2006, we had no senior debt outstanding and our subsidiaries
had approximately $3,640 of liabilities to which the debentures were effectively subordinated. 75 Table of Contents The debentures meet the definition of conventional convertible debt in EITF Issue No00-19,
Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Companys
Own Stock. We have evaluated each of the put, call and conversion features of the debentures and
concluded that none of these features constitute embedded derivatives under the accounting rules
that must be bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives in accordance with
SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The fees associated with the issuance of the convertible debentures included $4,500 withheld from
the proceeds and $462 paid in cash. These debt issuance costs have been capitalized and are
included in long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The debt issuance costs are being
amortized over seven years on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest rate
method. NOTE 5. EARNINGS PER SHARE We calculate earnings per share in accordance with SFAS 128, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings
per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
and include exchangeable shares. These exchangeable shares, which were issued on September6, 2002
by Jaldi, our Canadian subsidiary, to its shareholders in connection with the Jaldi asset
acquisition, have characteristics essentially equivalent to Pixelworks common stock. Diluted weighted average shares outstanding includes the increased number of common shares that
would be outstanding assuming the exercise of certain outstanding stock options and the vesting of
certain restricted stock, when such exercise or vesting would have the effect of reducing earnings
per share. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we adopted EITF Issue No04-8, The Effect of
Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share. As a result, diluted weighted average
shares outstanding for the year ended December31, 2004 includes the increased number of common
shares that would be outstanding assuming the conversion of our convertible subordinated
debentures, using the if-converted method, when such conversion would have the effect of reducing
earnings per share. The effect was antidilutive in all other periods presented. The following schedule reconciles basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the
periods presented

Weighted average outstanding stock options of 2,262,702 have been excluded from the computation of
diluted net income per share for the year ended December31, 2004 because the options exercise
prices were greater than the average market value of Pixelworks common stock, which has the effect
of making these potential shares anti-dilutive. Net loss used in the calculation of basic net loss per share was the same as net loss used in
calculating diluted net loss per share for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005. The
following schedule reconciles net income used in the calculation of basic net income per share to

NOTE 6. RESTRUCTURINGS In April2006, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve our breakeven point by reducing
manufacturing overhead and operating expenses and focusing on our core business. The plan included
integrating the IPTV technology that we acquired from Equator with our advanced television
technology product development. We are no longer pursuing other stand-alone digital media
streaming markets that are not core to advanced television. In November2006, we initiated an additional restructuring plan to further reduce operating
expenses. This additional plan includes further consolidation of our North American operations in
order to achieve reduced compensation and rent expenses, while at the same time making critical
infrastructure investments in people, process and information systems to improve our operating
efficiency. 77 Table of Contents Total restructuring expense included in our statement of operations for the year ended December31,
2006 is comprised of the following

As we continue efforts of implementing the restructuring plan announced in November2006, we expect
to incur restructuring charges of $3,500 to $4,000 over the next several quarters, consisting
primarily of costs related to termination and retention benefits and the consolidation of leased
space. In October2005, we initiated a restructuring plan to improve the effectiveness and timeliness of
our product development efforts in order to reduce our overall development costs. The
restructuring resulted in a reduction-in-force of 36 employees during the fourth quarter of 2005.
These employees were given severance benefits, which were expensed and paid in the fourth quarter
of 2005. The total amount of these benefits was approximately $1,162. As of December31, 2005, we
had a nominal amount accrued related to this restructuring, which was paid in January2006. 78 Table of Contents NOTE 7. INCOME TAXES Domestic and foreign pre-tax income lossis as follows

The current portion of the net deferred tax asset balance is $445 and $0 as of December31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current
assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The non-current portion of the net deferred tax asset
balance is $928 and $406 as of December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The non-current portion
is included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet, and is offset by a contingency
reserve of $406, which is included in income taxes payable. As of December31, 2006, we have
federal income tax receivable of approximately $1,645 included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December31, 2006, the net deferred tax asset relates primarily to foreign jurisdictions
where we have concluded it is more likely than not that we will realize the net deferred tax assets
in a future period. In addition, as of December31, 2006, we have provided for a full valuation
allowance on essentially all of our U.S. and Canadian net deferred tax assets as it is not more
likely than not that we will realize these net deferred tax assets in a future period. As of
December31, 2005, we have provided a full valuation allowance on essentially all of our net
deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that we will realize these net deferred tax
assets in a future period. The net increase decreasein the total valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2006,
2005 and 2004 was $48,337, $63,550, and $4,462, respectively. The increase in 2005 included
$38,773 which was allocated to the statement of operations and $24,777 which was added to offset
tax assets acquired from Equator for which we did not believe we could realized a benefit. SFAS
109 requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some
portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider future taxable income by
jurisdiction, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies when
making our assessment. If recognized due to the reversal of valuation allowance, certain tax benefits in the amount of
$31,298 will be allocated first to acquired intangible assets and second to the statement of
operations. 81 Table of Contents As of December31, 2006, we have federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $197,334, $99,657 and $9,423, respectively, which will expire between the years 2008
and 2026. As of December31, 2006, we have available federal, state and foreign research and
experimentation tax credit carryforwards of approximately $14,623, $6,562 and $4,524, respectively,
which began expiring in 2006. Utilization of a portion of the U.S. net operating loss and credit
carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. An ownership change subject to these
provisions occurred with the acquisitions of nDSP in 2002 and Equator in 2005. The net operating
loss carryforwards acquired from Equator in the amount of approximately $159,000 federal and
$56,000 state may not be realizable due to tax regulations relating to changes in the business
activities of the acquired entity. We had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately $5,653 as of December31,
2006, for which deferred taxes have not been provided. Such earnings are considered indefinitely
invested outside of the United States. If repatriated, some of these earnings could generate
foreign tax credits that may reduce the federal tax liability associated with any future foreign
dividend. We have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving positions that could be
challenged by taxing authorities. The tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant and
adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes. While we
believe we have adequately provided for potential exposures, the ultimate resolution of these
matters may be greater or less than the amount we have accrued. NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Royalties We license technology from third parties and have agreed to pay certain suppliers a per unit
royalty based on either the number of chips sold or manufactured, or the net sales price of the
chips containing the licensed technology. Royalty expense was $2,767, $3,056 and $2,493 for the
years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which is included in cost of revenue in
the consolidated statements of operations. 401k Plan We have a profit-sharing plan for eligible employees under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code
Section401k. Participants may defer a percentage of their annual compensation on a pre-tax
basis, not to exceed the dollar limit that is set by law. A discretionary matching contribution by
the Company is allowed and is equal to a uniform percentage of the amount of salary reduction
elected to be deferred, which percentage will be determined each year by the Company. The Company
made no contributions to the 401k plan during 2006, 2005 or 2004. 82 Table of Contents Leases At December31, 2006, future minimum payments under operating leases are as follows

2006, 2005 and 2004 was $4,437, $4,381 and $2,942, respectively. Contract Manufacturers In the normal course of business, we commit to purchase products from our contract manufacturers to
be delivered within the next 90days. In certain situations, should we cancel an order, we could
be required to pay cancellation fees. Such obligations could impact our immediate results of
operations but would not materially affect our business. Indemnifications Certain of our agreements include limited indemnification provisions for claims from third-parties
relating to our intellectual property. Such indemnification provisions are accounted for in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Summary of Interpretation No45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others-an interpretation of FASB Statements No5, 57, and 107 and rescission of
FASB Interpretation No. 34. The indemnification is limited to the amount paid by the customer. As
of December31, 2006, we have not incurred any material liabilities arising from these
indemnification obligations. However, in the future such obligations could immediately impact our
results of operations but are not expected to materially affect our business. Legal Proceedings We are subject to legal matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our
business. Although we currently believe that resolving such matters, individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of
operations, or our cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of
these matters may change in the future. In the fourth quarter of 2006, our claim against funds placed in escrow in connection with the
Equator acquisition was settled. We received proceeds net of legal fees of $4,800, which is
included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December31, 2006. 83 Table of Contents NOTE 9. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information is as follows

NOTE 10. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Preferred Stock The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0001
per share. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed on, each series of preferred stock. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, there is one series of preferred stock designated as the Special
Voting Share Series, of which there is one voting share issued and outstanding. The series was
designated and the share was issued in 2002 in connection with our Jaldi asset acquisition. The
voting share entitles the holders of exchangeable shares see below to vote on any matters that
come before the Pixelworks common shareholders. The holder of the voting share is not entitled to receive dividends. In the event of any
dissolution of the Company, the holder of the voting share is entitled to be paid out of the net
assets of the Company an amount equal to $0001, before any payment is made to the holders of
common stock. Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0001
per share. Shareholders of common stock have unlimited voting rights and are entitled to receive
the net assets of the Company upon dissolution, subject to the rights of the preferred
shareholders. Exchangeable Shares In connection with the Jaldi asset acquisition, Jaldi issued 1,731,099 exchangeable shares to its
shareholders. The voting share described above is held in trust for the benefit of the holders of
the exchangeable shares and provides the holders of the exchangeable shares with dividend, voting
and other 84 Table of Contents rights equivalent to those of Pixelworks common shareholders. These exchangeable shares
are the economic equivalent of Pixelworks common shares, and may be exchanged at any time for
Pixelworks common stock on a one-for-one basis. Stock Option Plans On May23, 2006, our shareholders approved the adoption of the Pixelworks, Inc. 2006 Stock
Incentive Plan the 2006 Plan, under which 4,000,000 shares of our common stock may be issued.
The 2006 Plan replaced our previously existing stock incentive plans including our 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended, our 2001 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, the Equator Technologies, Inc.
1996 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, and Equator Technologies, Inc. stand-alone option plans
collectively, Old Stock Incentive Plans. No additional options may be issued under the Old
Stock Incentive Plans, although previously granted awards under the Old Stock Incentive Plans
remain outstanding according to their original terms. On October26, 2006, our shareholders approved a stock option exchange program under which eligible
employees could elect to exchange eligible outstanding stock options. Eligible options were
surrendered in exchange for new options at a rate of 4-to-1, at the then current market price of
our common stock and have a new vesting schedule. These new options have a seven-year life with
33% vesting on June30, 2007 and the remaining 67% on a monthly basis over the following 12months,
for a total of 18months, subject to continued employment. On December4, 2006 the stock option
exchange was effectuated, whereby 184 employees surrendered 1,739,920 options in exchange for
434,980 options with an exercise price of $249 per share. Options granted must generally be exercised while the individual is an employee and within seven or
ten years of the date of grant. Our new hire vesting schedule provides that each option becomes
exercisable at a rate of 25% on the first anniversary date of the grant, and 2083% on the last day
of every month thereafter for a total of 36 additional increments. During August2006, we changed
our merit vesting schedule to provide that merit-type awards become exercisable monthly over a
period of three years. Prior to August2006, our merit vesting schedule provided that options
become exercisable monthly for a period of four years, with 10% becoming exercisable in the first
year, 20% becoming exercisable in the second year, 30% becoming exercisable in the third year and
40% becoming exercisable in the fourth year. In connection with our acquisition of Equator, we assumed the Equator Technologies, Inc. 1996 Stock
Incentive Plan and certain stand-alone Equator stock option plans and issued 1,263,417 options to
purchase Pixelworks common stock in exchange for Equator options outstanding hereunder. No
additional stock option grants were made under these plans. 85 Table of Contents The following is a summary of stock option activity

Item 5. Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the
supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of December31, 2006, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by
the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal control over
financial reporting as defined under Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how
well designed, have inherent limitations. We conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006. This assessment was based on criteria established in the
framework Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway
89 Table of Contents Commission. Based on our evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting using the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December31, 2006. Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on
managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears
below. Changes to Internal Controls There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of
2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
control over financial reporting. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Pixelworks, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pixelworks Inc. and subsidiaries the Company,
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 90 Table of Contents In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006 is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria
established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway CommissionCOSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2006, and our report dated March12, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Portland, Oregon
