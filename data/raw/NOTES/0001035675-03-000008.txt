Note A. Business Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
1. About NSTAR
NSTAR is an energy delivery company focusing its activities in
the transmission and distribution of energy. NSTAR serves
approximately 14 million customers in Massachusetts, including
approximately 11 million electric customers in 81 communities
and 03 million gas customers in 51 communities. NSTAR is a
public utility holding company generally exempt from the
provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
NSTAR retail utility subsidiaries are Boston Edison Company
Boston Edison, Commonwealth Electric Company ComElectric,
Cambridge Electric Light Company Cambridge Electric and NSTAR
Gas Company NSTAR Gas. Its wholesale electric subsidiary is
Canal Electric Company Canal. NSTAR three retail electric
companies operate under the brand name NSTAR Electric.
Reference in this report to NSTAR shall mean the registrant
NSTAR or one or more of its subsidiaries as the context requires.
Reference in this report to NSTAR Electric shall mean each of
Boston Edison, ComElectric and Cambridge Electric. NSTAR non-
utility, unregulated operations include district energy
operations Advanced Energy Systems, Inc. and NSTAR Steam
Corporation, telecommunications operations - NSTAR
Communications, Inc. NSTAR Com and a liquefied natural gas
service company Hopkinton LNG Corp.
2. Basis of Consolidation and Accounting
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the
results of operations, comprehensive income, retained earnings,
financial position and cash flows of NSTAR and its subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.
NSTAR utility subsidiaries follow accounting policies
prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC and
the Massachusetts Department of Telecommunications and Energy
MDTE. In addition, NSTAR and its subsidiaries are subject to
the accounting and reporting requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC. The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America GAAP. The utility
subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation SFAS 71. The application of SFAS 71 results in
differences in the timing of recognition of certain expenses from
that of other businesses and industries. The distribution
business remains subject to rate-regulation and continues to meet
the criteria for application of SFAS 71. Refer to Note D to
these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
regulatory assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management of NSTAR and its subsidiaries to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
3. Revenues
Utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the
MDTE and FERC. Estimates of transmission, distribution and
transition revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to
customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each
accounting period.
Revenues for NSTAR non-utility subsidiaries are recognized when
services are rendered or when the energy is delivered.
4. Utility Plant
Utility plant is stated at original cost of construction. The
costs of replacements of property units are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs and replacements of minor items are
expensed as incurred. The original cost of property retired, net
of salvage value, and the related costs of removal are charged to
accumulated depreciation.
5. Non-Utility Plant Non-utility property is stated at cost or its net realizable
value. The following is a summary of non-utility property and
equipment, at cost less accumulated depreciation, at December 31:
in thousands               2002      2001
Land                  $ 15,700    $ 15,987
Energy production equipment       71,333     66,729
Telecommunications equipment       37,856     33,065
Gas storage               42,701     42,701
Buildings and improvements        2,992     2,992
170,582    161,474
Less: accumulated depreciation     68,238    59,747
102,344    101,727
Construction work in progress      27,574     4,280
$129,918    $106,007
Depreciation expense on non-utility property and equipment was
$85 million for 2002 and $218 million for 2001.
6. Depreciation
Depreciation of utility plant is computed on a straight-line
basis using composite rates based on the estimated useful lives
of the various classes of property. The composite rates are
subject to the approval of the MDTE and FERC. The overall
composite depreciation rates for utility property were 326 302% and 306% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Depreciation of non-utility property is computed on a straight-
line basis over the estimated life of the asset. The estimated
depreciable service lives of the major components of non-utility
property and equipment at December 31, 2002 are as follows                 
Depreciable
Plant Component             Life
Energy production equipment       25-35
Telecommunications equipment       10
Liquefied gas storage facilities     28
Buildings and improvements        40
7. Costs Associated with Issuance and Redemption of Debt and
Preferred Stock
Consistent with the recovery in utility rates, discounts,
redemption premiums and related costs associated with the
issuance and redemption of long-term debt and preferred stock are
deferred. The costs related to long-term debt are recognized as
an addition to interest expense over the life of the original or
replacement debt. Consistent with an accounting order received
from the FERC, costs related to preferred stock issuances and
redemptions are reflected as a direct reduction to retained
earnings upon redemption or over the average life of the
replacement preferred stock series as applicable.
8. Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction AFUDC
AFUDC represents the estimated costs to finance utility plant
construction. In accordance with regulatory accounting, AFUDC is
included as a cost of utility plant and a reduction of current
interest charges. Although AFUDC is not a current source of cash
income, the costs are recovered from customers over the service
life of the related plant in the form of increased revenues
collected as a result of higher depreciation expense. Average
AFUDC rates in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 226%, 431% and 616 respectively, and represented only the cost of short-term debt
and excludes the impact of capitalized interest.
9. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are comprised of
liquid securities with maturities of 90 days or less when
purchased. Restricted cash primarily represents the net proceeds
from the sale of Canal generation assets that are required to
be used to reduce the transition costs that otherwise would be
billed to customers and funds held by a trustee in connection
with Advanced Energy System 6924% Note Agreement.
10. Equity Method of Accounting
NSTAR uses the equity method of accounting for investments in
corporate joint ventures in which it does not have a controlling
interest. Under this method, it records as income or loss the
proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint
ventures with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
carrying value of the investment. The investment is reduced as
cash dividends are received. NSTAR participates in several
corporate joint ventures in which it has investments, principally
its 145% equity investment in two companies that own and operate
transmission facilities to import electricity from the Hydro-
Quebec System in Canada, and its equity investments ranging from
25% to 14% in three regional nuclear facilities that are
currently being decommissioned.
11. Goodwill and Costs to Achieve
The merger that created NSTAR was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. The premium Goodwill associated
with the acquisition was approximately $490 million, while the
original estimate of transaction and integration costs to achieve
the merger was $111 million. The merger premium is reflected on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Goodwill. In
accordance with the MDTE settlement agreement, this premium
will continue to be amortized over 40 years and amounts to
approximately $122 million annually, while the costs to achieve
CTA are being amortized over 10 years. CTA are the costs
incurred to execute the merger including the employee costs for a
voluntary severance program, costs of financial advisers, legal
costs, and other transaction and systems integration costs. CTA
is being amortized at an annual rate of $111 million based on
the original rate plan. NSTAR will reconcile the actual CTA
costs incurred with the original estimate in a future rate
proceeding. This reconciliation will include a final accounting
of the deductibility for income tax purposes of each component of
CTA. The total CTA is approximately $143 million. This increase
from the original estimate is partially mitigated by the fact
that the portion of CTA that is not deductible for income tax
purposes is approximately $20 million lower than the original
estimate. NSTAR anticipates that these incremental costs are
probable of recovery in future rates. The CTA and Goodwill
amounts were filed and approved as part of the rate plan. Refer
to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142 in the New Accounting Standards section to follow for a
further discussion.
12. Stock Option Plan
NSTAR Share Incentive Plan is a stock-based employee
compensation plan, and is described more fully in the
accompanying Note H to Consolidated Financial Statements. NSTAR
applies the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and
related Interpretations in accounting for this plan. No stock-
based employee compensation expense for option grants is

14. New Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142. This Statement, which was
effective for NSTAR on January 1, 2002, establishes accounting
and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other
indefinite lived intangible assets. It prohibits entities from
continuing amortization of these assets. Instead, goodwill and
other intangible assets are subject to review for impairment.
However, in accordance with provisions of SFAS 142 and a revised
amendment to SFAS 71, NSTAR will continue amortizing goodwill
over its estimated regulatory recovery period. Goodwill on
NSTAR Consolidated Balance Sheets is subject to impairment in
accordance with provisions under SFAS 71. NSTAR has determined
that its regulatory rate structure, resulting from the merger and
approved by the MDTE, supports the continued amortization of
goodwill over 40 years, the period it is collected from its
customers.
On July 5, 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. This Statement, which
is effective for NSTAR on January 1, 2003, establishes accounting
and reporting standards for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal
operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations
of lessees. SFAS 143 requires entities to record the fair value
of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period
in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially
recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the
liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the
capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the
related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an entity
either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a
gain or loss upon settlement. Management is currently assessing
the impact of SFAS 143 in light of its regulatory and accounting
requirements. In its assessment, management has identified
several minor long-lived assets, including obligations under
lease and easement arrangements, and has determined that it is
legally responsible to remove such property and comply with the
requirements of this standard. However, based on NSTAR
assessment of its potential liability and rate regulatory
treatment for certain identified assets, the adoption of SFAS 143
will not have a material effect on NSTAR results of operations,
cash flows, or financial position.
SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets SFAS 144, was effective January 1, 2002, and
addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets. SFAS 144, among other things, expands the
reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of
an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest
of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing
operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. NSTAR has
reviewed and assessed for impairment certain of its non-utility
assets and based on its assessment, it has determined as of
December 31, 2002, that the implementation of SFAS 144 had no
effect on NSTAR results of operations or financial position.
The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS 146, that requires
entities to record a liability for costs related to exit or
disposal activities when the costs are incurred. Previous
accounting guidance required the liability to be recorded at the
date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. NSTAR is
required to comply with SFAS 146 beginning January 1, 2003.
NSTAR anticipates that the implementation of this standard will
not have an impact on its financial position or results of
operations.
In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others the
Interpretation. The Interpretation elaborates on the
disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial statements about its obligations under certain
guarantees it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is
required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a
prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December
31, 2002. For NSTAR, disclosure requirements are effective with
the 2002 Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this
report. Refer to Note O, Commitments and Contingencies, for
more discussion. The application of this Interpretation is
not expected to materially impact the financial condition,
results of operations, and cash flows of NSTAR.
15. Purchases and Sales Transactions with Independent System
Operator - New England ISO-NE
During 2001, as part of NSTAR Electric normal business
operations in order to meet its energy obligation to its standard
offer customers, NSTAR Electric entered into hourly transactions
to purchase or sell energy supply to its ISO-NE. The NSTAR
Electric transactions with the ISO-NE have been treated as the
ISO-NE servicing the incremental needs of NSTAR Electric, that
is, transactions with ISO-NE associated with the difference
between NSTAR Electric resource needs compared to NSTAR
Electric resource availability. NSTAR Electric records the net
effect of transactions with the ISO-NE as an adjustment to
purchased power expense.
During 2002, NSTAR Electric entered into an agreement whereby all
of its energy supply resource entitlements are transferred to an
independent energy supplier, following which NSTAR Electric
repurchases its energy resource needs from this independent
energy supplier for NSTAR Electric ultimate sale to its
standard offer customers. This transaction has been and will
continue to be recorded as a net purchase, similar to those
transactions with ISO-NE during 2001.
Note B. Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share EPS is calculated by dividing
net income, after deductions for preferred dividends, by the
weighted average common shares outstanding during the year. SFAS
No. 128, Earnings per Share, requires the disclosure of diluted
EPS. Diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS
except that the weighted average common shares is increased to
include the number of potential dilutive common shares. Diluted
EPS reflects the impact on shares outstanding of the deferred
nonvested shares and stock options granted under the NSTAR
Share Incentive Plan. The following table summarizes the reconciling amounts between
basic and diluted EPS:
in thousands, except per share amounts        2002   2001     2000
Earnings loss available for common shareholders $161,707  $2,426   $175,002

Note C. Investments - Available for Sale Securities
NSTAR classifies its investments in marketable securities as
available for sale. As of December 31, 2002, these investments
include 116 million common shares of RCN Corporation RCN and
represents approximately 106% of RCN outstanding common
shares.
As of December 31, 2001, these investments included 41 million
common shares of RCN, 148,400 common shares of John Hancock
Financial Services, Inc. John Hancock, and 141,300 common
shares of MetLife, Inc. MetLife. During 2002, NSTAR sold all
of its common shares in John Hancock and MetLife for a gain of
$49 million. This gain is recorded as part of Other Income, net
in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
In accordance with its accounting policies, NSTAR continuously
evaluates the carrying value of its investment in RCN to assess
whether any decline in the market value below its carrying value
is deemed to be other than temporary. Consistent with the
performance of the telecommunications sector as a whole, the
market value of RCN common shares decreased significantly
during the later part of 2000 and continued to decrease through
2002. As a result, in 2001 and 2002, management determined that
this decline in market value was other-than-temporary in
accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities.
NSTAR recognized non-cash, after-tax impairment charges in 2002
and 2001 on its investment in RCN common shares of $177 million
and $1739 million, respectively. These charges are reported on
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as Write-down
of RCN Investment, net. The income tax results of NSTAR
investment in RCN are described more fully in the accompanying
Note F to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The total carrying value of the 116 million RCN common shares is
included in Other investments on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets at its estimated fair value of approximately $61
million at December 31, 2002. The fair value of the 116 million
shares held may increase or decrease as a result of changes in
the market value of RCN common shares. As of December 31, 2002
and 2001, the market value per share of RCN was $053 and $293,
respectively. The unrealized gain or loss associated with these
shares will fluctuate due to the changes in fair value of these
securities during each period and is reflected, net of associated
income taxes, as a component of Other comprehensive income
loss, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Comprehensive Income. The cumulative increase or decrease in
fair value of these shares including the impact of the write-down
adjustments of these shares are included in Accumulated other
comprehensive income on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
Note D. Regulatory Assets
Regulatory assets represent costs incurred that are expected to
be collected from customers through future rates in accordance
with agreements with regulators. These costs are expensed when
the corresponding revenues are received in order to appropriately
match revenues and expenses. Regulatory assets consisted of the following:
December 31,
in thousands                   2002     2001
Power contracts including Yankee units   $ 773,922  $  53,041
Generation-related regulatory assets, net    542,485    686,519
Pension costs                  425,755       -
Merger costs to achieve             105,992    118,059
Income taxes                   50,666    53,375
Purchased power costs              30,375    45,413
Postretirement benefits costs          15,088    16,965
Redemption premiums               13,479    12,853
Other                      44,115    40,016
Total regulatory assets          $2,001,877  $1,026,241
Under the traditional revenue requirements model, electric rates
are based on the cost of providing electric service. Under this
model, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas are subject to certain
accounting standards that are not applicable to other businesses
and industries in general. The application of SFAS 71 requires
companies to defer the recognition of certain costs when incurred
if future rate recovery of these costs is expected. This is
applicable to NSTAR distribution and transmission operations.
Power contracts
Approximately $728 million at December 31, 2002 represents the
remaining unamortized balance of the estimated costs to close the
Connecticut Yankee CY, Yankee Atomic YA and Maine Yankee MY
nuclear power plants that are currently being decommissioned.
NSTAR liability for CY decommissioning and its recovery ends in
2007, for YA in 2010 and for MY in 2008. However, should the
actual costs exceed current estimates and anticipated
decommissioning dates, NSTAR could have an obligation beyond
these periods that would be fully recoverable. These costs are
recovered through NSTAR Electric transition charge. Refer to
Note O, Commitments and Contingencies, for more discussion.
The remaining balance includes $7011 million at December 31,
2002 representing the recognition of six purchased power
contracts as derivatives and their above-market value and future
recovery through NSTAR Electric transition charges. Refer to
Note E, Derivative Instruments - Power Contracts for further
details.
Generation-related plant regulatory assets
Plant and other regulatory assets related to the divestiture of
NSTAR generation business are recovered with a return through
the transition charge. This recovery occurs through 2016 for
Boston Edison, through 2023 for ComElectric and through 2011 for
Cambridge Electric. This schedule is subject to adjustment by
the MDTE.
As of December 31, 2002, $4936 million of these generation-
related regulatory assets are collateralized with the Transition
Property Securitization Certificates held by Boston Edison
subsidiary, BEC Funding, LLC. The certificates are non-recourse
to Boston Edison.
Pension costs
The regulatory asset attributable to pension costs represents the
deferral of pension related costs, which NSTAR expects to recover
from customers in future years. This amount results from the
reclassification of amounts, which in the absence of the MDTE
Accounting Order issued on December 20, 2002 see Note G, would
otherwise have been classified as a charge to other comprehensive
income pursuant to SFAS 87 as amended by SFAS 130. The amount
of the deferral consists of approximately $169 million that
represents the additional minimum pension liability recorded to
reflect the unfunded liability of NSTAR pension plan, and
approximately $257 million, which represents the adjustment to
reverse the prepaid pension costs. Prepaid pension costs
represent the cumulative excess of cash contribution over the
cumulative net periodic pension costs. For purposes of financial
statement presentation, the amount previously reported as prepaid
pension costs in 2001 has been displayed net of the additional
minimum pension liability in 2002, as required by SFAS 87.
Merger costs to achieve
An integral part of the merger is the rate plan of the retail
utility subsidiaries of NSTAR that was approved by the MDTE on
July 27, 1999. Significant elements of the rate plan include a
four-year distribution rate freeze, recovery of the acquisition
premium goodwill over 40 years and recovery of transaction and
integration costs costs to achieve over 10 years. Costs to
achieve are the costs incurred to execute the merger including
costs for a voluntary severance program, costs of financial
advisors, legal costs and other transaction and systems
integration costs. These costs are collected from all NSTAR
Electric and NSTAR Gas distribution customers and exclude a
return component. These costs have been adjusted since the
original recovery began and any unrecovered costs will be
included in each company next respective rate case filing.
Income taxes, net
The principal holder of this regulatory asset is Boston Edison.
Approximately $32 million of this regulatory asset balance
reflects deferred tax reserve deficiencies that the MDTE has
allowed recovery of from ratepayers over a 17 year period. In
addition, approximately $40 million in additional Boston Edison
deferred tax reserve deficiencies has been recorded in accordance
with an MDTE-approved settlement agreement. Offsetting these
amounts is approximately $21 million of a regulatory liability
associated with unamortized investment tax credits relating to
NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas.
Purchased power costs
The purchased power costs relate to deferred standard offer
service and deferred default service costs. Customers have the
option of continuing to buy power from the retail electric
distribution businesses at standard offer prices through February
2005. Since 1998, NSTAR has been allowed to defer the difference
between the retail price per kWh for standard offer and default
service revenues and the cost to supply the power, plus carrying
costs. Default service is the electricity that is supplied by
the local distribution company when a customer is not receiving
power from standard offer service. The market price for standard
offer and default service will fluctuate based on the average
market price for power. Amounts collected through standard offer
and default service are recovered on a fully reconciling basis.
Postretirement benefits costs
Cambridge Electric in its last base rate case was allowed by the
MDTE to recover costs over a four-year phase-in for the full tax
deductible amount of deferred postretirement costs other than
pension. Cambridge Electric will include any remaining
unrecovered costs in its next distribution rate case filing.
There is no current recovery of these deferred costs; however,
ComElectric is recovering its deferred postretirement costs other
than pension over a ten-year period with no return allowed.
ComElectric will include any remaining unrecovered costs in its
next distribution rate case filing. There is no current recovery
of these deferred costs. Boston Edison will include these costs
in its next base rate case filing. There is no current recovery
of these deferred costs.
Redemption premiums
These amounts reflect the unamortized balance of redemption
premium on Boston Edison Debentures that is amortized and
recovered over the life of the respective debentures pursuant to
MDTE approval. There is no return recognized on this balance.
Other
These amounts primarily consist of deferred transmission revenues
that are set to be recovered over a subsequent twelve-month
period. The deferred revenue represents the difference between
the level of billed transmission revenues and the current period
costs incurred to provide transmission-related services.
Also included are environmental reserves and response costs that
represent the recovery of costs to clean up former gas
manufacturing sites over a 7-year period without a return.
Note E. Derivative Instruments - Power Contracts
NSTAR adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, effective January
1, 2001. The accounting for derivative financial instruments is
subject to change based on the guidance received from the
Derivative Implementation Group DIG of FASB. The DIG issued
No. C15, Scope Exceptions: Normal Purchases and Normal Sales
Exception for Option-Type Contracts and Forward Contracts in
Electricity on October 10, 2001, which specifically addressed
the interpretation of clearly and closely related contracts that
qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception under SFAS
133. The conclusion reached by the DIG was that contracts with a
pricing mechanism that is subject to future adjustment based on a
generic index that is not specifically related to the contracted
service commodity generally would not qualify for the normal
purchases and sales exception.
On April 1, 2002, the effective date of DIG Issue C15, NSTAR
adopted the interpretation of this guidance and began marking to
market certain of its long-term purchased power contracts that
previously qualified for the normal purchases and sales
exception. NSTAR has six purchased power contracts that contain
components with pricing mechanisms that are based on a pricing
index, such as the GNP or CPI. Although these factors are only
applied to certain ancillary pricing components of these
agreements, as required by the interpretation of DIG Issue C15,
NSTAR began recording these contracts at fair value on its
Consolidated Balance Sheets during 2002. This action resulted in
the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the above-
market portion of these contracts at December 31, 2002 of
approximately $701 million and is a component of Deferred credits
- - Power contracts on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. NSTAR has recorded a corresponding regulatory asset to
reflect the future recovery of the above-market component of
these contracts through its transition charge. Therefore, as a
result of this regulatory treatment, the recording of these
contracts on its accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets does
not result in an earnings impact.
NSTAR has other purchased power contracts in which the contract
value is significantly above-market. However, these contracts
have met the criteria for the normal purchases and sales exception
pursuant to SFAS 133 and DIG Issue C15 and have not been recorded
on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The above-
market portion of these contracts is currently being recovered
through the transition charge. Therefore, NSTAR does not account
for these types of capacity and energy contracts, gas supply
contracts, or purchase orders for numerous supply arrangements as
derivatives.
Note F. Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. SFAS 109 requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future
tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. In accordance with
SFAS 109, net regulatory assets of $507 million and $534
million and corresponding net increases in accumulated deferred
income taxes were recorded as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The regulatory assets represent the additional
future revenues to be collected from customers for deferred
income taxes. Accumulated deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax
credits consisted of the following:

a. Tax Valuation Allowance
SFAS 109 prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of
deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that
the deferred tax asset will not be realized. NSTAR had
determined that it was more likely than not that a current or
future income tax benefit would not be realized relating to the
write-downs of its RCN investment that were recorded in the
second and fourth quarters of 2002 and previously in the first
quarter of 2001. These write-downs resulted from the significant
declines in the market value of the telecommunications sector,
including RCN. As a result of this uncertainty, NSTAR recorded a
$776 million tax valuation allowance on the entire tax benefit
associated with these write-downs. During 2002, as a result of
previously unanticipated capital gain transactions, NSTAR
recognized $39 million of this tax benefit.
Additionally, based on the Internal Revenue Service IRS review
of NSTAR 1999 and 2000 federal income tax returns, NSTAR
determined that it was more likely than not that it would
ultimately recognize the tax benefits relating to the incremental
operating losses from the joint venture. The returns are
currently being audited by the IRS as part of their normal review
of NSTAR consolidated federal income tax returns. The tax
valuation allowance included reserves relating to the tax
treatment of these losses through June 19, 2002. Each of the tax
returns filed for 1999 through 2001 claimed operating losses.
The return to be filed for 2002 will also claim the remaining
portion of these operating losses. The issues involving the
operating loss deductions recorded on the tax returns for the
years 2001 and 2002 are substantially similar to those that had
concerned NSTAR regarding the tax treatment of that item on the
1999 and 2000 returns. Based on the IRS examining agent
current review, no adjustment for the years under audit is
proposed. A determination of this issue was arrived at in the
fourth quarter of 2002 and, as a result, NSTAR applied the
treatment of these operating losses for all years on a consistent
basis, allowing a reduction to its valuation allowance of
approximately $197 million as a net credit to income tax expense
included as a component of the write-down of the RCN investment.
NSTAR has and will continue to research potential transactions
that improve the operational efficiencies of NSTAR while
maximizing the utilization of these potential tax benefits.
Should NSTAR be successful in its tax and operational planning to
allow a portion of the remaining tax benefit to be ultimately
realized, NSTAR will reflect a credit to its income tax expense.
Future earnings could be positively impacted by the outcome of
this strategy. The maximum potential positive future earnings
impact is currently estimated at $53 million. Management is
currently unable to determine when, whether, or the extent to
which NSTAR will be able to recognize this potential benefit.
b. Tax Gain on Generating Assets
The cost of transitioning to retail open access was mitigated, in
part, by the sale of Commonwealth Energy System COM/Energy
now a wholly owned subsidiary of NSTAR non-nuclear generating
assets. COM/Energy completed the sale of substantially all of
its non-nuclear generating assets in 1998. Proceeds from the
sale of these assets amounted to approximately $4539 million, or
61 times their book value of approximately $742 million. The
proceeds from the sale, net of book value, transaction costs and
certain other adjustments amounted to $3586 million and are
required to be used for the benefit of COM/Energy customers under
MDTE rate setting policies. In this instance, the amount was
used to reduce transition costs of Cambridge Electric and
ComElectric related to electric industry restructuring.
COM/Energy determined that this transaction was not a taxable
event because it did not provide an economic benefit to its
shareholders. The amount, if not for this treatment, that would
otherwise have been paid in taxes is approximately $136 million.
Should COM/Energy ultimately lose this issue, tax deductions
resulting in tax savings of approximately $136 million would be
realized by COM/Energy over a period of years. During the second
quarter of 2002, NSTAR was notified that the IRS intended to file
a Request for Technical Advice with the IRS National Office with
regard to COM/Energy tax treatment of this item. As of
December 31, 2002, the Requests for Technical Advice had not yet
been filed.
The IRS is in the process of completing its audit of COM/Energy
tax returns for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. The audit will
not be closed at the examination level until the issue described
above has been resolved either by the IRS closing the audit with
no adjustment for the item or by providing COM/Energy with a tax
deficiency notice. Should COM/Energy be issued a deficiency
notice it must then decide to either contest the notice at IRS
Appellate or in a court of law or concede the issue. It is
expected that once the request for Technical Advice is filed, a
National Office decision would be made within two months. Should
NSTAR position be challenged, it is probable that NSTAR will
make a tax payment of approximately $60 million in order to stop
the accrual of interest on the potential remaining tax deficiency
for all years involved through 2002. NSTAR intends to vigorously
defend its position, which is supported by an opinion from an
independent tax advisor, relative to this transaction and
anticipates pursuing a refund of any amounts paid plus interest.
In addition, NSTAR would pursue regulatory rate recovery for the
interest on tax deficiencies should any amounts ultimately be
incurred as a result of this transaction. The MDTE has provided
written acknowledgements to NSTAR indicating: 1 its
understanding of the issue; and 2 COM/Energy ability to seek
recovery of costs relating to the tax deficiency that may be
incurred. NSTAR believes that recovery from customers is
probable in view of the MDTE position and its understanding of
the monetary benefits to be realized by COM/Energy customers
should it be successful in defending its position. However, if
NSTAR is unsuccessful with the IRS and unsuccessful in getting
favorable regulatory treatment, it is possible that it could have
an adverse impact on NSTAR results of operations, cash flows
and financial position.
Note G. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
1. Pension
NSTAR sponsors a defined benefit funded retirement plan the
Plan that covers substantially all employees. NSTAR also
maintains unfunded supplemental retirement plans for certain
management employees.
In 2002, the Plan was amended to comply with the Economic Growth
and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 EGTRRA. EGTRRA,
among other things, increased the annual benefits limit for
amounts payable from the Plan to $160,000, increased the number
of rollover options for distributions, and allowed surviving
spouses to rollover distributions to their employer plan. This
amendment also brought the Plan into conformance with recently
issued IRS revenue rulings and regulations that require the
change of the mortality table used for computing lump sum pension
distributions and annuity conversions. The changes in benefit obligation and Plan assets were as
follows:
December 31,

Funded Status
NSTAR qualified Plan assets have been affected by significant
declines in the equity markets in the past three years. These
conditions have impacted the funded status of the Plan at
December 31, 2002. As a result of the negative investment
performance, at December 31, 2002, the accumulated benefit
obligation exceeded Plan assets. Therefore, NSTAR is required to
recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by SFAS
No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87 and SFAS
No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about Pensions and
Postretirement Benefits. The additional minimum liability
results in the netting of the Prepaid pension cost with the
additional minimum liability on the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
Under SFAS 87, NSTAR is also required to net its prepaid pension
balance. The additional minimum pension liability adjustment,
which is equal to the sum of the minimum pension liability and
the prepaid pension adjustment, would be recorded, net of taxes,
as a non-cash charge to Other Comprehensive Income OCI on the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and
would not affect the results of operations for 2002. The fair
value of Plan assets and the ABO are measured at each year-end
balance sheet date. The minimum liability will be adjusted each
year to reflect this measurement. At such time that the Plan
assets exceed the ABO, the minimum liability would be reversed.
In November 2002, NSTAR filed a request with the MDTE seeking an
accounting ruling to mitigate the impact of the non-cash charge
to OCI in 2002 and the increases in expected pension and PBOP
costs in 2003. On December 20, 2002, the MDTE approved the
Accounting Order. Based on this Accounting Order and an opinion
from legal counsel regarding the probability of recovery of these
costs in the future, NSTAR recorded a regulatory asset in lieu of
taking a charge to OCI at December 31, 2002. In addition, the
order permits NSTAR to defer, as a regulatory asset or liability,
the difference between the level of pension and PBOP expense that
is included in rates and the amounts that are required to be
recorded under SFAS 87 and SFAS 106 beginning in 2003.
The regulatory asset of $426 million, recorded as a result of this
accounting ruling, consists of the prepaid pension asset $257
million and includes the additional minimum liability $169 million
incurred at December 31, 2002. The regulatory asset is shown as part
of Deferred debits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
2. Other Postretirement Benefits
NSTAR provides health care and other benefits to retired
employees who meet certain age and years of service eligibility
requirements. These benefits include health and life insurance
coverage and reimbursement until April 1, 2003 of certain
Medicare premiums. Under certain circumstances, eligible
employees are required to make contributions for postretirement
benefits. The changes in benefit obligation and plan assets were as
follows:
December 31,

per capita cost of covered medical claims was assumed for 2003.
This rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 5% in 2013 and
remain at that level thereafter. Dental claims and Medicare
premiums are assumed to increase at a weighted annual rate of 4%
and 5%, respectively. The expected rate of return on plan assets
is 8% in 2003. A 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have
the following effects:

3. Savings Plan
NSTAR also provides a defined contribution 401k plan for
substantially all employees. Matching contributions which are
equal to 50% of the employees' deferral up to 8% of compensation
included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income
amounted to $9 million in both 2002 and in 2001, and $7 million
in 2000. The plan was amended, effective April 1, 2001, to allow
participants the ability to reallocate their investments in the
NSTAR Common Share Fund to other investment options. Effective
January 1, 2002, consistent with the EGTRRA, the plan was further
amended to allow for increased maximum annual pre-tax
contributions and additional catch-up pre-tax contributions for
participants age 50 or older, acceptance of other types of roll-
over pre-tax funds from other plans and the option of
reinvesting dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share Fund or
receiving such dividends in cash. The election to reinvest
dividends paid on the NSTAR Common Share Fund or receive the
dividends in cash is subject to a freeze period beginning seven
days prior to the date any dividend is paid. During this period,
participants cannot change their election. Dividends are paid to
this plan four times a year on February 1, May 1, August 1, and
November 1.
Note H. Stock-Based Compensation
The NSTAR Share Incentive Plan the Plan permits a variety of
stock and stock-based awards, including stock options and
deferred non-vested stock to be granted to key employees. The
Plan limits the terms of awards to ten years. Subject to
adjustment for stock-splits and similar events, the aggregate
number of common shares that may be awarded under the Plan is
four million as a result of an amendment to the Plan approved by
shareholders in 2002 that increased the number of shares
available for issuance from two million to four million,
including shares issued in lieu of or upon reinvestment of
dividends arising from awards. The weighted average grant date
fair value of the deferred stock issued during 2002, 2001 and
2000 was $4524, $3970 and $4438, respectively. During 2002,
45,300 deferred shares and 265,000 ten-year non-qualified stock
options were granted under the Plan. During 2001, 97,850
deferred shares and 240,500 ten-year non-qualified stock options
were granted. During 2000, 69,750 deferred shares and 316,700
ten-year non-qualified stock options were granted. The options
were granted at the full market price of the common shares on the
date of the grant. All the awards vest ratably over a three-year
period. Stock option activity of the Plan was as follows:

The 780% series debentures due 2023 are first redeemable in
March 2003 at 10373%. There are no sinking fund requirements
for any series of debentures.
Sewage facility revenue bonds are tax-exempt, subject to annual
mandatory sinking fund redemption requirements and mature through
2015. Scheduled redemptions of $16 million were made in 2002
and 2001. The weighted average interest rate of the bonds was
74% in 2002 and 2001.
The 575% tax-exempt unsecured MIFA bonds due 2014 are redeemable
beginning in February 2004 at a redemption price of 102%. The
redemption price decreases to 101% in February 2005 and to par in
February 2006.
On October 15, 2002, Boston Edison issued two new debentures 400 million, 4875% due in 2012 and $100 million, floating rate
debentures due in 2005 priced at three-month LIBOR plus 50 basis
points. Boston Edison used the proceeds to pay down short-term
debt and anticipates it will use approximately $40 million to
fund its $150 million debt maturing in March 2003.
The aggregate principal amounts of NSTAR long-term debt
including securitization certificates and sinking fund
requirements due in the five years subsequent to 2002 are
approximately $213 million in 2003, $79 million in 2004, $178
million in 2005, $98 million in 2006 and $84 million in 2007.
2. Financial Covenant Requirements
NSTAR and Boston Edison have no financial covenant requirements
under their respective long-term debt arrangements. ComElectric,
Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas have financial covenant
requirements under their long-term debt arrangements and were in
compliance at December 31, 2002 and 2001. NSTAR long-term debt
other than the Mortgage Bonds of NSTAR Gas is unsecured.
The Transition Property Securitization Certificates held by
Boston Edison subsidiary, BEC Funding, LLC, is collaterized
with a securitized regulatory asset with a balance of $4936
million as of December 31, 2002. Boston Edison, as servicing
agent for BEC Funding, collected $1057 million in 2002. These
collected funds are remitted daily to the trustee of BEC Funding.
These Certificates are non-recourse to Boston Edison.
NSTAR had a $450 million revolving credit agreement with a group
of banks effective through November 2002. NSTAR lowered this
credit facility to $350 million that consists of a three year 175 million revolving credit agreement that expires on November
14, 2005 and a 364-day, $175 million agreement that expires on
November 14, 2003. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no
amounts outstanding under these revolving credit agreements.
These arrangements serve as backup to NSTAR $350 million
commercial paper program that, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, had
$635 million and $3155 million outstanding, respectively. In
October 2002, following receipt of the proceeds of Boston
Edison $500 million debt issue previously referenced, NSTAR
used the entire proceeds to pay down on its total consolidated
debt. Under the terms of this credit agreement, NSTAR is
required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total
capitalization ratio of not greater than 65% at all times,
excluding Transition Property Securitization Certificates and
excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income from Common
equity, and to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before
interest and taxes to consolidated total interest expense of not
less than 2 to 1 for each period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters. Commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement
amount. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, NSTAR was in full
compliance with all of the aforementioned covenants.
Boston Edison had approval from the FERC to issue up to $350
million of short-term debt until December 31, 2002. On May 31,
2002, Boston Edison received FERC authorization to issue short-
term debt securities from time to time on or before December 31,
2004, with maturity dates no later than December 31, 2005, in
amounts such that the aggregate principal does not exceed $350
million at any one time. Boston Edison had a $300 million
revolving credit agreement with a group of banks effective
through December 2002. Boston Edison replaced this credit
facility with a 364-day, $350 million revolving credit agreement
that expires on November 14, 2003. At December 31, 2002 and
2001, there were no amounts outstanding under these revolving
credit agreements. These arrangements serve as backup to Boston
Edison $350 million commercial paper program that had no
outstanding balance at December 31, 2002 and had an outstanding
balance of $1915 million at December 31, 2001. In October 2002,
following receipt of the proceeds of its $500 million debt issue
previously referenced, its short-term debt balance was reduced to
zero. Under the terms of this agreement, Boston Edison is
required to maintain a maximum total consolidated debt to total
capitalization of not greater than 60% at all times, excluding
Transition Property Securitization Certificates and excluding
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income from Common equity.
Commitment fees must be paid on the total agreement amount. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, Boston Edison was in full compliance
with all of the aforementioned covenants.
On September 16, 2002, Boston Edison retired the $60 million
825% Series Debentures, due 2022. A $23 million redemption
premium was paid; this transaction had minimal impact on
earnings.
In addition, ComElectric, Cambridge Electric and NSTAR Gas,
collectively, have $170 million available under several lines of
credit and had $1351 million and $1178 million outstanding
under these lines of credit at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. ComElectric had approval from FERC to issue short-
term debt in an amount not exceeding $100 million until November
29, 2002. On May 31, 2002, ComElectric and Cambridge Electric
received FERC authorization to issue short-term debt securities
from time to time on or before November 30, 2004 and June 27,
2004, with maturity dates no later than November 29, 2005 and
June 26, 2005, respectively, in amounts such that the aggregate
principal does not exceed $125 million and $60 million,
respectively, at any one time. NSTAR Gas is not required to seek
approval from FERC to issue short-term debt.
Interest rates on the outstanding borrowings generally are money
market rates and averaged 189% and 413% in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. In aggregate, notes payable to banks discussed
above totaled $1986 million and $6248 million at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.
Note K. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each class of securities for which it is
practicable to estimate the value 1. Cash and Cash Equivalents
The carrying amounts of $534 million and $117 million for 2002
and 2001, respectively, approximate fair value due to the short-
term nature of these securities.
2. Indebtedness Excluding Notes Payable The fair values of long-term indebtedness are based upon the
quoted market prices of similar issues. Carrying amounts and fair
values as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:
2002           2001

including current maturities  $2,304,101 $2,422,440  $1,970,451 $2,076,190 Note L. Segment and Related Information
For the purpose of providing segment information, NSTAR
principal operating segments, or its traditional core businesses,
are the electric and natural gas utilities that provide energy
delivery services in 107 cities and towns in Massachusetts.
NSTAR subsidiaries also supply electricity at wholesale to
municipalities.
The unregulated operating segment engages in business activities
that include district energy operations, telecommunications and a
liquefied natural gas service. Amounts shown on the following
table for 2002, 2001 and 2000 include the allocation of NSTAR
parent company results of operations and assets, net of inter-
company transactions, and primarily consist of interest charges
and investment assets, respectively, to these business segments.
The allocation of parent company charges is based on an indirect
allocation of the parent company investment relating to these
various business segments.
In addition, the unregulated net loss for 2002, 2001 and 2000
reflects reductions in the carrying value of NSTAR investment
and its ultimate discontinuance of certain chilled water
operations in the amount of $1 million, $49 million and $35
million, respectively. During 2000, NSTAR notified certain
chilled water customers of its decision to exit a portion of that
business and that service ceased effective September 30, 2002, in
accordance with its contractual obligations. As part of the 2001
charge, NSTAR carrying value of this investment has been
written-off entirely. In addition, in 2002 and 2001, NSTAR had
reserved for the removal costs of those assets. The net loss for
2002 and 2001 for the unregulated operations segment also
includes the impact of non-cash, after-tax charges of $177
million and $1739 million, respectively, or $033 and $328 per
share, related to the write-down of NSTAR investment in RCN
Corporation.
Excluding the impact of transactions related to NSTAR
investment in RCN, NSTAR chilled water operations and the
negative effect of the allocation of parent company losses, the
unregulated operations segment would otherwise reflect a minimal
level of net income for the periods shown.

Note M. Long-Term Contracts for the Purchase of Energy
1. NSTAR Electric Power Purchase Agreements
NSTAR Electric expects to continue to make periodic market
solicitations for default service and standard offer power supply
consistent with provisions of the Massachusetts Electric
Restructuring Act of 1997 Restructuring Act and MDTE orders.
NSTAR Electric has existing long-term power purchase agreements
that are expected to supply approximately 80%-85% of its standard
offer service obligation for 2003. NSTAR Electric has contracted
with a third party supplier to provide 100% of its standard offer
supply obligation through December 31, 2003. In connection with
this arrangement, NSTAR Electric has assigned its long-term power
purchase agreements to this supplier through December 31, 2003.
NSTAR Electric is recovering its payments to suppliers through
MDTE approved rates billed to customers. NSTAR Electric
existing portfolio of long-term power purchase contracts supplied
the majority of its standard offer including wholesale energy
requirements in 2002. Also during 2002, NSTAR Electric entered
into an agreement whereby all of its energy supply resource
entitlements were transferred to an independent energy supplier,
following which NSTAR Electric repurchased its energy resource
needs from this independent energy supplier for NSTAR Electric
ultimate sale to its standard offer customers.
Capacity costs of long-term contracts reflect NSTAR Electric
proportionate share of capital and fixed operating costs of
certain generating units. In 2002, these costs were attributed
to 7237 MW of capacity purchased. Energy costs are paid to
generators based on a price per kWh actually received into NSTAR
Electric distribution system and are included in the total
cost. Total capacity purchased in 2002 was 1,7051 MW. Information related to long-term power contracts during 2002 was
as follows:

Total                 1,7051  $187,097 $666,185   $1,696,571
NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase
agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation
for the period January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003 and for 50%
of its obligation for the second-half of 2003. A Request for
Proposals will be issued in the second quarter of 2003 for the
remainder of the obligation. NSTAR Electric entered into
agreements ranging in length from five to twelve-months effective
January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 with suppliers to
provide full default service energy and ancillary service
requirements at contract rates approved by the MDTE.
NSTAR Electric total capacity and/or energy costs associated
with these contracts in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were approximately
$666 million, $678 million and $720 million, respectively.
NSTAR Electric capacity charge obligation under these contracts
for the years after 2002 are as follows

2. NSTAR Gas Supply and Storage Agreements
NSTAR Gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of
gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate
pipelines, market area storage and peaking services. In order to
control costs and to efficiently manage the gas supply needs of
its customers, NSTAR Gas optimizes its supply mix to ensure
maximum resource utilization. NSTAR Gas purchases
transportation, storage and balancing services from Tennessee Gas
Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well
as other upstream pipelines that bring gas from major producing
regions in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico and Canada to the final
delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area. NSTAR Gas
purchases all of its gas supplies from third-party vendors,
primarily under firm contracts with terms of less than one year.
The vendors vary from small independent marketers to major gas
and oil producers.
NSTAR Gas also utilizes contracts for underground storage and
liquefied natural gas LNG facilities to meet its winter peaking
demands. The underground storage contracts are a combination of
existing and new agreements that are the result of FERC Order 636
service unbundling. During the summer injection season, excess
pipeline capacity is used to deliver and store gas in market area
storage facilities, located in the New York and Pennsylvania
region. Stored gas is withdrawn during the winter season to
supplement pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating
demand. NSTAR Gas has firm storage capacity entitlements of over
75 billion cubic feet.
NSTAR Gas has various contractual agreements covering the
transportation of natural gas, underground and liquefied natural
gas storage facilities, which are recoverable from customers
under the MDTE approved Cost of Gas Adjustment Clause of NSTAR
Gas. These contracts expire at various times from 2003 to 2013.
NSTAR Gas' firm contract demand charges associated with firm
pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts in 2002,
2001 and 2000 were approximately $518 million, $518 million and
$543 million, respectively. NSTAR Gas' firm contract demand
charges at current rates under these contracts for the years
after 2002 are as follows

Note N. Other Utility Matters
Service Quality Index
On October 29, 2001, and as subsequently updated, NSTAR Electric
and NSTAR Gas filed proposed service quality plans for each
company with the MDTE. The service quality plans established
performance benchmarks effective January 1, 2002 for certain
identified measures of service quality relating to customer
service and billing performance, customer satisfaction, and
reliability and safety performance. The companies are required
to report annually concerning their performance as to each
measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two percent
of transmission and distribution revenues should performance fail
to meet the applicable benchmarks. Concurrently, NSTAR Electric
and NSTAR Gas filed with the MDTE a report of their performance
on the identified service quality measures for the two twelve-
month periods ended August 31, 2000 and 2001. This report
included a calculation of penalties in accordance with MDTE
guidelines. On March 22, 2002, following hearings on the matter,
the MDTE issued an order imposing a service quality penalty of
approximately $325 million on NSTAR Electric that was refunded
to customers as a credit to their bills during the month of May
2002. This refund had no material effect on NSTAR consolidated
financial position, cash flows or results of operations in 2002.
For the four-month period ended December 31, 2001, the MDTE
determined that NSTAR performance relative to service quality
measures did not warrant a penalty assessment.
On February 28, 2003, NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas filed their
2002 Service Quality Reports with the MDTE that reflected
significant improvements in reliability and performance and
indicate that no penalty will be assessed for this period. NSTAR
accounts for its service quality penalties pursuant to SFAS No.
5, Accounting for Contingencies. Accordingly, these penalties
are monitored on a monthly basis to determine NSTAR contingent
liability, and if NSTAR determines it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and is estimable, NSTAR would then
accrue an appropriate liability. Annually, each NSTAR utility
subsidiary makes a service quality performance filing with the
MDTE. Any settlement or rate order that would result in a
different liability or credit level from what has been accrued
would be adjusted in the period an agreement is reached with the
MDTE.
Generating Assets Divestiture
a. Seabrook Nuclear Power Station
On November 1, 2002, FPL Group, Inc. purchased 88% of the
majority ownership interest in the Seabrook Nuclear Power
Station, including Canal 352% ownership interest, for $7994
million, net of closing adjustments. FPL Group assumed
responsibility for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility
and received the Seabrook decommissioning funds of approximately
$2269 million at the closing. Canal portion of the sale
proceeds amounted to $319 million, of which $35 million was
paid into the decommissioning trust as a final top-off and $13
million was used for other transaction costs. The net proceeds
of $271 million were less than Canal remaining investment in
Seabrook. The difference of approximately $167 million will be
included as a component of Cambridge Electric and ComElectric
transition cost recovery and is expected to be collected from
ComElectric and Cambridge Electric customers in 2003 through
the transition charge. As part of this sale, all purchased power
agreements were terminated. The Seabrook sale did not have an
impact on NSTAR current results of operations. The future
impact of the sale will not have a material effect on results of
operations, cash flow or financial position.
b. Blackstone Station
On August 1, 2002, Cambridge Electric reached a tentative
agreement to sell Blackstone Station to Harvard University
Harvard for $146 million that will be used to reduce Cambridge
Electric transition charge. At the same time, NSTAR Steam
signed an agreement with Harvard to sell its Blackstone steam
assets and contracts to Harvard for $3 million. The sale is
subject to the approval of the MDTE. A filing with the MDTE for
regulatory approval for this transaction was made on November 21,
2002. Under terms of this agreement, NSTAR Steam will continue
to manage the day-to-day operations of the steam plant on this
site for one year after the sale. Cambridge Electric is
divesting its electric generating assets consistent with the
provisions of the Restructuring Act. Cambridge Electric divested
the majority of its non-nuclear generating facilities in 1998.
NSTAR anticipates completing the Blackstone Station sale in the
second quarter of 2003.
Note O. Commitments and Contingencies
1. Contractual Commitments
NSTAR also has leases for facilities and equipment. The
estimated minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable
capital and operating leases for the years after 2002 are as
follows              
in thousands
2003            $ 21,854
2004             20,085
2005             16,767
2006             14,191
2007             11,433
Years thereafter       45,633
Total           $129,963
The total expense for both lease rentals and transmission
agreements was $866 million in 2002, $827 million in 2001 and
$677 million in 2000, net of capitalized expenses of $23
million in 2002, $29 million in 2001 and $23 million in 2000.
Total rent expense for all operating leases, except those with
terms of a month or less, amounted to $74 million in 2002, $83
million in 2001 and $87 million in 2000.
NSTAR Electric has entered into a short-term power purchase
agreement to meet its entire default service supply obligation
for the period January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003 and for 50%
of its obligation for the second-half of 2003. A Request for
Proposals will be issued in the second quarter of 2003 for the
remainder of the obligation. NSTAR Electric entered into
agreements ranging in length from five to twelve-months effective
January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 with suppliers to
provide full default service energy and ancillary service
requirements at contract rates approved by the MDTE. NSTAR
Electric is completely recovering all of the payments it is
making to suppliers and has financial and performance assurances
and financial guarantees in place with those suppliers to protect
NSTAR Electric from risk in the unlikely event any of its
suppliers encounter financial difficulties or fail to maintain an
investment grade credit rating. In connection with certain of
these agreements, should, in the unlikely event, an individual
NSTAR Electric distribution company receive a credit rating below
investment grade, that company potentially could be required to
obtain certain financial commitments, including but not limited
to, letters of credit. Refer to Note M, Long-Term Contracts for
the Purchase of Energy for a further discussion.
2. Electric Equity Investments and Joint Ownership Interest
NSTAR Electric has an equity investment of approximately 145% in
two companies that own and operate transmission facilities to
import electricity from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada. As an
equity participant, NSTAR Electric is required to guarantee, in
addition to each companies' own share, the obligations of those
participants who do not meet certain credit criteria. At
December 31, 2002, NSTAR Electric portion of these guarantees
amounted to $13 million. New England Hydro-Transmission Electric
Company, Inc. NEH and New England Hydro-Transmission
Corporation NHH have agreed to use their best efforts to limit
their equity investment to 40% of their total capital during the
time NEH and NHH have outstanding debt in their capital
structure. In order to meet its best efforts obligation pursuant
to the Equity Funding Agreement dated June 1, 1985, as amended,
for NEH and NHH, in 2002, NEH repurchased a total of 325,000 of
its outstanding shares from all equity holders and NHH
repurchased a total of 1,725 outstanding shares from all equity
holders. Through December 31, 2002, NSTAR Electric reduction
of its equity ownership resulting from NEH buy-back of 47,018
shares and NHH buy-back of 250 shares was approximately
$1,139,000.
Canal had owned a 352% joint ownership interest in the Seabrook
Nuclear Power Station Seabrook until November 1, 2002. On this
date, FPL Group, Inc. closed on its purchase of an 88% majority
ownership interest in Seabrook, including Canal 352% interest
for $7994 million, net of closing adjustments. Among other
things, FPL Group, Inc. assumed responsibility for the ultimate
decommissioning of the Seabrook facility and received the
decommissioning funds of approximately $2269 million. Canal
portion of the proceeds amounted to $319 million, less the $35
million paid into the decommissioning trust as a final top-off
and $13 million for other transaction costs. The net proceeds
of $271 million were less than Canal remaining investment in
Seabrook. The net result of this transaction will be included as
a component of Cambridge Electric and ComElectric transition
cost recovery of approximately $167 million and is expected to
be collected from Cambridge Electric and ComElectric
customers in 2003 through the transition charge. As part of this
sale, all purchased power agreements were terminated. This
transaction did not have an impact on NSTAR current results of
operations. The future impact of this transaction will not have
a material effect on operations.
Cambridge Electric had a 265% interest in the Vermont Yankee
nuclear power plant. On July 31, 2002, Vermont Yankee was sold
for approximately $180 million to Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee,
LLC Entergy. The sale agreement provided, among other items,
that Entergy assume responsibility for the ultimate
decommissioning of the facility and received the Vermont Yankee
decommissioning funds. Pursuant to the terms of an Additional
Power Contract, Cambridge Electric is obligated to purchase its
25% entitlement percentage of the output of the plant through
the current license term ending in March 2012. The plant
owners, before the sale, were a consortium of New England
utilities, including Cambridge Electric. This transaction did
not have an impact on NSTAR results of operations. The net
result of this transaction was included as a component of
Cambridge Electric transition cost recovery and is reflected on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a Regulatory
asset.
NSTAR Electric collectively has an equity ownership of 14% in
Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company CYAPC, 14% in Yankee
Atomic Electric Company YAEC, and 4% in Maine Yankee Atomic
Power Company, the Yankee Companies. Periodically, NSTAR
obtains estimates from the management of the Yankee Companies on
the cost of decommissioning the Connecticut Yankee nuclear unit
CY, the Yankee Atomic nuclear unit YA, and the Maine Yankee
nuclear unit MY. These nuclear units are completely shut down
and are currently conducting decommissioning activities.
Based on estimates from the Yankee Companies' management as of
December 31, 2002, the total remaining cost for decommissioning
each nuclear unit is approximately as follows: $248 million for
CY, $225 million for YA and $166 million for MY. Of these
amounts, NSTAR Electric is obligated to pay $347 million towards
the decommissioning of CY, $315 million toward YA, and $66
million toward MY. These estimates are recorded in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as Power contract
liabilities with a corresponding regulatory asset. These
estimates may be revised from time to time based on information
available to the Yankee Companies regarding future costs.
NSTAR expects the Yankee Companies to seek recovery of these
costs and any additional increases to these costs in rate
applications with the FERC, with any resulting adjustments being
charged to their respective sponsors, including NSTAR Electric.
NSTAR Electric would recover its share of any allowed increases
from customers through its own filings with the MDTE.
The various decommissioning trusts for which NSTAR or its
subsidiaries are responsible through their equity ownership are
established pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 18
- - Conservation of Power and Water Resources. The investment of
decommissioning funds that have been established, are managed in
accordance with these federal guidelines, state jurisdictions and
with the applicable Internal Revenue Service requirements. Some
of the requirements state that these investments be managed
independently by a prudent fund manager and that funds are to be
invested in conservative, minimum risk investment securities.
Any gains or losses are anticipated to be refunded to or
collected from customers, respectively.
3. Financial and Performance Guarantees
On a limited basis, NSTAR and certain of its subsidiaries may
enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third
parties. Such agreements include letters of credit, surety
bonds, and other guarantees. At December 31, 2002, outstanding guarantees totaled $342
million as follows:
in thousands
Letters of Credit       $ 5,527
Surety Bonds           15,709
Other Guarantees         13,000
Total Guarantees     $ 34,236
The $55 million letter of credit is for the benefit of a third
party, as trustee in connection with the 6924% Notes of one of
its subsidiaries. The letter of credit is available if its
subsidiary has insufficient funds to pay the debt service
requirements. As of December 31, 2002, there have been no
amounts drawn under this letter of credit.
At December 31, 2002, certain of NSTAR subsidiaries have
purchased a total of $1 million of performance surety bonds for
the purpose of obtaining licenses, permits and rights-of-way in
various municipalities. In addition, NSTAR has purchased
approximately $147 million in worker compensation self-insurer
bonds. These bonds support the guarantee by NSTAR to the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts required as part of NSTAR
worker compensation self-insurance program.
NSTAR and its subsidiaries have also issued $13 million of
residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the
Hydro-Quebec transmission companies.
Management believes the likelihood NSTAR would be required to
perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with
any of these guarantees is remote.
4. Environmental Matters
As of December 31, 2002, NSTAR subsidiaries were involved in 21
state-regulated properties Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or
MCP sites where oil or other hazardous materials were
previously spilled or released. On February 4, 2003, NSTAR
closed-out one of these sites and filed the required information
with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection.
The NSTAR subsidiaries are required to clean up or otherwise
remediate these properties in accordance with specific state
regulations. There are uncertainties associated with the
remediation costs due to the final selection of the specific
cleanup technology and the particular characteristics of the
different sites. In addition to the MCP sites, NSTAR
subsidiaries also face possible liability as a result of
involvement in multi-party disposal sites or third party claims
associated with contamination remediation. NSTAR generally
expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential
liability for these sites. Estimates of approximately $42
million and $58 million are included as liabilities in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, and are the total amount of NSTAR estimated
environmental clean-up obligations. Accordingly, this amount has
not been reduced by any potential rate recovery treatment of
these costs or any potential recovery from NSTAR insurance
carriers. Prospectively, should NSTAR be allowed regulatory rate
recovery of these specific costs, it would record an offsetting
regulatory asset and record a credit to operating expenses equal
to previously expensed costs. Based on its assessments of the
specific site circumstances, management does not believe that it
is probable that any such additional costs will have a material
impact on NSTAR consolidated financial position.
NSTAR Gas is participating in the assessment of six former
manufactured gas plant MGP sites and alleged MGP waste disposal
locations to determine if and to what extent such sites have been
contaminated and whether NSTAR Gas may be responsible for
remedial action. The MDTE has approved recovery of costs
associated with MGP sites over a 7-year period, without carrying
costs. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, NSTAR Gas has recorded
a liability of $48 million and $67 million, respectively, as an
estimate for site cleanup costs for several MGP sites for which
NSTAR Gas was previously cited as a potentially responsible
party. A corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded that
reflects the future rate recovery for these costs.
Estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed
and adjusted periodically as further investigation and assignment
of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are
identified or NSTAR responsibilities for such sites evolve or
are resolved. NSTAR ultimate liability for future
environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates.
Although, in view of NSTAR current assessment of its
environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements and
regulatory policies, management does not believe that these
matters will have a material adverse effect on NSTAR
consolidated financial position or results of operations for a
reporting period.
5. Regulatory and Legal Proceedings
a. Regulatory proceedings
In December 2002, NSTAR Electric filed proposed transition rate
adjustments for 2003, including a preliminary reconciliation of
transition, transmission, standard offer and default service
costs and revenues through 2002. The MDTE subsequently approved
tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective January 1,
2003. The filings were updated in February 2003 to include final
costs and revenues for 2002.
On November 14, 2002, Boston Edison and the AG received approval
of a Settlement Agreement from the MDTE resolving issues in
Boston Edison reconciliation of costs and revenues for the year
2001. Among other issues, the Settlement Agreement includes an
adjustment relating to the reconciliation of costs relating to
securitization and efforts to mitigate costs incurred in relation
to a purchased power agreement with Hydro Quebec. As a result of
this Settlement Agreement with the AG, Boston Edison recognized
approximately $114 million in additional transition charge
revenues in 2002. This benefit was significantly offset by
several other regulatory true-up adjustments.
In December 2001, NSTAR Electric filed proposed transition rate
adjustments for 2002, including a preliminary reconciliation of
costs and revenues through 2001. The MDTE subsequently approved
tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective January 1,
2002. The filings were updated in February 2002 to include final
costs for 2001. The MDTE approved the reconciliation of costs
and revenues for Boston Edison through 2000 in its approval on
November 16, 2001 of a Settlement Agreement between Boston Edison
and the AG resolving all outstanding issues in Boston Edison
prior reconciliation filings. As a part of this settlement,
Boston Edison agreed to reduce the costs sought to be collected
through the transition charge by approximately $29 million as
compared to the amounts that were originally sought. This
settlement did not have a material adverse effect on NSTAR
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.
On June 1, 2001, the MDTE issued its final orders on the
reconciliation of ComElectric and Cambridge Electric
transition, standard offer service, default service and
transmission costs and revenues for 1998. ComElectric and
Cambridge Electric reached a settlement with the AG regarding the
1999 and 2000 reconciliation proceedings. Under this settlement,
the companies' future recovery of transition costs would be
reduced by approximately $78 million. This settlement was
approved by the MDTE on June 5, 2002 and did not have a material
adverse effect on NSTAR 2002 consolidated financial position,
cash flows or results of operations.
b. Merger Rate Plan
On December 16, 2002, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
SJC affirmed the MDTE 1999 decision to allow for the merger
of BEC and COM/Energy as originally structured. The SJC decision
finalized the resolution of all issues relating to this appeal
and did not have any impact on NSTAR 2002 or prior periods'
consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of
operations. The 1999 MDTE order, which approved the rate plan
associated with the merger, was appealed to the SJC by the
Massachusetts Attorney General AG and a separate group that
consisted of The Energy Consortium TEC and Harvard University
Harvard. The AG, TEC and Harvard alleged that, in approving
the rate plan and merger proposal, the MDTE committed errors of
law in the following areas: 1 in adopting a public interest
standard, the MDTE applied the wrong standard of review, and
failed to investigate the propriety of rates and to determine
that the resulting rates of Boston Edison, Cambridge Electric,
ComElectric and NSTAR Gas were just and reasonable; 2 that in
permitting Cambridge Electric and ComElectric to adjust their
rates by $498 million to reflect demand-side management costs,
the MDTE failed to determine whether such an adjustment was
warranted in light of other cost decreases; 3 that the MDTE
approval results in an arbitrary and unjustified sharing of
benefits and costs between ratepayers and shareholders; and 4
that the MDTE approval of the rate plan guarantees shareholders
recovery of future costs without any future demonstration of
customer savings. The AG brief included similar arguments in
each of these areas and added that, in allowing recovery of the
acquisition premium, the MDTE improperly deviated from a cost
basis in setting approved rates and the ratemaking policies in
other jurisdictions.
c. Other Legal Matters
In the normal course of its business, NSTAR and its subsidiaries
are involved in certain legal matters, including civil lawsuits.
Management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably
possible court-ordered damages, settlement amounts, and related
litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of
amounts accrued. Based on the information currently available,
NSTAR does not believe that it is probable that any such
additional legal liability will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial position. However, it is reasonably
possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from
changes in estimates could have a material impact on its results
of operations for a reporting period.
