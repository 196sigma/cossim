REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Viewpoint Corporation
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Viewpoint Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION
Viewpoint Corporation, a Delaware corporation Viewpoint or the
Company is focused on providing complete end-to-end solutions for creating
and deploying virtual products centered on the Company Viewpoint Experience
Technology for e-commerce and the Web environment.
Until December 1999, the Company was primarily engaged in the development,
marketing, and sales of prepackaged software graphics products. Its principal
products were computer graphics painting tools and photo imaging software
products. With its acquisition of Real Time Geometry Corporation in December
1996, however, the Company became involved, on a limited basis, in the
development of technologies designed to make practical the efficient display and
deployment of rich media on the Internet.
In June 1999, the Company increased its commitment to the development of
rich media internet technologies and formed Metastream.com Corporation
Metastream to operate a business exploiting these technologies. The Company
originally held an 80% equity interest in Metastream with Computer Associates
International, Inc. Computer Associates holding the remaining 20% equity
interest.
In December 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a plan to
focus exclusively on the internet technologies of its majority-owned subsidiary
and to correspondingly divest the Company of all its prepackaged software
business. By April 2000, the Company had sold substantially all of its
prepackaged software product lines.
In September 2000, the Company acquired Viewpoint Digital, Inc. Viewpoint
Digital, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates. Viewpoint Digital
publishes the world largest library of 3D digital content and provides
creative 3D services to thousands of customers in entertainment, advertising,
visual simulation, computer-based training and corporate communications.
Inherent in the Company business are various risks and uncertainties,
including its limited operating history in the e-commerce visualization business
and the limited history of commerce on the Web. In addition, the Company has
sustained losses from continuing operations for the last four years and has an
accumulated deficit at December 31, 2000. The Company future prospects are
highly dependent on its ability to keep pace with its competitors' innovations;
to adapt to new operating systems, hardware platforms and emerging industry
standards; and to provide additional functionality to the Company existing
products and technologies. The Company success depends on its ability to
develop and introduce such products and technologies in a timely manner, the
acceptance of the Company products and technologies by the marketplace and its
ability to generate license and service revenues from the use of its products
and technologies on the Web.
The Company believes that its current cash and marketable securities
balances and cash provided by future operations, if any, are sufficient to meet
its operating cash flow needs and anticipated capital expenditure requirements
through at least the next twelve months. In addition, the Company may pursue
additional debt or equity financing to augment their working capital position;
however, there can be no assurance that the Company can obtain financing at
terms acceptable to the Company.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Viewpoint and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. Accordingly, revenue
from software arrangements involving multiple elements e.g., software products,
upgrades/enhancements, post contract customer support, etc. is allocated
33
35
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements. The
determination of fair value is based on objective evidence, which is specific to
the Company.
Service revenue, which consists of fees for professional services, is
recognized as the services are performed or, if no pattern of performance is
discernible, on a straight-line basis over the period during which the services
are performed.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which gives additional guidance in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in the financial statements. The
Company was in compliance with the provisions of SAB No. 101.
With respect to its discontinued prepackaged graphics software business
Note 3, the Company recognized product revenue when contractual obligations
were satisfied, title and risk of loss had been transferred to the customer and
collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured. The Company
provided an allowance for estimated returns at the time of product delivery and
adjusted this allowance as needed based on actual return history. Such reserves
as a percentage of net revenues varied over recent years, reflecting the
Company experience in product returns as it had significantly expanded the
proportion of its sales through third-party distribution channels and increased
its product portfolio. The Company agreements with its distributors provided
the distributors with limited rights to return unsold inventories under a stock
balancing program.
With respect to its discontinued prepackaged graphics software business
Note 3, the Company entered into agreements whereby it licensed products to
original equipment manufacturers OEM and foreign publishers, which
provided such customers the right to produce and distribute multiple copies of
its software. Nonrefundable fixed fees were recognized as revenue at delivery of
the product master to the customer, satisfaction of Company obligations, if any,
and reasonable assurance regarding the collectability of the corresponding
receivable. Per copy royalties in excess of fixed amounts were recognized as
revenue when such amounts exceeded fixed minimum royalties.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed, the Company provides for capitalization of certain software
development costs once technological feasibility is established. The costs
capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated product
life, or on the ratio of current revenue to total projected product revenues,
whichever is greater. To date, the establishment of technological feasibility of
the Company products and general release have substantially coincided. As a
result, the Company has not capitalized any internal software development costs
since costs qualifying for such capitalization have not been significant.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE
In accordance with SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company capitalizes costs
of software, consulting services, hardware and payroll-related costs incurred to
purchase or develop internal-use software, when technological feasibility has
been established, it is probable that the project will be completed and the
software will be used as intended. The Company expenses costs incurred during
preliminary project assessment, research and development, re-engineering,
training and application maintenance.
In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on EITF Issue 00-02, Accounting
for Web Site Development Costs. This consensus provides guidance on what types
of costs incurred to develop web sites should be capitalized or expensed. The
34
36
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Company adopted this consensus on July 1, 2000. The Company policy for
accounting for costs incurred to operate the Company web site was not impacted
by the adoption of the pronouncement.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method as
required by SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Under APB No. 25, compensation
expense is recognized over the vesting period based on the difference, if any,
at the date of grant between the fair value of the Company stock and the
exercise price. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18 Accounting for Equity
Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in
Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Financial
Interpretation FIN No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation, which is an interpretation of APB No. 25. This
interpretation clarifies   - The definition of employee for purposes of applying APB No. 25, which
deals with stock compensation issues   - The criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a non
compensatory plan   - The accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a
previously fixed stock option or award; and
- The accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination.
The adoption of FIN No. 44 did not have a material impact on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less at date of acquisition to be cash
equivalents.
The Company considers its marketable securities portfolio
available-for-sale as defined in SFAS No. 115 Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These available-for-sale securities
are accounted for at their fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on these
securities are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. At
December 31, 2000 and 1999, net unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities were approximately $12,000 and $69,000,
respectively.
The Company invests its cash in accordance with a policy that seeks to
maximize returns while ensuring both liquidity and minimal risk of principal
loss. The policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by
institutions with investment grade credit ratings, and places restrictions on
maturities and concentration by type and issuer. The majority of the Company
portfolio is composed of fixed income securities that are subject to the risk of
market interest rate fluctuations, and all of the Company marketable
35
37
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
securities are subject to risks associated with the ability of the issuers to
perform their obligations under the instruments.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Assets are depreciated on the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 7
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the
lease or the life of the asset. Upon sale, any gain or loss is included in the
consolidated statements of operations. Maintenance and minor replacements are
expensed as incurred.
LONG-TERM ASSETS
The Company continually reviews the carrying value of long-term assets,
primarily consisting of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible
assets to determine whether there are any indications of impairment losses.
Impairment losses, if any, are recorded when the expected undiscounted future
operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying
value.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The functional currency of each of the Company foreign subsidiaries is
its local currency. Financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are
translated to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using current rates of
exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates of exchange for revenues
and expenses. The effects of currency translation adjustments are included as a
component of other comprehensive income loss in the statement of stockholders'
equity. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions for 2000, 1999 and
1998 were not significant.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION OF RISK
The Company is subject to concentration of credit risk and interest rate
risk related to cash equivalents and marketable securities. Credit risk is
managed by limiting the amount of marketable securities placed with any one
issuer, investing in high-quality marketable securities and securities of the
U.S. government and limiting the average maturity of the overall portfolio. At
December 31, 2000, and periodically from 1998 through 2000, the Company has
maintained balances with various financial institutions in excess of the
federally insured limits.
Carrying amounts of financial instruments held by the Company, which
include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value.
NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and diluted net loss per common share is
computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
equivalent shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares related to stock options
are excluded from the computation when their effect is antidilutive.
36
38
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
COMPREHENSIVE LOSS
In accordance with SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, all
components of comprehensive income, including net income loss, are reported in
the financial statements in the period in which they are recognized.
Comprehensive income loss is defined as the change in equity during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net
income loss and other comprehensive income loss, are reported net of their
related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income loss.
STOCK SALES BY SUBSIDIARY
Gains realized on stock sales by Metastream are recorded in the Company
consolidated statements of operations, except for any transaction which may be
credited directly to equity in accordance with the provisions of SAB No. 51,
Accounting for Sales of Stock of a Subsidiary.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1999 and 1998 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 2000 presentation.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which
established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and
hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2000. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those
instruments at fair value. To date, the Company has not engaged in derivative
and hedging activities.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In December 1999, the Board of Directors approved a plan to focus
exclusively on its patented e-commerce visualization solutions, and to
correspondingly divest itself of all its prepackaged graphics software business.
Accordingly, these operations are reflected as discontinued operations for all
periods presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
The loss on disposal of discontinued operations, which totaled
approximately $21,260,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, consisted of the
estimated future results of operations of the discontinued business through the
estimated date of divestiture, the amounts expected to be realized upon the sale
of the discontinued business, severance and related benefits, and asset
write-downs see table below. The Company recorded an adjustment to net loss on
disposal of discontinued operations of $1,496,000 during the year ended December
31, 2000, primarily as a result of better than expected net revenues during the
year from the discontinued business. During April 2000, the Company completed
the sale of a substantial portion of the Company graphics software product
lines. Specifically, Corel Corporation acquired MetaCreations' Painter, Kai
Power Tools, KPT Vector Effects and Bryce product lines; egi.sys AG acquired the
Poser product line; and fractal.com Corporation acquired the Headline Studio
product line for total consideration of $11,250,000, consisting of cash and
promissory notes, plus future royalties. At December 31, 2000, $4,000,000 was
still outstanding and is classified as a current asset of discontinued
operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The provision for
loss on disposal of discontinued operations is an estimate and subject to
change. Changes in estimates will be accounted for prospectively and included in
income loss from discontinued operations.

4. RESTRUCTURING
On June 30, 1998, the Company announced a restructuring plan aimed at
reducing costs and improving competitiveness and efficiency, which was
implemented during the third quarter of 1998. In connection with the
restructuring, management considered the Company future operating costs and
levels of revenue in 1998 and beyond, and determined that a restructuring charge
of approximately $4,955,000 was required to cover the
39
41
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
costs of reducing certain sectors of its workforce and facilities. The
restructuring charge included an accrual of approximately $2,208,000 related to
severance and benefits associated with the reduction of approximately 75
positions during July 1998, as well as the related reduction of certain of the
Company facilities. Non-cash restructuring costs, which totaled approximately
$2,747,000, primarily related to the write-down of non-strategic business assets
made redundant or obsolete due to the streamlining of the Company product
lines and/or reduction of facilities. The restructuring plan was completed
during the first quarter of 1999. The restructuring charge has been included
within discontinued operations in the Company consolidated statements of
operations.

ACQUISITIONS
VIEWPOINT DIGITAL
On September 8, 2000, the Company purchased all the outstanding capital
stock of Viewpoint Digital, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Computer Associates.
The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
purchase price of $19,169,000, excluding contingent consideration of $30,000,000
in notes payable, consisted of 715,000 shares of the Company common stock
valued at $8,938,000, cash consideration of $10,000,000 and $231,000 in direct
acquisitions costs. The contingent consideration consists of two promissory
notes each in the amount of $15,000,000. Both notes are contingent upon the
achievement of certain levels of future operating results and employee retention
through April 30, 2002. The purchase price in excess of the value of tangible
assets and liabilities assumed of $2,130,000, has been allocated as follows 3,253,000 to a covenant not to compete, $3,180,000 to work force, $1,558,000 to
technology, $1,203,000 to customer list, $963,000 to in-process research and
development, $643,000 to tradename and $6,239,000 to goodwill. Goodwill and
other intangibles, excluding in-process research and development, will be
amortized over their expected periods of benefit, which ranges from 15 to 4
years. Amortization expense of $1,980,000 was recorded for the year ended
December 31, 2000. In-process research and development was written off during
the month of September 2000. The operating results of Viewpoint Digital have
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the
date of acquisition.
RAYFLECT S.A.
On June 29, 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of RAYflect S.A.
RAYflect, a privately held company based in France that developed and
marketed 3D graphic design tools for professionals. The acquisition was
accounted for by the Company under the purchase method of accounting. Under the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, the stockholders of RAYflect received 125,996
shares of the Company common stock valued at approximately $597,000 at June
29, 1999, the closing date, and cash consideration totaling $622,000. The
purchase price of approximately $1,277,000 was capitalized by the Company as
goodwill and was being amortized over 3 years. At December 31, 1999, the Company
wrote off the remaining goodwill related to the RAYflect acquisition, to
discontinued operations. The operating results of RAYflect have been included in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition
and classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

CANOMA, INC.
On December 31, 1998, the Company completed the acquisition of Canoma, Inc.
Canoma, a privately held development-stage software company based in
Northern California, that was developing software technology that creates 3D
digital images and content from 2D digital images for use primarily over the
Internet and in other applications. The acquisition was accounted for by the
Company under the purchase method of accounting. Under the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, the stockholders of Canoma received 300,000 shares of the Company
common stock valued at approximately $1,305,000 at December 31, 1998, the
closing date, and cash consideration totaling $1,750,000. As of December 31,
1998, neither technological feasibility nor commercial viability had been
reached with regard to Canoma technology or potential products. Based upon
projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted using a 33% discount rate, Canoma
in-process technology was valued at approximately $2,250,000, which, including
acquisition costs totaling approximately $100,000, resulted in a one time charge
to earnings of approximately $2,350,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998.
The remaining purchase price of approximately $805,000 was capitalized by the
Company as goodwill and acquired technology and was being amortized over 5
years. At December 31, 1999, the Company wrote off the remaining goodwill
related to the Canoma acquisition, to discontinued operations. The operating
results of Canoma have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition and classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented.
6. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SUBSIDIARY
In June 2000, Metastream issued 1,500,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock to America Online, Inc. AOL for cash consideration totaling
$10,000,000. Prior to the merger of the Company and Metastream Note 7, each
share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was exchanged by the Company, into
1,725,000 shares of the Company common stock. In connection with the issuance
of the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to AOL and the
simultaneous execution of a licensing and distribution arrangement, the Company
recorded a one-time non-cash sales and marketing charge of $5,740,000 related to
the difference between the fair value of the Company common shares into which
AOL could have converted the preferred shares on the date of issuance, and the
$10,000,000 cash consideration paid by AOL.
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by AOL also contained a put
right whereby AOL could have required the Company to purchase the preferred
shares, unless exchanged, at a price equal to the original purchase price paid
by AOL, plus interest.
In July 2000, Metastream issued 1,500,000 shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock to Adobe Systems Incorporated Adobe for cash consideration
totaling $10,000,000. Prior to the merger of the Company and Metastream Note
7, each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock was exchanged by the
Company, into 1,725,000 shares of Company common stock. In connection with the

right whereby Adobe could have required the Company to purchase the preferred
shares, unless exchanged, at a price equal to the original purchase price paid
by Adobe, plus interest.
Accretion for these mandatorily redeemable securities totaled $438,000
prior to the date the preferred stock was exchanged for Company common stock.
7. AGREEMENTS WITH COMPUTER ASSOCIATES AND MINORITY INTEREST
Beginning in June 1999, the Company entered into a series of agreements
with Computer Associates. The agreements included a non-exclusive limited-use
perpetual license to use the Company 3D related technologies and a
41
43
VIEWPOINT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
service agreement whereby the Company would provide a defined number of
development personnel to Computer Associates on an as needed basis. Concurrent
with the license agreement, the Company also granted Computer Associates a 20%
equity interest in Metastream, for certain non-monetary support as
consideration. The Company concluded that the series of transactions with
Computer Associates should be viewed in the aggregate and the monetary
consideration allocated to each component based on their fair values. Since the
limited-use license of related technologies was a unique, one-time transaction,
the Company did not have the requisite evidence of its fair value pursuant to
the provisions of SOP No. 97-2. An independent valuation of the 20% interest in
Metastream indicated a fair value in excess of the monetary consideration
ascribed to Computer Associates limited-use licensing rights; therefore, the
Company concluded the appropriate recognition for the transactions was to
allocate the committed monetary consideration to the equity component. The
Company allocated the consideration received of $7,000,000 between minority
interest and change in interest gain pursuant to the provisions of SAB No. 51.
The change in interest gain has been recorded to paid-in capital in the
Company consolidated balance sheets.
For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and earnings of
Metastream are included in the Company consolidated financial statements.
Computer Associates' and another minority shareholder combined 20% interest in
Metastream was recorded as minority interest in the Company consolidated
balance sheets, and the losses allocable to their 20% interest have been
reported as minority interest in the Company consolidated statements of
operations.
In connection with the grant of stock options in Metastream to certain
employees and non-employee directors, the Company recorded total deferred
compensation of approximately $24,206,000 and $16,811,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. This deferred compensation represented
the difference between the fair value of Metastream common stock and the
exercise price of these options at the date of grant. Minority interest in the
Company consolidated balance sheets was credited with its proportionate
interest in stock-based compensation expense that was recognized through
November 30, 2000.
On August 10, 2000, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with
Computer Associates pursuant to which the Company issued to Computer Associates
115 shares of the Company common stock in exchange for each share of common
stock of Metastream held by Computer Associates. On consummation of the share
exchange in November 2000, Computer Associates exchanged its 4,800,000 shares of
Metastream common stock for 5,520,000 newly issued shares of Company common
stock.
The consideration paid by the Company in connection with the exchange
approximated $57,087,000, consisting of the following   - The issuance of 5,520,000 shares of Company common stock valued at $1025
per common share, which was the average market price of the Company
common stock for the two trading days before and after August 10, 2000,
for equity consideration of $56,580,000; and
- Transaction costs of $507,000.
The exchange of shares was accounted for as an acquisition of minority
interest under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase
price was allocated to goodwill, net of the carrying value of Computer
Associates' minority interest. The goodwill recorded is being amortized over
four years.
On completion of the share exchange with Computer Associates and the
preferred stock exchanges with AOL and Adobe Note 6, the Company owned 998%
of the outstanding capital stock of Metastream. The other shareholder holding an
interest in Metastream was a former director of the Company who was issued and
subsequently exercised an option to purchase 50,000 shares of Metastream common
stock. This shareholder shares were exchanged for 57,500 newly issued shares
of Company common stock, which was accounted for as an acquisition of minority
interest under the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the purchase
price of $270,000 was allocated to goodwill, net of the carrying value of this
shareholder minority interest. The goodwill recorded will be amortized over
four years.
Amortization expense related to the acquisitions of minority interest
totaled $894,000 for the year ended December 31, 2000.

$18,433,000 and $17,509,000 during 2000 and 1999, respectively, providing a full
valuation allowance against the Company net deferred tax assets. The Company
net deferred tax assets include substantial amounts of net operating loss
carryforwards. Inability to generate taxable income within the carryforward
period would affect the ultimate realizability of such assets. Consequently,
management determined that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the
realizability of these assets to warrant the establishment of the full valuation
allowance. Management assessment with respect to the amount of deferred tax
assets considered realizable may be revised over the near term based on actual
operating results and revised financial statement projections.
At December 31, 2000, the Company has net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $107,646,000 and $2,175,000, respectively, for
federal income tax purposes, which begin expiring in 2011. The Company federal
net operating loss carryforward relates to the Company acquisitions of RTG and
Specular and the net losses incurred by the Company during the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. The Company also has net operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards for state income tax purposes, which begin expiring in
2001. The Company state net operating loss carryforward primarily relates to
the net losses incurred by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998. Additionally, the Company has net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $10,690,000 and $211,000, respectively, for
foreign income tax purposes, which do not expire. The Company foreign net
operating loss carryforward relates to net losses incurred by the Company
subsidiary in Ireland during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997
which have been included in discontinued operations. The net operating loss
carryforwards may be used to offset any future taxable income, subject to
potential limitations on the Company ability to utilize such loss
carryforwards pursuant to the ownership rule changes of the Internal Revenue
Code, Section 382.
