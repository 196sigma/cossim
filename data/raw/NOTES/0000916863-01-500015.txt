ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
WPSRESOURCES CORPORATION
E. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Nature of Operations--WPSResources
Corporation is a holding company. Our primary wholly-owned subsidiary,
WisconsinPublicService Corporation, is an electric and gas utility.
WisconsinPublicService supplies and distributes electric power and
natural gas in its franchised service territory in northeastern Wisconsin and an
adjacent portion of the UpperPeninsula of Michigan. Our other wholly-owned
utility subsidiary, UpperPeninsula Power Company, is an electric utility.
UpperPeninsula Power supplies and distributes electric energy in the
UpperPeninsula of Michigan. Another wholly-owned subsidiary,
WPSResources Capital Corporation, is a holding company for our
nonregulated businesses, WPS Energy Services, Inc. and WPS Power Development,
Inc. WPSEnergy Services is a diversified energy supply and services
company. WPSPower Development develops, owns and operates, through its own
subsidiaries, electric generation projects.
The term utility refers to the regulated
activities of WisconsinPublicService and UpperPeninsula Power,
while the term nonutility refers to the activities of
WisconsinPublicService and UpperPeninsula Power which are not
regulated. The term nonregulated refers to activities other than
those of WisconsinPublicService and UpperPeninsula Power.
b Use of Estimates--We prepare our financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. We make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
These estimates and assumptions include assets, liabilities, the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
c Accounting for Price Risk Management--Effective
January 1,2001, WPS Resources adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, Statement No. 133 as
amended by Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 137 and 138.
Statement No. 133 normalizes accounting and financial reporting standards for
forward contracts, futures, options, and other derivative instruments, and
related hedging activities. Statement No133 requires, in part, that we
report all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities
at their fair value. The treatment of subsequent changes in fair value are
recorded currently in earnings unless certain hedge accounting criteria are met
or if the derivatives are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulation Statement 71.
Although all of WPS Resources' subsidiaries adopted
Statement No. 133, instruments utilized by WPS Energy Services in connection
with price risk management activities are accounted for using the mark-to-market
method of accounting as prescribed by the Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
98-10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities. In the first quarter of 2000, WPS Energy Services
classified all of its unaffiliated energy contracts and gas in storage as
trading operations. Under the mark-to-market method of accounting, the
unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as Price Risk
Management Assets and Liabilities on the balance sheet. Changes in the market
value of these assets and liabilities and gas in storage are recorded in
operations on the income statement and result primarily from changes in the
valuation of the portfolio of contracts, newly originated transactions, and the
timing of settlement relative to the receipt of cash for certain contracts. The
market prices used to value these transactions reflect management best
estimate considering various factors including exchange and over-the-counter
market closing quotations, time value, and volatility factors underlying the
commitments. Contracts entered into with other subsidiaries at WPS Resources and
the related hedged commitments are not classified as trading contracts and
continue to be accounted for at cost.
d Income Taxes--We account for income taxes using
the liability method as prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the
liability method, deferred income tax liabilities are established for all
temporary differences in the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities based
upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes
become payable.
e Property, Plant, and Equipment--Utility
plant is stated at the original cost of construction which includes an allowance
for funds used during construction. The cost of renewals and betterments of
units of property as distinguished from minor items of property is capitalized
as an addition to the utility plant accounts. Except for land, no gain or loss
is recognized in connection with ordinary retirements of utility property units.
The utility charges the cost of units of property retired, sold, or otherwise
disposed of, plus removal, less salvage, to the accumulated provision for
depreciation. Maintenance, repair, replacement, and renewal costs associated
with items not qualifying as units of property are part of operating expenses.
We capitalize certain costs related to software developed
or obtained for internal use and amortize those costs to operating expense over
the estimated useful life of the related software.
Nonutility property interest capitalization takes place
during construction and gain and loss recognition occurs in connection with
retirements. Nonregulated property, plant, and equipment are capitalized at
original cost. Significant additions or improvements that extend asset lives are
capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
f Allowance for Funds Used During Construction--Approximately
50% of WisconsinPublicService retail jurisdictional construction
work in progress expenditures are subject to allowance for funds used during
construction. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin is allowing accrual of
allowance for funds used during construction on 100% of the Kewaunee plant
steam generator replacement project. For 2000, Wisconsin Public Service retail
rate allowance for funds used during construction was approximately 106%.
Historically, UpperPeninsula Power construction work in progress
expenditures have not been subject to retail jurisdictional allowance for funds
used during construction due to their small dollar amounts. We expect larger
projects to occur in the future that will be subject to retail jurisdictional
allowance for funds used during construction.
Wholesale jurisdictional electric allowance for funds used
during construction is recorded on Wisconsin PublicService and
UpperPeninsula Power construction work in progress at debt and equity
percentages specified in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Uniform
System of Accounts. For 2000, the allowance for funds used during construction
wholesale rate was approximately 74% for WisconsinPublic Service and 89%
for UpperPeninsula Power.
g 
accounts for the agreement to purchase power from De Pere Energy Center, LLC as
a capital lease. On June14, 1999, WisconsinPublicService
recorded a leased asset and a lease obligation equal to the present value of the
minimum lease payments. The leased asset is depreciated over 25 years, the life
of the contract.
h Depreciation--We record straight-line
depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of utility property and
include amounts for estimated removal and salvage. Depreciation rates for
WisconsinPublic Service were approved by the PublicService
Commission of Wisconsin effective January1, 1999.
Depreciation rates for UpperPeninsula Power were
approved by the MichiganPublicService Commission on January1,
1994 and remain in effect through 2001. A new depreciation study will be filed
with the MichiganPublic Service Commission in early 2001. A final rate
order is expected in 2001.
Depreciation for the Kewaunee plant is being accrued based
on a 1997 Public Service Commission of Wisconsin order. The order allows for
full cost recovery by the end of 2002. The Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin rate order that became effective on January1,2001 includes
a change in the methodology for the Kewaunee plant after the steam generators
have been replaced. Under this order, existing net plant at
January1,2001 will be recovered using a straight-line remaining life
method, with full recovery to be realized by the end of April2010. The
cost of new steam generators, estimated to be in service by November2001,
will be recovered over an 8-1/2 year period using the sum-of-years-digits method
of depreciation.
Depreciation expense also includes accruals for nuclear
decommissioning. These accruals are not included in the annual composite rates
shown below. An explanation of this item is included in Note 1j.

i Nuclear Fuel--The quantity of heat produced for
the generation of electric energy by the Kewaunee plant is the basis for the
amortization of the costs of nuclear fuel to electric production fuel expense
including an amount for ultimate disposal. Recovery of these costs occurs
currently from customers in rates. The ultimate storage of fuel is handled by
the United States Department of Energy pursuant to a contract required by the
Nuclear Waste Act of 1982. The Department of Energy receives quarterly payments
for the storage of fuel based on generation. Spent nuclear fuel storage space is
provided at the Kewaunee plant on an interim basis. Expenses associated with
interim spent fuel storage at the Kewaunee plant are recognized as current
operating costs. With minor plant modifications planned for 2001, the Kewaunee
plant should have sufficient fuel storage capacity until the end of its useful
life in 2013. At December31,2000, the accumulated provision for
nuclear fuel totaled $1677million compared with $1627 million at
December31, 1999.
j Nuclear Decommissioning--Our share of nuclear
decommissioning costs to date has been accrued over the estimated service life
of the Kewaunee plant, recovered currently from customers in rates, and
deposited in external trusts. Such costs totaled $89 million in 2000, $92
million in 1999, and $172million in 1998. The 1998-2000 funding levels
used a recovery period ending in 2002 as described in Note1h,
Depreciation. Beginning in 2001, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has
authorized use of a funding period ending in 2010. As a result of this
extension, the contributions for 2001 will be $26million.
Based on the standard cost escalation assumptions required
by a July1994 Public Service Commission of Wisconsin order, the
undiscounted amount of Wisconsin Public Service share of decommissioning costs
forecasted to be expended between the years 2013 and 2043 is $6752million
under the revised funding plan which became effective in 1999. In developing the
funding plan, a long-term after-tax earnings rate of approximately 53% was
assumed.
Wisconsin Public Service share of the Kewaunee plant
decommissioning based on a 412% ownership interest is estimated to be $2114
million in current dollars based on a site-specific study. The study, which was
performed in 1998, uses immediate dismantlement as the method of decommissioning
and assumes shutdown in 2013. As of December31,2000, the market
value of the external nuclear decommissioning trusts totaled
$2072million.
Depreciation expense includes future decommissioning costs
collected in customer rates and an offsetting charge for earnings from external
trusts. As of December31,2000, the accumulated provision for
depreciation and decommissioning included accumulated provisions for
decommissioning totaling $2072million. Realized trust earnings totaled
$108million in 2000, $46million in 1999, and $33million in
1998. Unrealized gains, net of tax, in external trusts are reflected as an
increase to the decommissioning reserve, since decommissioning expense will be
recognized as the gains are realized, in accordance with regulatory
requirements.
Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts are
recorded at market value. Investments at December31,2000, consisted
of 514% equity securities and 486% fixed income securities. The investments
classified as utility plant are presented net of related income tax effects on
unrealized gains and represent the amount of assets available to accomplish
decommissioning. The nonqualified trust investments designated to pay income
taxes when unrealized gains become realized are classified as other assets. An
offsetting regulatory liability reflects the expected reduction in future rates
as unrealized gains in the nonqualified trust are realized. Information
regarding the cost and market value of the external nuclear decommissioning
trusts is set forth below

k Cash and Equivalents--We consider short-term
investments with anoriginal maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.
l Revenue and Customer Receivables--We accrue
estimated amounts for electric and gas service rendered but not billed.
Approximately 88% of our total revenue is from companies in the paper products
industry.
WisconsinPublicService and
UpperPeninsula Power use automatic fuel adjustment clauses for the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission wholesale-electric and the
MichiganPublicService Commission retail-electric portions of the
business.
The Wisconsin retail-electric portion of
WisconsinPublicService business uses a cost variance
range approach, based on a specific estimated fuel cost for the forecast
year. If WisconsinPublic Service actual fuel costs fall outside this
range, a hearing can be held resulting in an adjustment to future rates.
The PublicService Commission of Wisconsin has
approved a modified one-for-one gas cost recovery plan for
WisconsinPublicService. Implementation of the modified one-for-one
gas cost recovery plan began in January1999. This plan allows
WisconsinPublicService to pass changes in the cost of gas purchased
from its suppliers on to system gas customers, subject to regulatory review.
Billings to UpperPeninsula Power customers under
the MichiganPublic Service Commission jurisdiction include base rate
charges and a power supply cost recovery factor. UpperPeninsula Power
receives MichiganPublicService Commission approval each year to
recover projected power supply costs by establishment of power supply cost
recovery factors. Annually the Michigan Public Service Commission reconciles
these factors to actual costs and permits 100% recovery of allowed power supply
costs. UpperPeninsula Power defers any over or under recovery on the
balance sheet. The deferrals are relieved with additional billings or refunds.
WisconsinPublicService and
UpperPeninsula Power are required to provide service and grant credit to
customers within their service territories. The two companies continually review
their customers' credit-worthiness and obtain deposits or refund deposits
accordingly. WisconsinPublicService is precluded from discontinuing
service to residential customers during certain periods of the year.
At WPS Power Development, electric power revenues related
to fixed-price contracts are recognized at the lower of amounts billable under
the contract or an amount equal to volume of the capacity made available or the
energy delivered during the period multiplied by the estimated average revenue
per kilowatt-hour per the term of the contract.
Under floating-price contracts, electric power revenues
are recognized when capacity is provided or energy is delivered.
WPS Energy Services accrues revenues in the month that
energy is delivered and/or services are rendered.
m Gas in Storage--Average cost is used to value
gas in storage used for non-trading activities. Gas in storage used for trading
activities is recorded at fair market value. Approximately 67% of the total gas
in storage at December31, 2000 was recorded at fair market value. In 1999,
none of the gas in storage was recorded at fair market value.
n Regulatory Assets and 
and UpperPeninsula Power are subject to the provisions of Statement No.
71. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain
incurred costs. Revenue will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking
process. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are refundable in future
customer rates.
o Stock Options--We issue options under our stock
option plans and account for them using the intrinsic value based method
described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees Opinion 25. The intrinsic value based method
only records compensation expense for the excess of the quoted market price of
the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock.
p Investments and Other Assets--WPS Resources
follows cost, equity, and consolidation methods of accounting for its
investments. Unless circumstances are present that lead to a different
conclusion, the following criteria are used to determine which method of
accounting is applied. The cost method of accounting is used for investments
where WPSResources owns less than 20% of the voting stock of the company,
unless other evidence indicates we have significant influence over the operating
and financial policies of the investee. If more than 20% of the voting stock is
owned, we use the equity method of accounting. This decision is made presuming
we have significant influence. When we own 50% or more of the voting stock, the
subsidiary is consolidated into our financial statements, unless our control is
temporary. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts are
eliminated. If a minority owner equity is reduced to zero, it is our policy to
record 100% of the subsidiary losses until the minority owner makes capital
contributions or commitments to fund its share of the operating costs.
q Reclassifications--We reclassified certain
prior year financial statement amounts to conform to current year presentation.
r Retirement of Debt--Amortization of gains or
losses resulting from the settlement of long-term utility debt obligations
occurred concurrently with rate recovery as required by regulators.

NOTE 3--CAPITAL LEASE
In June1999, Phase I of a 25-year power purchase
contract with DePere Energy Center, LLC became effective. We have
accounted for the contract as a capital lease. In Phase I, an initial asset and
corresponding obligation were recorded at $741 million. The asset and
obligation represent the present value of minimum lease payments. Excluded from
the payments are executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes. When
the contract expires in 2024, WisconsinPublicService may renew the
contract for two additional five-year periods with proper notice. We are
amortizing the leased asset on a straight-line basis over the original 25-year
term of the contract. The following is a schedule of future minimum lease
payments, excluding executory costs, under the DePere Energy Center

NOTE 5--LONG-TERM DEBT
At our utility subsidiaries, plant assets secure first
mortgage bonds. In December1998, WisconsinPublic Service issued
$500 million of 608% senior notes due in 2028 secured by a pledge of first
mortgage bonds. The 1998 notes become unsecured if
WisconsinPublicService retires all of its outstanding first mortgage
bonds.
WPSResources and WisconsinPublicService
are not required to make sinking fund payments on outstanding debt.
UpperPeninsula Power, however, is required to make bond sinking fund
payments for its outstanding first mortgage bonds.

make semiannual installment payments on a $240 million nonrecourse term loan
obtained in 1999 for financing the purchase of generation assets in Maine. The
assets purchased secure the loan.
In April 2000, Sunbury Generation, LLC, an indirect
subsidiary of WPSPower Development, obtained $837 million of nonrecourse
financing that is secured by the Sunbury generation plant. Quarterly payments
will be made in relation to this financing.
As of December31, 2000, WPSPower Development
drew $110million against its revolving credit note of $125million,
which is secured by the assets of the Stoneman plant. The note, which is
guaranteed by WPSResources, is due in 2003. NOTE 6--COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES
OF
SUBSIDIARY TRUST
On July30, 1998, WPSR Capital Trust I, a Delaware
business trust, issued $500 million of trust preferred securities to the
public. WPSResources owns all of the outstanding trust common securities
of the Trust, and the only asset of the Trust is $515 million of subordinated
debentures that we issued. The debentures are due on June30, 2038 and bear
interest at 7% per year. The terms and interest payments on the debentures
correspond to the terms and distributions on the trust preferred securities. We
have consolidated the preferred securities of the Trust into our financial
statements. We reflect the interest payments on the debentures as
Distributions - preferred securities of subsidiary trust. These
payments are tax deductible by WPSResources.
We may defer interest payments on the debentures for up to
20consecutive quarters. This would require the deferral of distributions
on the trust preferred securities as well. If we would defer interest payments,
interest and distributions would continue to accrue. We would also accrue
compounding interest on the deferred amounts. We may redeem all or part of the
debentures after July30, 2003. This would require the Trust to redeem an
equal amount of trust securities at face value plus any accrued interest and
unpaid distributions. We entered into a limited guarantee of payment of
distributions, redemption payments, and liquidation payments with respect to the
trust preferred securities. This guarantee, together with our obligations under
the debentures, and under other related documents, provides a full and
unconditional guarantee by us of amounts due on the outstanding trust preferred
securities. NOTE 7--COMMON EQUITY
During 2000, we purchased common stock on the open market
to meet annual requirements of our Stock Investment Plan. We also purchased
stock on the open market in connection with our stock-based employee benefit
plans. Effective January2001, we began issuing new stock for our Stock
Investment Plan and for some of our stock-based employee benefit plans.
In December1996, we adopted a Shareholder Rights
Plan. The plan is designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to
protect shareholders and the company if efforts are made to gain control of our
company in a manner that is not in our best interests or the best interests of
our shareholders. The plan gives our existing shareholders, under certain
circumstances, the right to purchase stock at a discounted price. The rights
expire on December11, 2006.
At December31, 2000, we had $3476million of
retained earnings available for dividends.
Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income
available for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income available for the period by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted for the exercise
and/or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities. Such dilutive items
include in-the-money stock options and deferred compensation plan shares. The
calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years shown excludes deferred
compensation plan shares that had an anti-dilutive effect. The following table

In 1999, shareholders approved the WPS Resources
Corporation 1999 Stock Option Plan for certain management personnel. In December
1999, the Board of Directors approved the WPS Resources Corporation 1999
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. Opinion 25 and related interpretations
are used to account for these plans. Accordingly, no compensation costs have
been recognized for these plans in 2000 or 1999. Had compensation cost been
determined consistent with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to

Under the provisions of the WPS Resources Corporation 1999
Stock Option Plan Employee Plan, the number of options granted may not exceed
15 million and no single employee can be granted options for more than 04
million shares during any five-year period. Options are granted by the
Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors and may be
granted at any time. No options may be granted after
February10,2004, under this plan. All options have a ten-year life.
The exercise price of each option is equal to the fair market value of the stock
on the date the option was granted. Options were granted on May 6,1999,
March13, 2000, and December14,2000 having exercise prices of
$29875, $231875, and $3475, respectively. One-fourth of the options granted
will become vested and exercisable each year following the year of grant on the
anniversary date of the grant.
Under the provisions of the WPS Resources Corporation 1999
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan Director Plan, the number of options
granted under the plan may not exceed 100,000. Options are granted at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. No options may be granted under this plan
after December31,2008. All options have a ten-year life, but may not
be exercised until one year after the date of grant. Options granted under this
plan are immediately vested. The exercise price of each option is equal to the
fair market value of the stock on the date the options were granted. Options
were granted on December9,1999 and February10,2000, with
exercise prices of $254375 and $256875, respectively.
The number of shares subject to each option plan and each
outstanding option, and option exercise prices are subject to adjustment in the
event of any stock split, stock dividend, or other transaction affecting our
outstanding common stock.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model assuming

remaining contractual life of 9 years. NOTE 9--FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to
estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is
practicable to estimate such value:
Cash, Short-Term Investments, Energy Conservation Loans,
Notes Payable, and Outstanding Commercial Paper: The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those investments and
obligations.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts: The value of nuclear
decommissioning trust investments is recorded at market value, net of taxes
payable on unrealized gains and losses.
Long-Term Debt, Preferred Stock, and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan Loan Guarantees: The fair value of long-term debt, preferred
stock, and Employee Stock Ownership Plan loan guarantees are estimated based on
the quoted market price for the same or similar issues or on the current rates
offered to WPSResources for debt of the same remaining maturity.

NOTE 10--PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities amended this statement in June
15, 2000. WPSResources adopted the statements as of
January1,2001. Statement No. 133 requires that every derivative
instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value and that changes in the derivative fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met.
WPS Resources has concluded that at its utility
subsidiaries and WPSPower Development the majority of its contracts for
the purchase, sale, and storage of natural gas, electricity, coal, and nuclear
fuel do not meet the definition of a derivative. Therefore, the majority of such
contracts at January1,2001 are not subject to the accounting
requirements of the new statement. Wisconsin Public Service has entered into a
limited number of commodity contracts to service its customers that meet the
definition of a derivative under StatementNo. 133. Most of these contracts
are gas purchase agreements with minimal fixed commodity price components.
Management believes any gains or losses resulting from the eventual settlement
of the gas purchase agreements will be collected from or refunded to customers
under our utilities' tariffs with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and
Michigan Public Service Commission. The derivative amounts to be recorded as a
result of these contracts will be offset with a corresponding regulatory asset
and liability pursuant to Statement No. 71. A limited number of other financial
derivative instruments are used to mitigate commodity price risk related to fuel
oil held in inventory. WPS Resources has designated these instruments as fair
value hedges of the inventory. Future changes in the fair market values of these
derivatives will be recorded directly in earnings with offsetting changes in the
value of the inventory also recorded directly in earnings. As of January1,
2001, we have recorded a derivative asset and a regulatory liability of
approximately $17 million related to our utility subsidiaries. The cumulative
effect on income was not significant.
WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial and
commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of
natural gas and electricity sold at firm prices to customers. WPS Energy
Services also utilizes derivatives to manage market risk associated with
anticipated energy purchases as well as trading activities. Derivatives may
include futures and forward contracts, price swap agreements, and call and put
options. As a result of changes in strategic focus that resulted in a shift in
customer mix, WPS Energy Services in applying Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
98-10, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk
Management Activities Issue 98-10 concluded in the first quarter of 2000
that all of its activities should be classified as trading activities. Issue
98-10 requires energy trading contracts to be recorded at fair value on the
balance sheet, with changes in fair value included in earnings. Because WPS
Energy Services marks to market its energy trading contracts in accordance with
Issue 98-10 and does not anticipate designating any derivative contracts as
hedges for accounting purposes, the adoption of Statement No. 133 is not
expected to have a material impact at WPS Energy Services. NOTE 11--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
WPS Resources has non-contributory retirement plans
covering substantially all employees under which the company may make annual
contributions to an irrevocable trust. We established the plans to provide
retired employees, who meet conditions relating to age and length of service,
with a monthly payment. Wisconsin Public Service administers and maintains the
plans. These plans are fully funded and no contributions were made to them in
2000, 1999, or 1998.
WPS Resources also currently offers medical, dental, and
life insurance benefits to employees and their dependents. We expense these
items for active employees as incurred. We fund benefits for retirees through
irrevocable trusts as allowed for income tax purposes. Wisconsin Public Service
and Upper Peninsula Power expensed and recovered through customer rates the net
periodic benefit cost. Our nonregulated subsidiaries expensed funded amounts.
Our non-administrative plan is a collectively bargained plan and, therefore, is
tax exempt. The investments in the trust covering administrative employees are
subject to federal unrelated business income taxes at a 396% tax rate.
All pension costs and postretirement plan costs are
accounted for under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 87 and
106, Employers' Accounting for Pensions and Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, respectively.
The standards require the company to accrue the cost of these benefits as
expense over the period in which the employee renders service. The transition
obligation for current and future retirees is recognized over 20 years beginning
in 1993.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of the
changes in the plan benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the
three one-year periods ending December31, 2000, 1999, and 1998, and a
statement of the funded status as of December31 for each year

During 2000, WPS
Resources made substantial changes to the administrative employees' portion of
the pension and postretirement benefit plans. Effective January 1, 2001, the
administrative employees' pension plan was changed to a pension equity plan with
a lump sum distribution option for all future retirees. Additionally, all future
administrative retirees will no longer be given subsidized postretirement
medical and dental coverage. Due to employees who waited until 2001 to retire to
take advantage of the new plan benefits and various reorganizations including
the formation of Nuclear Management Company, a significant number of employees
are leaving our pension plan in early 2001. This requires curtailment accounting
for the year 2000 under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88,
Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit
Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. Most of the 2000 curtailment
loss was deferred as a regulatory asset.

WisconsinPublicService has an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan and Trust that held 1,868,859 shares of WPSResources common
stock market value of approximately $688million at December31,
2000. The Employee Stock Ownership Plan also had a loan guaranteed by
WisconsinPublic Service and secured by common stock which was paid off in
June of 2000. The company had been paying principal and interest on the loan
using contributions from WisconsinPublicService and dividends on our
common stock held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The Employee Stock
Ownership Plan allocated shares to participants as the loan was repaid. Tax
benefits from dividends paid to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan are recognized
as a reduction in WisconsinPublicService cost of providing service
to customers. The PublicService Commission of Wisconsin has allowed
WisconsinPublicService to include in cost of service an additional
employer contribution to the plan. The net effect of the tax benefits and of the
employer contribution is an approximately equal sharing of the tax benefits of
the program between customers and employees. NOTE 12--INCOME TAXES
WPS Resources is refunding to customers taxes provided in
prior years at rates greater than current rates prospectively as the temporary
differences reverse. The regulatory liability for these refunds totaled
$252million as of December31, 2000 and $291 million as of
December31,1999, respectively.
We recognized a deferred tax asset of approximately $110
million for tax credits that will be carried forward to reduce the regular tax
liability in future years. In addition, as of December31, 2000 and 1999,
we had the following significant temporary differences that created deferred tax
assets and liabilities

NOTE 13--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Coal Contracts
To ensure a reliable, low-cost supply of coal,
WisconsinPublicService entered into a long-term contract that has
take-or-pay obligations totaling $892million from 2001 through 2016. The
obligations are subject to force majeure provisions which provide
WisconsinPublicService other options if the specified coal does not
meet emission limits that may be mandated in future legislation. We believe that
any amounts paid under the take-or-pay obligations described above would be
considered costs of service subject to recovery in customer rates.
Purchased Power
WisconsinPublicService has several take-or-pay
contracts for either capacity or energy related to purchased power. These
contracts total $872million through April2003. We expect to recover
these costs in future customer rates.
Long-Term Power Supply
In November1995, WisconsinPublicService
signed a 25-year agreement to purchase power from De Pere Energy Center, LLC, an
independent power producer, that built a cogeneration facility and is selling
electrical power to Wisconsin PublicService. Phase I of the project went
into operation in Juneof 1999 and is accounted for as a capital lease.
Phase II is currently projected to be operational within five years of the start
of PhaseI. When Phase II becomes operational, Wisconsin Public Service
will record an additional utility plant asset of approximately
$800million. See Note3, Capital Lease, for more detail.
Natural Gas Costs
WisconsinPublicService has natural gas supply
and transportation contracts that require total estimated demand payments of
$729million through October2010.
Wisconsin Public Service will acquire the natural gas
supply and transportation contracts from Wisconsin Fuel and Light Company when
the acquisition of Wisconsin Fuel and Light is completed. We expect the
acquisition to be completed in April of 2001. Because Wisconsin Public Service
and Wisconsin FuelandLight hold similar natural gas supply and
transportation contracts, the acquisition of the Wisconsin Fuel and Light
contracts is expected to have no significant impact on Wisconsin Public
Service cost of natural gas.
Nuclear Liability
The Price Anderson Act ensures that funds will be
available to pay for public liability claims arising out of a nuclear incident.
This Act may require WisconsinPublic Service to pay up to a maximum of
$363million per incident. The payments will not exceed $41million
per incident in a given calendar year. These amounts represent
WisconsinPublicService 412% ownership in the Kewaunee plant.
After Wisconsin Public Service acquires Madison Gas and
Electric share of the Kewaunee plant, our ownership will be 59%; and thus our
liabilities will increase accordingly. The maximum liability per incident will
be $520 million with payments not to exceed $59 million per incident in a
given calendar year.
Nuclear Plant Operation
On September29, 1998,
WisconsinPublicService and Madison Gas and Electric entered into an
agreement pursuant to which WisconsinPublicService will acquire, at
Madison Gas and Electric book value on the date of acquisition, Madison Gas
and Electric 178% share of the Kewaunee plant including Madison Gas and
Electric decommissioning trust assets held in their qualified trust fund.
Wisconsin Public Service will also assume Madison Gas and Electric share of
the decommissioning obligation to the extent such obligation may exceed the
funds available within Madison Gas and Electric nonqualified trust fund at the
time of decommissioning. This agreement, the closing of which remains contingent
upon Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval and steam generator replacement
scheduled for the fall of 2001, will result in WisconsinPublic Service
ownership interest in the Kewaunee plant increasing to 59%.
The net book value of WisconsinPublicService
share of the Kewaunee plant at December31,2000 is
$525million. In addition, the current cost of
WisconsinPublicService share of the estimated costs to
decommission the Kewaunee plant, assuming early retirement, exceeds the trust
assets at December31, 2000 by $42million. On
January3,1997, the PublicService Commission of Wisconsin
accepted WisconsinPublicService recommendation to accelerate
recovery of the Wisconsin retail portion of both the current undepreciated plant
balance and the unfunded decommissioning costs over a six-year period, 1997
through 2002. This method of recovery ended on December31,2000, as a
result of a recent Public Service Commission of Wisconsin rate order in Docket
6690-UR-112 authorizing new rates for 2001. This rate order includes a change in
methodology for recovery of the Kewaunee plant investment. Under the new rates,
the investment in the new steam generators will be recovered using the
sum-of-the-years-digits depreciation method with an 85 year remaining life
after installation. The unrecovered plant investment at the end of 2000 will be
recovered over a period ending 85years after the installation of the
steam generators using a straight-line remaining life depreciation methodology.
Also under the 2001 rate order, the funding period for decommissioning was
extended to the end of 2010.
Transmission Assets
During 2000, Wisconsin Public Service committed
to transfer all its transmission assets to American Transmission Company LLC.
This transfer occurred on January1,2001 at the net book value of the
assets. WPSInvestments, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Public
Service, will hold the resulting investment in American Transmission Company and
use the equity method of accounting.
Clean Air Regulations
Early compliance with the federal Clean Air Act has
generated surplus sulfur dioxide allowances. We will consider the sale of any
allowances available in excess of our own needs. The Wisconsin Commission has
ordered that profits from the sale of allowances be passed on to customers.
On December 24, 1998, Wisconsin Public Service joined
other parties in a petition challenging the Environmental Protection Agency
regulations that required Wisconsin to prepare and submit a nitrogen oxide
implementation plan. On January 22, 1999, the State of Wisconsin intervened in
the litigation and challenged the geographic scope of the rule and the required
timing for implementation of nitrogen oxide controls within the state. The
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard arguments on
November 9, 1999. On March3, 2000, the Court held that the Environmental
Protection Agency nitrogen oxide state implementation plan was not
appropriately issued to the State of Wisconsin and vacated the rule for the
State of Wisconsin.
However, under another part of the Clean Air Act, the
State of Wisconsin developed a nitrogen oxide reduction plan for Wisconsin
ozone non-attainment area in southern Wisconsin. The nitrogen oxide reductions
begin in 2003 and are gradually increased through 2007. This plan affects
Edgewater Unit 4. A compliance plan for this unit was started in 2000 and may
include a combination of combustion optimization and emission trading at a cost
of about $5 million. The state rule also seeks voluntary reductions from utility
units outside the ozone non-attainment area, which may lead to additional
expenditures for nitrogen oxide reductions at other units. Wisconsin Public
Service is participating in voluntary efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide levels at
the Columbia Energy Center. Wisconsin Public Service owns 318% of Columbia. The
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved recovery of the costs
associated with nitrogen oxide compliance.
Recent air quality modeling by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources revealed that Weston Units 1 and 2 contribute to a modeled
deviation from the sulfur dioxide ambient air quality standard. Wisconsin Public
Service and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources developed a plan to
eliminate the model deviation by extending the existing stacks at Weston
Units1 and 2 by 55 feet and limiting the sulfur content of the fuel to
12lb/mm Btu. The cost of the stack extension is about $086 million. The
current and projected fuel meets the sulfur content limit. The Environmental
Protection Agency is reviewing this plan.
On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency
announced that it was pursuing an enforcement initiative against seven
utilities, or their subsidiaries, located in the Midwest and the South as well
as the Tennessee Valley Authority. The enforcement initiative alleges that the
utilities may have undertaken projects at certain coal-fired generation plants
in violation of the Clean Air Act. The Environmental Protection Agency is
seeking penalties and the installation of additional pollution control
equipment.
As a continuation of this initiative, the Environmental
Protection Agency requested on December 14, 2000 that Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation provide information pursuant to Section 114 of the Clean Air Act
relating to projects undertaken at the Pulliam and Weston plants. The
information was submitted on January 16, 2001. Wisconsin Power and Light
Company, the operator of units jointly-owned with Wisconsin Public Service, also
submitted information related to projects undertaken at the Columbia and
Edgewater plants.
The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has
initiated a rulemaking effort aimed at the control of mercury emissions. Coal
burning power plants are likely to be the target of this regulatory effort. A
draft of the rule has not been released, and as such, the effect on Wisconsin
Public Service is unknown. However, if restrictive limits are adopted, the costs
could be significant.
WPS Power Development acquired 30 years of emission
allowances as a result of the acquisition of Sunbury Generation, LLC in
November1999. The purchase of WPS Westwood Generation, LLC in
September2000 also resulted in acquiring 30 years of emission allowances.
A consistent valuation across vintage years is being utilized to allocate the
cost of these allowances. The cost assigned to these allowances is being charged
to expense as the allowances are used. The Sunbury plant also purchases
incremental emission allowances on the open market to comply with air
regulations. Additional technology may be required by 2003 in order to comply
with nitrogen oxide standards. Expenditures for this technology could be
significant.
Manufactured Gas Plant Remediation
WisconsinPublicService continues to
investigate the environmental cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites. The
cleanup of Wisconsin Public Service StevensPoint manufactured gas plant
site is complete with monitoring of the site continuing. Costs of this cleanup
were within the range expected for this site. Cleanup began at both of the
Sheboygan sites in November 2000 and is expected to be completed by June 2001.
To-date costs are at expected levels. Wisconsin Public Service estimates future
undiscounted investigation and cleanup costs to be $357million to
$422million. These estimates may be adjusted in the future contingent
upon remediation technology, regulatory requirements, and the assessment of
natural resources damages.
Wisconsin Public Service currently has a $374 million
liability recorded for cleanup with an offsetting regulatory asset deferred
charge. We expect to recover cleanup costs net of insurance recoveries in
current and future customer rates. Carrying costs associated with the cleanup
expenditures will not be recoverable. WisconsinPublic Service has received
$126million in insurance recoveries that we recorded as a reduction to
the regulatory asset.
Future Utility Expenditures
We estimate utility plant construction expenditures at
WisconsinPublic Service for 2001 to be approximately $1797million
and construction expenditures at UpperPeninsula Power for 2001 to be
approximately $287million. WisconsinPublic Service estimates
demand-side management expenditures to be $199 million in 2001. In addition,
recovery of previously deferred demand-side management expenditures of $119
million from customers will occur through 2002. NOTE 14--ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS
On December31,2000, Wisconsin Public Service
increased its ownership in Wisconsin River Power Company to two-thirds by
purchasing an additional one-third interest from Consolidated Water Power
Company. The purchase price was at net book value of Wisconsin River Power at
August 31,2000. In addition, one-third of the net proceeds from the sale
of Wisconsin River Power real estate and wood products over a 12-year period
will be payable to Consolidated Water Power. In 2001, Wisconsin Power and Light
has the option to purchase one-half of our newly purchased one-third share of
Wisconsin River Power. Exercise of this option would result in Wisconsin Public
Service and Wisconsin Power and Light each owning one-half of Wisconsin River
Power, but Wisconsin Public Service would remain the operator of the facility.
Along with Wisconsin Public Service, we entered into a
merger agreement with Wisconsin Fuel and Light on July13,2000. Under
the agreement, Wisconsin Fuel and Light shareholders will receive 173 shares of
WPSResources' common stock for each share of Wisconsin Fuel and Light
common stock. The exchange ratio will be adjusted if, at the time of closing the
transaction, the market price of WPS Resources' common stock exceeds $3396 per
share or is less than $2779 per share. The market price is defined as the
average of the closing price of WPS Resources' common stock during the ten
trading days ending three days immediately preceding the effective date of the
merger.
A majority of the outstanding preferred shareholders of
Wisconsin Public Service approved themerger, allowing Wisconsin Fuel and
Light to merge into WisconsinPublic Service. In November 2000, a majority
of the outstanding common shareholders of Wisconsin Fuel and Light approved the
plan of merger. We will account for the merger using the purchase method of
accounting, and we expect to complete it in April of 2001.
WPS Power Development reached an agreement with Sierra
Pacific Power Company in October2000 to purchase their 545-megawatt Tracy/Pinon
Power Station. The facility consists of natural gas and oil-fired generation
unitsand a coal gasification project that had been co-funded by the
UnitedStates DepartmentofEnergy. Regulatory approval is still
needed to complete the purchase. The purchase price of $2498 million is subject
to taxes and other adjustments at closing. We expect to close the purchase in
2001 and to finance a portion of the purchase with nonrecourse debt. Included
with the purchase is a temporary purchase power agreement to sell the power
generated by Tracy/Pinon to Sierra Pacific.
Also in 2000, WPS Power Development subsidiary, Sunbury
Holdings, LLC, purchased CinCap VI, LLC from Cinergy Capital and Trading, Inc.
CinCap VI owns the 30-megawatt Westwood generation facility located in
Pennsylvania. As of January 1, 2001, CinCap VI changed its name to WPS Westwood
Generation, LLC.
At WPS Energy Services, the price paid in excess of fair
value for the purchase of retail gas contracts acquired in 1999 is being
amortized over a five-year period. NOTE 15--INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS

allowances extend 29 years into the future and are expensed as used by each
facility. NOTE 16--REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
WisconsinPublicService received a rate order
in the Wisconsin jurisdiction effective January 1,2001. The impact is an
estimated $272million increase in electric revenues and an estimated
$43million increase in gas revenues on an annual basis. The new rates are
effective for 2001 and 2002. The PublicService Commission of Wisconsin
authorized a 121% return on WisconsinPublic Service equity for 2001 and
2002. A 2002 rate reopener was not approved by the Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin, but the Commission did acknowledge that pursuant to statutes
Wisconsin Public Service may request a reopener at any time.
On October13,2000, Upper Peninsula Power filed
a $57 million rate increase with the Michigan Public Service Commission. A
final rate order is expected in 2001. Note 17--REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Our utility subsidiaries are recovering their regulatory
assets and returning their regulatory liabilities through rates charged to
customers based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each item.
Except for amounts expended for environmental costs, WisconsinPublic
Service is recovering carrying costs for all regulatory assets.
UpperPeninsula Power may recover carrying costs on environmental
regulatory assets. Based on prior and current rate treatment for such costs, we
believe it is probable that WisconsinPublicService and
UpperPeninsula Power will continue to recover from customers the
regulatory assets described above.
See Notes 11 and 12 for specific information on pension
and income tax related regulatory liabilities. See Note 13 for information on
environmental remediation deferred costs. NOTE 18--SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS
We manage our reportable segments separately due to their
different operating and regulatory environments. Our principal business segments
are the regulated electric utility operations of WisconsinPublic Service
and UpperPeninsula Power and the regulated gas utility operations of
WisconsinPublicService. Our other reportable segments include
WPSEnergy Services and WPSPower Development. WPSEnergy
Services is a diversified energy supply and services company, and WPSPower
Development is an electric generation asset development company. Nonutility
operations and subsidiaries of WPS Resources not already mentioned are included
in the Other column. The tables below present information for the respective

Because of various factors, which affect

WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION F. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of WPS Resources Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of WPSResources Corporation a Wisconsin
corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and retained
earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
WPSResources Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

L. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The following are supplemental notes to the WPS Resources
Corporation financial statements and should be read in conjunction with WPS
Resources consolidated financial statements and the related notes.
NOTE 1--SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LINES OF CREDIT

security for commercial paper outstanding, Wisconsin Public Service maintains
bank lines of credit. These lines of credit require a fee.

NOTE 2--LONG-TERM DEBT
At
WisconsinPublicService, utility plant assets secure first mortgage
bonds. In December1998, WisconsinPublicService issued $500
million of 608% senior notes due in 2028 secured by a pledge of first mortgage
bonds. The 1998 notes become unsecured if WisconsinPublicService
retires all of its outstanding first mortgage bonds.
WisconsinPublicService has no sinking fund
payment requirements on its outstanding debt. A schedule of all debt payments
including bond maturities is as follows

NOTE 3--COMMON EQUITY
WisconsinPublicService is restricted by a
PublicService Commission of Wisconsin order to paying normal common stock
dividends of no more than 109% of the previous year common stock dividend
without the PublicService Commission of Wisconsin approval. The company
may declare special dividends in order to maintain utility common equity levels
consistent with those allowed by the regulators. Wisconsin law prohibits
WisconsinPublicService from making loans to or guaranteeing
obligations of WPSResources or its other subsidiaries.
During 2000, Wisconsin Public Service received equity
infusions of $75million from WPSResources.
WisconsinPublicService paid special common dividends of
$50million to WPSResources in 2000. The equity infusions and special
dividends allowed WisconsinPublicService average equity
capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain near target levels as established
by the PublicService Commission of Wisconsin in its most recent rate
order. NOTE 4--FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following
methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of
financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate such value:
Cash, Short-Term Investments, Energy Conservation Loans,
Notes Payable, and Outstanding Commercial Paper: The carrying amount
approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those investments and
obligations.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts: The value of nuclear
decommissioning trust investments is recorded at market value.
Long-Term Debt, Preferred Stock, and Employee Stock
Ownership Plan Loan Guarantees: The fair value of long-term debt, preferred
stock, and Employee Stock Ownership Plan loan guarantees is estimated based on
the quoted market price for the same or similar issues or on the current rates
offered to WisconsinPublicService for debt of the same remaining
maturity.
The estimated fair values of Wisconsin Public Service
financial instruments as of December31 were

WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE
CORPORATION
M. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and consolidated statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation a Wisconsin corporation and subsidiaries as of December31,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
