42 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Rent-A-Center, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Rent-A-Center, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2004.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Rent-A-Center, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Rent-A-Center, Inc. and Subsidiaries
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSOand our report dated March10, 2005 expressed
an unqualified opinion. Grant Thornton LLP Dallas, Texas March10, 2005 43 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Stockholders Rent-A-Center, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that Rent-A-Center, Inc. and
Subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in COSO. Also, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on criteria established in COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
December31, 2004 and 2003 consolidated balance sheets and
the related consolidated statements of earnings,
stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31, 2004 of the Company
and our report dated March10, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion. Grant Thornton LLP Dallas, Texas March10, 2005 44 Table of Contents MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of the Company, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys internal control
system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to
management and our board of directors regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. A system of internal control may become
inadequate over time because of changes in conditions, or
deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 using the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSOin Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on
this assessment, management has concluded that, as of
December31, 2004, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles based
on such criteria. Grant Thornton LLP, our independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an audit report on our assessment of internal
control over financial reporting. This report appears on

During 2002, the Company paid preferred dividends of
approximately $82million by issuing 8,151shares of
preferred stock. During 2004 and 2003, the Company paid all
preferred dividends in cash, totaling approximately $7700 and
$12800, respectively. See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 49 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NoteA Summary of Accounting Policies and
Nature of Operations A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the
preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial
statements follows   
Principles of Consolidation and Nature of
Operations These financial statements include the accounts of
Rent-A-Center, Inc. Rent-A-Center and its direct
and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries collectively, the
Company. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. At December31, 2004,
the Company operated 2,875company-owned stores nationwide
and in Puerto Rico and Canada, including 21 stores in Wisconsin
operated by a subsidiary, Get It Now, LLC, under the name
Get It Now, and five stores in Canada operated by a
subsidiary, Rent-A-Centre Canada, Ltd., under the name
Rent-A-Centre. The Companys primary operating
segment consists of leasing household durable goods to customers
on a rent-to-own basis. Get It Now offers merchandise on an
installment sales basis in Wisconsin. ColorTyme, Inc. ColorTyme, an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Rent-A-Center, is a nationwide
franchisor of 313 franchised rent-to-own stores operating in
40states at December31, 2004. These rent-to-own
stores offer high quality durable products such as home
electronics, appliances, computers, and furniture and
accessories. ColorTymes primary source of revenues is the
sale of rental merchandise to its franchisees, who, in turn,
offer the merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase
under a rent-to-own program. The balance of ColorTymes
revenue is generated primarily from royalties based on
franchisees monthly gross revenues. Effective as of December31, 2002, the Company completed a
tax-free internal reorganization of its corporate structure. The
reorganization was effected through an inversion merger whereby
Rent-A-Center, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Rent-A-Center Holdings, Inc., a newly formed Delaware holding
company. Upon the merger, Rent-A-Center, Inc. changed its name
to Rent-A-Center East, Inc. Rent-A-Center East and
Rent-A-Center Holdings, Inc. changed its name to Rent-A-Center,
Inc.   
Stock Split On July28, 2003, the Company announced that its Board of
Directors had approved a 5 for 2 stock split on its common stock
to be paid in the form of a stock dividend. Each common
stockholder of record on August15, 2003 received 15
additional shares of common stock for each share of common stock
held on that date. No fractional shares were issued in
connection with the stock dividend. Each stockholder who would
otherwise have received a fractional share received an
additional share of common stock. The distribution date for the
stock dividend was August29, 2003. The effect of the stock
split has been recognized retroactively in all share data in the
consolidated financial statements unless otherwise noted.   
Rental Merchandise Rental merchandise is carried at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation for all merchandise is provided using
the income forecasting method, which is intended to match as
closely as practicable the recognition of depreciation expense
with the consumption of the rental merchandise, and assumes no
salvage value. The consumption of rental merchandise occurs
during periods of rental and directly coincides with the receipt
of rental revenue over the rental-purchase agreement period,
generally 7 to 36months. Under the income forecasting
method, merchandise held for rent is not depreciated and
merchandise on rent is depreciated in the proportion of rents
received to total rents provided in the rental contract, which
is an activity based method similar to the units of production
method. Depreciation is accelerated on computers that are
24months old or older and which have become idle using the
straight-line method for a period of at least six 50 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued months, generally not to exceed an aggregate depreciation period
of 30months. The purpose is to better reflect the
depreciable life of a computer in our stores and to encourage
the sale of older computers. Rental merchandise which is damaged and inoperable, or not
returned by the customer after becoming delinquent on payments,
is expensed when such impairment occurs. Any repairs made to
rental merchandise are expensed at the time of the repair.   
Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents include
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less.   
Revenue Merchandise is rented to customers pursuant to rental-purchase
agreements which provide for weekly or monthly rental terms with
non-refundable rental payments. Generally, the customer has the
right to acquire title either through a purchase option or
through payment of all required rentals. Rental revenue and fees
are recognized over the rental term. Revenue for the total
amount of the rental purchase agreement is not accrued because
the customer can cancel the rental contract at any time and the
Company cannot enforce collection for non-payment of rents.
ColorTymes revenue from the sale of rental merchandise is
recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the franchisee.
Franchise fee revenue is recognized upon completion of
substantially all services and satisfaction of all material
conditions required under the terms of the franchise agreement.
Because Get It Now makes retail sales on an installment credit
basis, Get It Nows revenue is recognized at the time of
such retail sale, as is the cost of the merchandise sold, net of
a provision for uncollectible accounts.   
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Get It Now sells merchandise through installment sales
transactions. The installment note generally consists of the
sales price of the merchandise purchased and any additional fees
for services the customer has chosen, less the customers
down payment. No interest is accrued and interest income is
recognized each time a customer makes a payment, generally on a
monthly basis. The Company has established an allowance for
doubtful accounts for Get It Nows installment notes and
ColorTymes trade receivables. The Companys policy
for determining the allowance is based on historical loss
experience generally, as well as the results of
managements review and analysis of the payment and
collection of the installment notes and trade receivables within
the previous quarter. The Companys policy is to charge off
installment notes and trade receivables which are 90days
or more past due. Charge-offs are applied as a reduction to the
allowance for doubtful accounts and any recoveries of previously
charged off balances are applied as an increase to the allowance
for doubtful accounts.   
Property Assets and Related Depreciation Furniture, equipment and vehicles are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets generally five
years by the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the term of the applicable leases by the
straight-line method. The Company incurs repair and maintenance
expenses on its vehicles and equipment. These amounts are
recognized when incurred, unless such repairs significantly
extend the life of the asset, in which case the Company
amortizes the cost of the repairs for the remaining life of the
asset utilizing the straight-line method. 51 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   
Intangible Assets and Amortization Goodwill is the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets
of acquired businesses. Effective January1, 2002, goodwill
is no longer amortized, but evaluated at least annually for
impairment, in accordance with SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Intangible assets
that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over
their useful lives. Under SFASNo142, the Company is required to test
all existing goodwill for impairment. A discounted cash flow
approach is used to test goodwill for impairment. There were no
impairment charges in 2004, 2003 or 2002 for goodwill.   
Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates all long-lived assets, including
intangible assets, excluding goodwill and rental merchandise,
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
Impairment is recognized when the carrying amounts of such
assets cannot be recovered by the undiscounted net cash flows
they will generate.   
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company is not currently a party to any interest rate swap
agreements. Under the Companys previous credit facility,
the Company entered into interest-rate swap agreements in order
to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by
decreasing the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated
with changes in the applicable rates. The interest-rate swaps
were derivative instruments related to forecasted transactions
and hedged future cash flows. The effective portion of any gains
or losses were included in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss until earnings were affected by the variability of
cash flows. Any ineffective portion was recognized into
earnings. The cash flows of the interest-rate swaps offset cash
flows attributable to fluctuations in the cash flows of the
previous floating-rate senior credit facility. If it became
probable a forecasted transaction would no longer occur, the
interest-rate swaps were carried on the balance sheet at fair
value, and gains or losses that were deferred in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss were recognized immediately
into earnings. Changes in the fair value of the effective cash flow hedges were
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. The
effective portion that had been deferred in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss was reclassified to earnings when
the hedged items impacted earnings. The interest-rate swaps were based on the same index as their
respective underlying debt. The interest-rate swaps were
effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the
fluctuations in the cash flows of the hedged risk, and no amount
was required to be reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income loss into earnings for hedge
ineffectiveness during the two years ended December31,
2003. The interest-rate swap resulted in an increase of interest
expense of $45million and $94million for the years
ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The fair
value of the interest-rate swaps increased by $26million,
net of tax, during the year ended December31, 2002, which
had been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
During the year ended December31, 2002, the amount of cash
flow loss reclassified to earnings because it became probable
that the original forecasted transaction would not occur was not
material. In May 2003, the Company extinguished the remaining
interest rate swap in connection with its recapitalization
program. The accumulated loss in other comprehensive income of
approximately $37million was recognized immediately into
earnings and is included in the finance charge of
$353million on the statement of earnings for 2003. 52 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued   
Income Taxes The Company records deferred taxes for temporary differences
between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and
liabilities at the rate expected to be in effect when taxes
become payable.   
Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per common share are based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each period
presented. Diluted earnings per common share are based upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, plus, if dilutive, the assumed exercise of stock options
and the assumed conversion of convertible securities at the
beginning of the year, or for the period outstanding during the
year for current year issuances.   
Advertising Costs Costs incurred for producing and communicating advertising are
expensed when incurred. Advertising expense was
$627million, $678million, and $627million
in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company has in place a long-term incentive plan for the
benefit of certain employees, consultants and directors, which
is described more fully in NoteM. The Company accounts for
this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related Interpretations. No stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net earnings, as all
options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to
the quoted market price of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net
earnings and earnings per share if the Company had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASBStatement No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based
employee compensation.

For all periods prior to April1, 2004, the fair value of
these options was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions: expected volatility of 550%, risk-free
interest rates of 29% and 37% and expected lives of four years
in 2004 and seven years in 2003 and 2002, respectively, and no
dividend yield. For options granted on or after April1,
2004, the 53 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued fair value of the options was estimated at the date of grant
using the binomial method pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions: expected volatility of 535%, a
risk-free interest rate of 28%, no dividend yield and an
expected life of four years. Had the Company changed from using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model to a binomial method
pricing model effective January1, 2004 rather than
April1, 2004, the impact would not have been significant.   
Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. In applying accounting
principles, the Company must often make individual estimates and
assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties. The
Companys estimates, judgments and assumptions are
continually evaluated based on available information and
experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the
financial reporting process, actual results could differ from
those estimates. The Company believes that self-insurance
liabilities and litigation reserves are areas where the degree
of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in
its consolidated financial statements make the accounting
policies critical. Please see the Critical Accounting Policies
Involving Critical Estimates, Uncertainties or Assessment in Our
Financial Statements section on page26 of this report.   
Other Income From time to time, the Company intends to sell to certain
qualified buyers its right to collect outstanding amounts due,
as well as its interest in the merchandise rented, pursuant to
delinquent rental purchase agreements that have been charged off
in the ordinary course of business. Over time, the Company
expects to sell charged off accounts on a regular basis.
However, there can be no assurance that such sales will occur,
or if consummated, will result in material sales proceeds. In December 2004, the Company sold, without recourse, certain of
its charged off accounts, ranging from approximately one to five
years old, for approximately $79million and recorded it
as other income on the Companys consolidated statement of
earnings.   
New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB enacted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards123 revised 2004
SFAS123R, Share-Based Payment, which
replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion
No25 APB25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees. SFAS123R requires the measurement
of all employee share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based
method and the recording of such expense in the Companys
consolidated statement of earnings. The accounting provisions of
SFAS123R are effective for reporting periods beginning
after June15, 2005. The Company is required to adopt SFAS123R in the third
quarter of 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted
under SFAS123 no longer will be an alternative to
financial statement recognition. See the Stock-Based
Compensation section shown earlier in this note for the pro
forma net earnings and earnings per share amounts for 2002
through 2004 as if the Company had used a fair-value-based
method similar to the methods required under SFAS123R to
measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive
awards. Although the Company has not yet determined whether the
adoption of SFAS123R will result in amounts that are
different from the current pro forma disclosures under
SFAS123, the Company is evaluating the requirements under
SFAS123R and expect the adoption to have a significant
impact on the Companys 54 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued consolidated statement of earnings and earnings per share, but
no impact on its financial condition or cash flows.

The total purchase price includes non-cash consideration of
approximately $238million in common stock issued and
approximately $61million in fair value assigned to the
stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition of Rent
Rite,Inc. Rent-Way, Inc. On February8, 2003, the Company
completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of
295rent-to-own stores from Rent-Way, Inc. for an aggregate
purchase price of $1004million in cash. Of the aggregate
purchase price, the Company held back $100million to pay
for various indemnified liabilities and expenses, if any, of
which $50million was remitted in the second quarter of
2003 and the remaining amount of $50million was remitted
in August 2004. The Company funded the acquisition entirely from
cash on hand. Of the 295 stores, 176 were subsequently merged
with the Companys existing store locations. The Company
entered into this transaction seeing it as an opportunistic
acquisition that would allow it to expand its store and customer
base in conjunction with its strategic growth plans. The
acquisition price was determined by evaluating the average
monthly rental income of the acquired stores and applying a
multiple to the total. The asset values are based upon the fair
value assigned to the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired which are based upon the present value of future
cash flows, historic longevity of like-kind customer base,
historic profitability of like-kind customer base and the number
of customer relationships acquired. The excess of purchase
consideration over the fair value of tangible assets and
identifiable intangible assets acquired was assigned to
goodwill. The final purchase price allocation resulted in a
$40million decrease in the value assigned to customer
relationships and a $40million increase in the value
placed on the non-compete agreement as compared to the
Companys original estimates as disclosed in its 2002
Annual Report on Form10-K. The table below summarizes the

The Company entered into these transactions seeing them as
opportunistic acquisitions that would allow the Company to
expand its store base in conjunction with its strategic growth
plans. The prices of the acquisitions were determined by
evaluating the average monthly rental income of the acquired
stores and applying a multiple to the total. Customer
relationships acquired in these transactions are being amortized
utilizing the straight-line method over an 18month period.
The non-compete agreements in these transactions are being
amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the
agreements and, in accordance with SFAS142, the goodwill
associated with the acquisitions will not be amortized. All acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases, and the
operating results of the acquired stores and accounts have been
included in the financial statements since their date of
acquisition. NoteF Recapitalization Recapitalization. In April 2003, the Company announced
and commenced a program to recapitalize a portion of its
financial structure in a series of transactions. The
recapitalization consisted of the tender offer for all of
Rent-A-Center Easts $27225million principal amount
of senior subordinated notes, paying 11 59 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued interest, due 2008 the 11%Notes, the
redemption of the 11%Notes, the issuance of
$3000million principal amount of senior subordinated
notes, paying
71/2%interest,
due 2010 the
71/2%Notes,
the refinancing of its senior debt and the repurchase of shares
of its common stock. On May6, 2003, the Company repurchased approximately
$1830million principal amount of 11%Notes pursuant
to a debt tender offer announced on April23, 2003. On
August15, 2003, the Company redeemed all of the remaining
outstanding 11%Notes in accordance with the terms of the
indenture governing the 11%Notes, at the applicable
redemption price of 1055% of the principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to that date. The total aggregate redemption
price for the 11%Notes was approximately
$9375million, including $465million in accrued
interest and $465million in redemption premium. Proceeds
from the offering of $300million in
71/2%Notes
were used to pay for the redemption. On April25, 2003, the Company announced that it entered
into an agreement with Apollo which provided for the repurchase
of a number of shares of Rent-A-Centers common stock
sufficient to reduce Apollos aggregate record ownership to
1900% after consummation of Rent-A-Centers planned tender
offer at the price per share paid in the tender offer. On
April28, 2003, the Company commenced a tender offer to
purchase up to 22million shares of Rent-A-Centers
common stock on a pre-split basis pursuant to a modified
Dutch Auction. On June25, 2003, the Company
closed the tender offer and purchased 1,769,960shares of
Rent-A-Centers common stock on a pre-split basis at
$73per share on a pre-split basis for approximately
$1292million. On July11, 2003, the Company closed
the Apollo transaction and purchased 774,547shares of
Rent-A-Centers common stock on a pre-split basis at
$73per share on a pre-split basis for approximately
$565million. As contemplated by the Apollo agreement,
Apollo also exchanged their shares of SeriesA preferred
stock for shares of SeriesC preferred stock. As a result,
no shares of SeriesA preferred stock remain outstanding.
The terms of the SeriesA preferred stock and SeriesC
preferred stock are substantially similar, except the
SeriesC preferred stock does not have the right to
directly elect any members of Rent-A-Centers Board of
Directors. On May6, 2003, Rent-A-Center issued $3000million in
71/2%Notes,
the proceeds of which were used, in part, to fund the repurchase
and redemption of the 11%Notes. On May28, 2003, the Company refinanced its then existing
senior debt by entering into a new $6000million senior
credit facility, consisting of a $4000million term loan,
a $1200million revolving credit facility and an
$800million additional term loan. During the second and third quarter of 2003, the Company
recorded an aggregate of $353million in non-recurring
financing charges in connection with the foregoing
recapitalization which consisted of senior subordinated note
premiums of approximately $187million, senior
subordinated note issue costs and loan origination fees of
approximately $119million and other bank charges and fees
of approximately $47million. NoteG Senior Credit Facilities On July14, 2004, the Company announced the completion of
the refinancing of its senior secured debt. The Companys
new $6000million senior credit facilities consist of a
$3500million term loan and a $2500million
revolving credit facility. On that day, the Company drew down
the $3500million term loan and $500million of the
revolving facility and utilized the proceeds to repay its old
senior term debt from the 2003 recapitalization. In connection
with the refinancing, the Company recorded a $42million
non-cash charge to write off the remaining unamortized balance
of financing costs in the third quarter of 2004. On May28, 2003, the Company entered into a senior credit
facility provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial
institutions led by Lehman Commercial Paper, Inc., as
administrative agent. At December31, 2003, the Company had
a total of $3980million outstanding under this senior
credit facility related to its term loans and $902million
of availability under the revolving credit line portion of this
senior credit facility. The senior credit facility also included
an $800million additional term loan facility. The
facility was held to 60 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued support the Companys outstanding letters of credit. In the
event that a letter of credit was drawn upon, the Company had
the right to either repay the additional term loan facility
lenders the amount withdrawn or request a loan in that amount.
Interest on any requested additional term loan facility loan
accrued at an adjusted prime rate plus 125% or, at the
Companys option, at the Eurodollar base rate plus 225 with the entire amount of the additional term loan facility due
in May 2009. The senior credit facilities as of December31, 2004 and

At December31, 2004 and 2003, the amounts available under
the Companys revolving facility were reduced by
approximately $1056million and $298million,
respectively, for outstanding letters of credit used to support
the Companys insurance obligations. The Company provides
assurance to its insurance providers that if they are not able
to draw funds from the Company for claims paid, they have the
ability to draw against the Companys letters of credit. At
that time, the Company would then owe the drawn amount to the
financial institution providing the letter of credit. One of the
Companys letters of credit is renewed automatically every
year unless the Company notifies the institution not to renew.
The other letter of credit expires in August 2005, but is
automatically renewed each year for a one year period unless the
institution notifies the Company no later than thirty days prior
to the applicable expiration date that such institution does not
elect to renew the letter of credit for such additional one year
period. Borrowings under the Companys senior credit facilities
bear interest at varying rates equal to the Eurodollar rate plus
175%. The Eurodollar rate was 242% at December31, 2004.
The Company also has a prime rate option under the facility, but
has not exercised it to date. The Company has not entered into
any interest rate protection agreements with respect to term
loans under the new senior credit facility. A commitment fee
equal to 025% to 050% of the unused portion of the revolving
credit facility is payable quarterly. The Companys senior credit facilities contain, without
limitation, covenants that generally limit its ability to   
incur additional debt including subordinated debt in excess of
$50million at any one time outstanding

with several financial covenants, including a maximum
consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated interest
coverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The

Events of default under the Companys senior credit
facility include customary events, such as a cross-acceleration
provision in the event that it defaults on other debt. In
addition, an event of default under the senior credit facility
would occur if there is a change of control. This is defined to
include the case where a third party becomes the beneficial
owner of 35% or more of Rent-A-Centers voting stock or
certain changes in Rent-A-Centers Board of Directors
occur. An event of default would also occur if one or more
judgments were entered against the Company of $200million
or more and such judgments were not satisfied or bonded pending
appeal within 30days after entry. The following are scheduled maturities of the senior term debt

NoteH Subordinated NotesPayable 11%Senior Subordinated Notes. In December 2001,
Rent-A-Center East issued $1000million of 11%senior
subordinated notes, maturing on August15, 2008, under an
indenture dated as of December19, 2001 among Rent-A-Center
East, its subsidiary guarantors and The Bank of New York, as
trustee. On May2, 2002, Rent-A-Center East closed an
exchange offer for, among other things, approximately
$1750million of senior subordinated notes issued by it
under a previous indenture, such that, on that date, all senior
subordinated notes were governed by the terms of the 2001
indenture. The 2001 indenture contained covenants that limited
Rent-A-Center Easts ability to, among other things, incur
additional debt, grants liens to third parties, and pay
dividends or repurchase stock. On May6, 2003,
Rent-A-Center East repurchased approximately $1830million
of its then outstanding 11%Notes. On August15, 2003,
Rent-A-Center East redeemed the remaining outstanding
11%Notes. 71/2%Senior
Subordinated Notes. On May6, 2003, Rent-A-Center
issued $3000million in senior subordinated notes due
2010, bearing interest at
71/2 pursuant to an indenture dated May6, 2003, among
Rent-A-Center, Inc., its subsidiary guarantors the
Subsidiary Guarantors and The Bank of New York, as
trustee. The proceeds of this offering were used to fund the
repurchase and redemption of the then outstanding 11%Notes. 62 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued The 2003 indenture contains covenants that limit
Rent-A-Centers ability to   
incur additional debt     
sell assets or its subsidiaries     
grant liens to third parties     
pay dividends or repurchase stock;and     
engage in a merger or sell substantially all of its assets. Events of default under the 2003 indenture include customary
events, such as a cross-acceleration provision in the event that
the Company defaults in the payment of other debt due at
maturity or upon acceleration for default in an amount exceeding
$500million, as well as in the event a judgment is
entered against the Company in excess of $500million that
is not discharged, bonded or insured. The
71/2%Notes
may be redeemed on or after May1, 2006, at the
Companys option, in whole or in part, at a premium
declining from 10375%. The
71/2%Notes
also require that upon the occurrence of a change of control as
defined in the 2003 indenture, the holders of the notes have
the right to require Rent-A-Center to repurchase the notes at a
price equal to 101% of the original aggregate principal amount,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of repurchase. This would trigger an event of default under the
Companys senior credit facilities. Rent-A-Center and the Subsidiary Guarantors have fully, jointly
and severally, and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of
Rent-A-Center with respect to the
71/2%Notes.
Rent-A-Center has no independent assets or operations, and each
Subsidiary Guarantor is 100% owned directly or indirectly by
Rent-A-Center. The only direct or indirect subsidiaries of
Rent-A-Center that are not guarantors are minor subsidiaries.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the
Subsidiary Guarantors to transfer funds to Rent-A-Center in the
form of loans, advances or dividends, except as provided by
applicable law. Set forth below is certain condensed consolidating financial
information as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and for each

NoteJ Redeemable Convertible Voting
Preferred Stock There are only two shares of SeriesC preferred stock
issued and outstanding at December31, 2004 and 2003. In August 1998, Rent-A-Center issued $2600million of
redeemable convertible voting preferred stock with a
$01par value. In connection with such issuance,
Rent-A-Center entered into a registration rights agreement with
affiliates of Apollo which, among other things, granted them two
rights to request that their shares be registered, and a
registration rights agreement with an affiliate of Bear Stearns,
which granted them the right to participate in any
company-initiated registration of shares, subject to certain
exceptions. In May 2002, Apollo exercised one of their two
rights to request that their shares be registered and an
affiliate of Bear 66 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued Stearns elected to participate in such registration. In
connection therewith, Apollo and the affiliate of Bear Stearns
converted 97,197shares of Rent-A-Centers preferred
stock held by them into 3,500,000shares on a pre-split
basis of Rent-A-Centers common stock, which they sold in
the May 2002 public offering that was the subject of
Apollos request. Rent-A-Center did not receive any of the
proceeds from this offering. On August5, 2002, the first date in which Rent-A-Center
had the right to optionally redeem the shares of preferred
stock, the holders of Rent-A-Centers preferred stock
converted all but two shares of Rent-A-Centers preferred
stock held by them into 7,281,548shares of
Rent-A-Centers common stock on a pre-split basis. As a
result, the dividend on Rent-A-Centers preferred stock has
been substantially eliminated. Rent-A-Centers preferred stock is convertible, at any
time, into shares of Rent-A-Centers common stock at a
conversion price equal to $11174per share, and has a
liquidation preference of $1,000per share, plus all
accrued and unpaid dividends. No distributions may be made to
holders of common stock until the holders of the preferred stock
have received the liquidation preference. Dividends accrue on a
quarterly basis, at the rate of $3750per annum, per
share. During 2002, Rent-A-Center accounted for shares of
preferred stock distributed as dividends in-kind at the greater
of the stated value or the value of the common stock obtainable
upon conversion on the payment date. During 2002, Rent-A-Center
paid approximately $82million in preferred dividends by
issuing 8,151shares of preferred stock. During 2004 and
2003, Rent-A-Center paid all preferred stock dividends in cash. Affiliates of Apollo hold all of Rent-A-Centers
outstanding SeriesC preferred stock. Pursuant to the terms
of a stockholders agreement entered into among Rent-A-Center,
Apollo, MarkE. Speese and certain other parties, Apollo
has the right to designate one person to be nominated to
Rent-A-Centers Board of Directors. The terms of the
SeriesC preferred stock as well as the stockholders
agreement also contain provisions requiring Apollos
approval to effect certain transactions involving the Company,
including repurchasing shares of Rent-A-Centers common
stock, declaring or paying any dividend on its common stock,
increasing the size of Rent-A-Centers Board of Directors
to more than eight persons, selling all or substantially all of
the Companys assets and entering into any merger or
consolidation or other business combination. These documents also provide that one member of each of
Rent-A-Centers board committees must be a director who was
designated for nomination by Apollo. In addition, the terms of
the SeriesC preferred stock and the stockholders agreement
restrict the Companys ability to issue debt or equity
securities with a value in excess of $10million without
the majority affirmative vote of Rent-A-Centers finance
committee, and in most cases, require the unanimous vote of its
finance committee for the issuance of Rent-A-Centers
equity securities with a value in excess of $10million. NoteK Income Taxes The income tax provision reconciled to the tax computed at the

From time to time, Rent-A-Center, along with its subsidiaries,
is party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business. Except as set forth below, Rent-A-Center is
not currently a party to any material litigation. The ultimate
outcome of litigation is uncertain and the amount of any loss
that may be incurred, if any, cannot in the Companys
judgment be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, other than with
respect to the $470million pertaining to the
Griego/Carrillo settlement and anticipated legal fees and
expenses for the other matters listed, no provision has been
made in the consolidated financial statements for any such loss. Colonv. Thorn Americas, Inc. The plaintiff filed
this class action in November 1997 in New York state court. This
matter was assumed by the Company in connection with the Thorn
Americas acquisition, and appropriate purchase accounting
adjustments were made for such contingent liabilities. The
plaintiff acknowledges that rent-to-own transactions in New York
are subject to the provisions of New Yorks Rental Purchase
Statute but contends the Rental Purchase Statute does not
provide Thorn Americas immunity from suit for other statutory
violations. The plaintiff alleges Thorn Americas has a duty to
disclose effective interest under New York consumer protection
laws, and seeks damages and injunctive relief for Thorn
Americas failure to do so. This suit also alleges
violations relating to excessive and unconscionable pricing,
late fees, harassment, undisclosed charges, and the ease of use
and accuracy of its payment records. In the prayer for relief,
the plaintiff requested class certification, injunctive relief
requiring Thorn Americas to cease certain marketing practices
and price their rental purchase contracts in certain ways,
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, rescission of the
class members contracts, an order placing in trust all moneys
received by Thorn Americas in connection with the rental of
merchandise during the class period, treble damages,
attorneys fees, filing fees and costs of suit, pre- and
post-judgment interest, and any further relief granted by the
court. The plaintiff has not alleged a specific monetary amount
with respect to the request for damages. The proposed class includes all New York residents who were
party to the Companys rent-to-own contracts from
November26, 1994. In November 2000, following
interlocutory appeal by both parties from the denial of
cross-motions for summary judgment, the Company obtained a
favorable ruling from the Appellate Division of the State of New
York, dismissing the plaintiffs claims based on the
alleged failure to disclose an effective interest rate. The
plaintiffs other claims were not dismissed. The plaintiff
moved to certify a state-wide class in December 2000. The
plaintiffs class certification motion was heard by the
court on November7, 2001 and, on September12, 2002,
the court issued an opinion denying in part and granting in part
the plaintiffs requested certification. The opinion grants
certification as to all of the plaintiffs claims except
the plaintiffs pricing claims pursuant to the Rental
Purchase Statute, as to which certification was denied. The
parties have differing views as to the effect of the
courts opinion, and accordingly, the court granted the
parties permission to submit competing orders as to the effect
of the opinion on the plaintiffs specific claims. Both
proposed orders were submitted to the court on March27,
2003, and on May30, 2003, the court held a hearing
regarding such orders. No order has yet been entered by the
court. There has been no 69 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued activity in this case since May 2003, and the case is currently
dormant. In the event the court does enter a final certification
order and regardless of the courts determination of that
final certification order, the Company intends to pursue an
interlocutory appeal of such certification order. The Company believes these claims are without merit and will
continue to vigorously defend itself in this case. However, the
Company cannot assure you that it will be found to have no
liability in this matter. Terry Walker, et.al.v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., et.
al. On January4, 2002, a putative class action was
filed against the Company and certain of the Companys
current and former officers and directors by Terry Walker in
federal court in Texarkana, Texas. The complaint alleged that
the defendants violated Sections10b and/or
Section20a of the Securities Exchange Act and
Rule10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing false and
misleading statements and omitting material facts regarding the
Companys financial performance and prospects for the third
and fourth quarters of 2001. The complaint purported to be
brought on behalf of all purchasers of the Companys common
stock from April25, 2001 through October8, 2001 and
sought damages in unspecified amounts. Similar complaints were
consolidated by the court with the Walker matter in
October 2002. On November25, 2002, the lead plaintiffs in the Walker
matter filed an amended consolidated complaint which added
certain of the Companys outside directors as defendants to
the Exchange Act claims. The amended complaint also added
additional claims that the Company, and certain of its current
and former officers and directors, violated various provisions
of the Securities Act as a result of alleged misrepresentations
and omissions in connection with an offering in May 2001 and
also added the managing underwriters in that offering as
defendants. On February7, 2003, the Company, along with certain
officer and director defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the
matter as well as a motion to transfer venue. In addition, the
Companys outside directors named in the matter separately
filed a motion to dismiss the Securities Act claims on statute
of limitations grounds. On February19, 2003, the
underwriter defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the
matter. The plaintiffs filed response briefs to these motions,
to which the Company replied on May21, 2003. A hearing was
held by the court on June26, 2003 to hear each of these
motions. On September30, 2003, the court granted the Companys
motion to dismiss without prejudice, dismissed without prejudice
the outside directors and underwriters separate
motions to dismiss and denied the Companys motion to
transfer venue. In its order on the motions to dismiss, the
court granted the lead plaintiffs leave to replead the case
within certain parameters. On October9, 2003, the lead
plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with the court
with respect to the Securities Act claims, which the court
subsequently denied. On July7, 2004, the plaintiffs again repled their claims
by filing a third amended consolidated complaint, raising
allegations of similar violations against the same parties
generally based upon alleged facts not previously asserted. The
Company, along with certain officer and director defendants and
the underwriter defendants, filed motions to dismiss the third
amended consolidated complaint on August23, 2004. The
plaintiffs filed response briefs to these motions on
October6, 2004, to which the Company filed a reply brief
on November18, 2004, and the other defendants filed reply
briefs on November17, 2004. No hearing has been set on the
pending motions. The Company continues to believe the plaintiffs claims in
this matter are without merit and intend to vigorously defend
itself. However, the Company cannot assure you that it will be
found to have no liability in this matter. Benjamin Griego, etal.v. Rent-A-Center, Inc.,
etal. This matter is a state-wide class action
originally filed in SanDiego, California on
January21, 2002 by Benjamin Griego. A similar matter,
entitled Arthur Carrillo, etal.v. Rent-A-Center,
Inc., etal, filed on April12, 2002 in Los
Angeles, California, was coordinated 70 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued with Griego in the Superior Court for the County of
SanDiego on September10, 2002. The matter involves
claims under various consumer protections laws in California
challenging certain of the Companys business practices in
that state. The plaintiffs did not allege specific damages, but
contend that no proof of actual harm or damage on the part of
the individual consumer is necessary to establish recovery for
these claims, which the Company vigorously disputes. The court
entered a class certification order on March16, 2004. On October25, 2004, before the court ruled on various
pending matters, the Company announced that it had reached a
prospective settlement with the plaintiffs to resolve these
matters. Under the terms of the settlement, which has now been
documented and preliminarily approved by the court, the Company
anticipates that it will pay an aggregate of $375million
in cash, to be distributed to an agreed-upon class of its
customers from February 1999 through October 2004, as well as
the plaintiffs attorneys fees up to $90million and
costs to administer the settlement in amounts to be determined.
In addition, the Company anticipates issuing vouchers to
qualified class members for two weeks free rent on a new rental
agreement for merchandise of their choice. Under the terms of
the settlement, the Company is entitled to any undistributed
monies up to an aggregate of $80million, with any
additional undistributed funds paid to non-profit organizations
to be determined. In connection with the settlement, the Company
is not admitting liability for its past business practices in
California. To account for the aforementioned costs, as well as
its own attorneys fees, the Company recorded a pre-tax
charge of $470million in the third quarter of 2004. The terms of the settlement are subject to obtaining final
approval from the court. Notice of the settlement was mailed to
class members on February7, 2005, and published in several
newspapers on February 16 and18, 2005. Objections to the
settlement are due on March11, 2005, and the final
approval hearing is scheduled for April8, 2005. The
Company expects to fund the entire settlement amount immediately
following final approval by the court. While the Company
believes that the terms of this settlement are fair, there can
be no assurance that the settlement will receive final approval
from the court in its present form. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company received an
inquiry from the California Attorney General regarding its
business practices in California with respect to the
Companys cash prices and its membership program. The
Company is cooperating with the Attorney Generals office
in this inquiry. Carey Duron, et. al.v. Rent-A-Center, Inc. This
matter is a putative class action filed on August29, 2003
in the District Court of Jefferson County, Texas by Carey Duron,
who alleges the Company violated certain provisions of the Texas
Business and Commerce Code relating to late fees charged by the
Company under the Companys rental purchase agreements in
Texas. In the complaint, Duron alleges that her contract
provided for a percentage late fee greater than that permitted
by Texas law, that she was charged and paid a late fee in excess
of the amount permitted by Texas law and that the Company had a
policy and practice of assessing and collecting late fees in
excess of that allowed by Texas law. Duron has not alleged
specific damages in the complaint, but seeks to recover actual
damages, statutory damages, interest, reasonable attorneys
fees and costs of court. When this matter was filed, the Company promptly investigated
Durons allegations, including the formula it uses to
calculate late fees in Texas. While the Company does not believe
the formula utilized during this time period violated Texas law,
in late 2003, the Company sent written notice to approximately
29,500 of its Texas customers for whom the Company had records
and who were potentially adversely impacted by the
Companys calculation. The Company also refunded
approximately $37,000 in the aggregate to the customers it could
locate. In taking these measures, the Company believes it
complied with the curative measures provided for under the Texas
statute. The Company also reprogrammed its computer system in
Texas to modify the formula by which late fees are calculated. On November26, 2003, the Company filed a motion for
summary judgment in this matter. On December4, 2003, Duron
filed her motion for class certification. On March11,
2004, the Company was 71 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued notified that the court denied its summary judgment motion and
granted Durons motion for class certification. The
certified class includes the Companys customers in Texas
from August29, 1999 through March5, 2004 who were
charged and paid a late fee in excess of the amount permitted by
Texas law. The Company appealed the certification order to the
Court of Appeals, which it was entitled to do as a matter of
right under applicable Texas law. On October28, 2004, the
Court of Appeals reversed the trial courts certification
order and remanded the case back to the trial court. Duron did
not perfect an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, as she was
entitled to do, and there has been no activity in the case since
the decision by the Court of Appeals. Under the Texas statute, a consumer damaged by a violation is
entitled to recover actual damages, statutory damages equal to
twenty-five percent of an amount equal to the total amount of
payments required to obtain ownership of the merchandise
involved but not less than $250 nor more than $1,000,
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs. With respect to
the approximately 29,500 Texas customers for whom the Company
has records representing approximately two years of the
recently certified class, the Company believes that twenty-five
percent of the total amount of payments to obtain ownership the
maximum percentage applicable to statutory damages under those
rental purchase agreements was approximately $600per
agreement on average. The Company believes the claims in Durons complaint are
unfounded and that it has meritorious defenses to the
allegations made. Although the Company intends to vigorously
defend itself in this case, the Company cannot assure you that
it will be found to have no liability in this matter.   
State Wage and Hour ClassActions The Company is subject to various actions filed against it in
the states of Oregon, California and Washington alleging the
Company violated the wage and hour laws of such states. As of
December31, 2004, the Company operated 26 stores in
Oregon, 163 stores in California and 42 stores in Washington. Rob Pucci, et. al.v. Rent-A-Center, Inc. On
August20, 2001, this putative class action was filed
against the Company in state court in Multnomah County, Oregon
alleging it violated various provisions of Oregon state law
regarding overtime, lunch and work breaks, that the Company
failed to pay all wages due to its Oregon employees, and various
contract claims that the Company promised but failed to pay
overtime. Pucci seeks to represent a class of all present and
former executive assistants, inside/outside managers and account
managers employed by the Company within the six year period
prior to the filing of the complaint as to the contract claims,
and three years as to the statutory claims, and seeks class
certification, payments for all unpaid wages under Oregon law,
statutory and civil penalties, costs and disbursements, pre- and
post-judgment interest in the amount of 9%per annum and
attorneys fees. On July25, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a
motion for class certification and on July31, 2002, the
Company filed its motion for summary judgment. On
January15, 2003, the court orally granted the
Companys motion for summary judgment in part, ruling that
the plaintiffs were prevented from recovering overtime payments
at the rate of time and a half, but stated that the
plaintiffs may recover straight-time to the extent
plaintiffs could prove purported class members worked in excess
of forty hours in a work week but were not paid for such time
worked. The court denied the Companys motion for summary
judgment on the remaining claims. The Company strongly disagrees
with the courts rulings against its positions and
requested that the court grant the Company interlocutory appeal
on those matters. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary
judgment seeking to resolve certain factual issues related to
the purported class, which was denied on July1, 2003. On
October10, 2003, the court issued an opinion letter
stating that it would certify a class and not permit an
interlocutory appeal, and issued its written order to that
effect on December9, 2003. The Company subsequently filed
a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Oregon Supreme Court,
which was denied on January24, 2004. On June15,
2004, notice to the class was distributed advising them of their
right to opt out of the class. The Company has not been advised
that any class member has opted out of the class. The Company
intends to continue to challenge the appropriateness of the
courts class certification. On January31, 2005,
plaintiffs filed a partial motion for summary judgment 72 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued regarding their allegation that the Company failed to timely pay
wages on termination. The Companys response to this matter
is due on April14, 2005, and the court has set a hearing
on May11, 2005 to hear this motion. On February25,
2005, the court denied the Companys previously filed
motion to compel arbitration with respect to class members that
signed agreements to arbitrate claims against the Company. The
Company is evaluating the possibility of appealing the denial of
its motion to compel. Jeremy Burdusis, etal. v. Rent-A-Center, Inc.,
etal./ Israel French, etal.v. Rent-A-Center,
Inc. These matters pending in Los Angeles, California were
filed on October23, 2001, and October30, 2001,
respectively, and allege similar violations of the wage and hour
laws of California as those in Pucci. The same law firm
seeking to represent the purported class in Pucci is
seeking to represent the purported class in Burdusis. The
Burdusis and French proceedings are pending before
the same judge in California. On March24, 2003, the
Burdusis court denied the plaintiffs motion for
class certification in that case, which the Company views as a
favorable development in that proceeding. On April25,
2003, the plaintiffs in Burdusis filed a notice of appeal
of that ruling, and on May8, 2003, the Burdusis
court, at the Companys request, stayed further
proceedings in Burdusis and French pending the
resolution on appeal of the courts denial of class
certification in Burdusis. In June 2004, the Burdusis
plaintiffs filed their appellate brief. The Companys
response brief was filed in September 2004, and the
Burdusis plaintiffs filed their reply in October 2004. On
February9, 2005, the California Court of Appeals reversed
and remanded the trial courts denial of class
certification in Burdusis and directed the trial court to
reconsider its ruling in light of two other recent appellate
court decisions, including the opinions of the California
Supreme Court in Sav-On Drug Stores, Inc.v. Superior
Court, and of the California appeals court in
Bellv. Farmers Insurance Exchange. No hearing has
been scheduled with the trial court with respect to this matter. On October30, 2003, the plaintiffs counsel in
Burdusis and French filed a new non-class lawsuit
in Orange County, California entitled Kris Corso,
etal.v. Rent-A-Center, Inc. The plaintiffs
counsel later amended this complaint to add additional
plaintiffs, totaling approximately 339 individuals. The claims
made are substantially the same as those in Burdusis. On
January16, 2004, the Company filed a demurrer to the
complaint, arguing, among other things, that the plaintiffs in
Corso were misjoined. On February19, 2004, the
court granted the Companys demurrer on the misjoinder
argument, with leave for the plaintiffs to replead. On
March8, 2004, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in
Corso, increasing the number of plaintiffs to
approximately 400. The claims in the amended complaint are
substantially the same as those in Burdusis. The Company
filed a demurrer with respect to the amended complaint on
April12, 2004, which the court granted on May6,
2004. However, the court allowed the plaintiffs to again replead
the action on a representative basis, which they did on
May26, 2004. The Company subsequently filed a demurrer
with respect to the newly repled action, which the court granted
on August12, 2004. The court subsequently stayed the
Corso matter pending the outcome of the Burdusis
matter. Kevin Rose, etal.v. Rent-A-Center, Inc.
etal. This matter pending in Clark County, Washington
was filed on June26, 2001, and alleges similar violations
of the wage and hour laws of Washington as those in
Pucci. The same law firm seeking to represent the
purported class in Pucci is seeking to represent the
purported class in this matter. On May14, 2003, the
Rose court denied the plaintiffs motion for class
certification in that case, which the Company views as a
favorable development in that proceeding. On June3, 2003,
the plaintiffs in Rose filed a notice of appeal. On
September8, 2003, the Commissioner appointed by the Court
of Appeals denied review of the Rose court decision. On
October10, 2003, the Rose plaintiffs filed a motion
seeking to modify the Commissioners ruling, to which the
Company responded on October30, 2003. The Court of Appeals
denied the plaintiffs motion on November26, 2003.
Following the denial by the Court of Appeals, the
plaintiffs counsel filed 14county-wide putative
class actions in Washington with substantially the same claims
as in Rose. The purported classes in these county-wide
class actions range from approximately 20individuals to
approximately 100individuals. Subsequently, the Company
filed motions to dismiss and/or stay the class allegations in
each of the county-wide actions. Four of these motions were
subsequently granted, permitting the claims to proceed on an
individual basis, two of which were later dismissed on 73 Table of Contents RENT-A-CENTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Continued summary judgment. Accordingly, ten of the county-wide claims are
now proceeding as putative county-wide class actions and two are
proceeding on an individual plaintiff basis. The Company
subsequently filed motions to compel arbitration with respect to
19individual purported plaintiffs and class
representatives in 10counties, which the applicable courts
later granted. Following such motions, approximately
19purported plaintiffs and class representatives remain
with respect to the claims made in the twelve remaining
counties. The plaintiff in one of the counties has filed a
motion to certify a county-wide class. The Company intends to
vigorously oppose class certification. Eighteen of the 19plaintiffs compelled to arbitrate their
claims each filed separate putative nationwide class arbitration
demands. In response, the Company filed motions to clarify the
respective county courts orders compelling arbitration.
Specifically, the Company asked each county court that
previously struck all class allegations to make clear that the
arbitration plaintiffs in those counties could not pursue any
class claims, and the Company asked each county court in those
counties that allowed plaintiffs to plead putative county-wide
class claims, to make clear that such plaintiffs could only
pursue county-wide claims. The three courts that granted the
Companys motions to compel arbitration and had previously
struck all class allegations granted the Companys motions
and ruled that the plaintiffs could not pursue any class
arbitration claims. Five courts ruled that the arbitration
plaintiffs could only pursue county-wide class arbitration
claims, and two of the county courts refused to limit the
arbitration plaintiffs ability to pursue class arbitration
demands. Eighteen of the 19plaintiffs compelled to
arbitrate have filed a demand for arbitration. The Company
intends to vigorously oppose these class arbitration demands,
including vigorously challenging the ability of the plaintiffs
to pursue in arbitration, on a putative nation-wide class basis,
claims which were previously premised on Washington state law. Although the wage and hour laws and class certification
procedures of Oregon, California and Washington contain certain
differences that could cause differences in the outcome of the
pending litigation in these states, the Company believes the
claims of the purported classes involved in each are without
merit. The Company cannot assure you, however, that it will be
found to have no liability in these matters. ColorTyme Guarantee. ColorTyme is a party to an agreement
with Wells Fargo Foothill, Inc., who provides $500million
in aggregate financing to qualifying franchisees of ColorTyme
generally of up to five times their average monthly revenues.
Under the Wells Fargo agreement, upon an event of default by the
franchisee under agreements governing this financing and upon
the occurrence of certain other events, Wells Fargo can assign
the loans and the collateral securing such loans to ColorTyme,
with ColorTyme paying the outstanding debt to Wells Fargo and
then succeeding to the rights of Wells Fargo under the debt
agreements, including the right to foreclose on the collateral.
An additional $150million of financing is provided by
Texas Capital Bank, National Association under an agreement
similar to the Wells Fargo financing. Rent-A-Center East
guarantees the obligations of ColorTyme under each of these
agreements, excluding the effects of any amounts that could be
recovered under collateralization provisions, up to a maximum
amount of $650million, of which $266million was
outstanding as of December31, 2004. Mark E. Speese,

The option data above does not include the 554,012 stock
options, with an approximate fair value of $61million,
assumed as part of the purchase price for the acquisition of
Rent Rite, Inc. in May of 2004. At December31, 2004, the
weighted average remaining contractual life and exercise price
for the Rent Rite options, all of which are exercisable, were
501years and $3062, respectively. No options were issued
to non-employees during 2004, 2003 or 2002. NoteN Employee Benefit Plan Rent-A-Center sponsors a defined contribution pension plan under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code for all
employees who have completed at least three months of service.
Employees may elect to contribute up to 50% of their eligible
compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to limitations.
Rent-A-Center may make discretionary matching contributions to
the 401k plan. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Rent-A-Center made
matching cash contributions of $42million 42million, and $37million, respectively, which
represents 50% of the employees contributions to the
401k plan up to an amount not to exceed 4% of each
employees respective compensation. Employees are permitted
to elect to purchase Rent-A-Center common stock as part of their
401k plan. As of December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, 160 190% and 140%, respectively, of the total plan assets
consisted of Rent-A-Centers common stock. NoteO Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash
equivalents, senior debt, and subordinated notes payable. The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value at December31, 2004 and 2003, because of the short
maturities of these instruments. The Companys senior debt
is variable rate debt that re-prices frequently and entails no
significant change in credit risk, and as a result, fair value
approximates carrying value. The fair value of the subordinated
notes payable is estimated based on discounted cash flow

For 2004, 2003, and 2002, the number of stock options that were
outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per common share because their exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common stock and,
therefore anti-dilutive, was 942,972, 66,250 and 2,186,250,
respectively. NoteQ Unaudited Quarterly Data Summarized quarterly financial data for 2004 and 2003 is as

Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as defined in Rule13a-15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual
report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Based on the evaluation conducted by
management and solely as a result of the failure to file a
Form8-K as described in the paragraph below, our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December31, 2004,
our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
reports we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On December8, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors awarded bonuses with respect to the year
ended December31, 2004, established salaries for the 2005
fiscal year, and adopted a cash bonus program for the 2005
fiscal year in which our named executive officers are eligible
to participate. In reviewing the actions taken by the
Compensation Committee, management now believes that the
adoption by the Compensation Committee of the cash bonus program
should have been previously reported by us on a Form8-K.
The information which would have been set forth in the
Form8-K filing is set forth in Item9B of this
report. We have taken remedial steps to improve the
communication and procedures with respect to capturing this type
of compensation information for future periods, and will
continue to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures in
an effort to improve such disclosure controls and procedures
where we deem necessary or advisable. Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Please refer to Managements Annual Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting on page45 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting As previously reported in our Quarterly Report on Form10-Q
for the quarter ended September30, 2004, we improved our
internal controls pertaining to our financial reporting of tax
related matters during that quarter. During the quarter ended
December31, 2004, management and the Audit Committee
evaluated these internal controls and determined that no
additional action was necessary. For the quarter ended
December31, 2004, there have been no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 79 Table of Contents
